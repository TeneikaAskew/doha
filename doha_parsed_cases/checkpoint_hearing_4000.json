Without objection from Department counsel, I reopened the record and \nadmitted into evidence AE E. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 3, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since May 2018. \nHe has taken some college courses. He is married and has two children, ages five and \none. He has held a security clearance since 2019. (Tr. 5-6, 21, 26; GE1) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from October 2010 \nto June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used and purchased marijuana from about March 2019 \nto about 2021, while having access to classified information (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he \npurchased marijuana from January 2011 to December 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on his June 2018 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug use and purchases as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.c above. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) \nApplicant admitted all of his illegal drug use and purchases, and his deliberate \nfalse answer given on his 2018 SCA. He began using marijuana in 2010 and starting \npurchasing it in 2011. He used marijuana on a daily basis from 2011 through June 2021. \nHe purchased marijuana from 2011 through December 2020. He claimed that his use and \npurchase of marijuana was because he suffered from anxiety and using marijuana helped \nhim with it. He admitted that he was never diagnosed by a medical professional before \nMarch 2021 with anxiety. At that time, his primary care doctor prescribed him the drug \nEscitalopram, which is an anxiety medication, but he did not know if he was formally \ndiagnosed with anxiety. He originally took the medication once a day, but now takes it on \nan as-needed basis. He has never seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist about a possible \nanxiety disorder. He claims he has not used marijuana since June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-23, \n27, 29-31; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer) \nApplicant filled out an SCA in June 2018. In Section 23 of the SCA, he was asked \nif, within the last seven years, he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances.

He admitted his \nanswer was false. He answered falsely to conceal his past use of marijuana. He was \naware his employer had a drug-free work policy, and he signed an agreement to adhere \nto that policy. He was also aware that using marijuana violated federal and state law. He \nalso understood that he was granted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his false \nanswer to Section 23 of his 2018 SCA. He continued to use marijuana after being granted \na security clearance in 2019 through June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-27; GE 2) \nApplicant admitted that from May 2021 through June 2021, when he claims to have \nstopped using marijuana, he had access to classified information. He claimed he did not \npurchase marijuana during this same time frame. As of the date of his background \ninterview in July 2021, he had not disclosed his marijuana use to his employer. (Tr. 32\u00ad\n33; GE 3, p.6) \nApplicant completed and submitted a second SCA in June 2021. He admitted \nusing marijuana in this SCA beginning in 2010, with his most recent use in June 2021. \nHe also admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He admitted \npurchasing marijuana about once a week from 2011 to December 2020. He also stated \nthat he was now taking medication to prevent further use of marijuana. During his \ntestimony, he explained that the reason he decided to fully disclose his previous \nmarijuana use and purchases at that time was because he just had his second child, he \nnow had prescription medication to aid his anxiety, and he felt it was the right thing to do \nnow that he actually had access to classified information. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1) \nApplicant completed a 30-day inpatient drug treatment program beginning in \nFebruary 2023 and ending in March 2023. He followed that with a \u201cstepped down\u201d 30-day \nprogram from which he was discharged on March 31, 2023. All this treatment post-dated \nhis hearing in January 2023. The letter from the treatment program does not provide a \ndiagnosis, prognosis, or a treatment plan for Applicant. He participated in family \ncounseling where apparently his drug use was discussed. No further information was \nprovided and that counseling ceased in May 2021. His wife does not use marijuana, nor \ndo family members or friends with whom he associates. (Tr. 34-36; AE E) \nApplicant provided letters of support from two work supervisors and a personal \nfriend. Both of his work supervisors expressed the opinion that he was a respected \nmember of the team and presented no security issues. One of the supervisors stated that \n\u201cto my knowledge, he doesn\u2019t abuse alcohol or drugs.\u201d Applicant admitted that he did not \ntell either supervisor about his past drug use for fear that knowing that information might \nimpact their professional opinion of him. His personal friend wrote that he was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s prior drug use, but nonetheless believes that he does not pose a security risk. \n(Tr. 39; AE A-C) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\u00ad\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, between 2010 and June 2021 is supported by his \nadmissions and other evidence. His purchase of marijuana, between 2011 and December \n2020 is supported by his admissions and other evidence. He used marijuana while having \naccess to classified information from May 2021 to June 2021. There is insufficient \nevidence to support that he purchased marijuana during the time frame that he had \naccess to classified information. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply, except \nto the language about his purchase of marijuana while having access to classified \ninformation. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility, and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant used marijuana on a daily basis between 2010 and June 2021. Given \nhis pattern of use, his claimed abstinence beginning in 2021 is not sufficient to overcome \nhis prolonged marijuana use. Although he asserts that he will not use marijuana now that \nhe has prescription medication for his anxiety, he first saw the physician who prescribed \nhis anxiety medication in March 2021. He continued to use marijuana after that date. His \nclaimed recent abstinence is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. The \nfrequency and recency of his past use, and his uses while holding a security clearance \nand, more specifically, after having access to classified information, and after he \ncompleted a first SCA in 2018 cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) apply. While he recently completed a drug \ntreatment program, he did not present evidence of a favorable prognosis by a qualified \nmedical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16.

He was well aware of his responsibilities to \ndisclose his drug use in 2018 when he completed his SCA, but he failed to do so. He did \nnot make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous falsifications. Although he \nultimately disclosed his drug use and purchases when completing his 2021 SCA, he was \ngranted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his earlier false statements. Deliberately \nproviding false information on an SCA is not a minor offense. It strikes at the heart of the \nsecurity clearance investigation process. These actions raise questions about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Although Applicant claims he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future, his credibility is suspect. While he recently received drug treatment, \nno prognosis was forthcoming and therefore, it is too soon to determine what overall \nimpact that will have. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s anxiety issues, \nhis recent drug treatment, and his letters of support. However, I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his continued use after obtaining a security \nclearance. He also deliberately falsified his 2018 SCA, which resulted in him receiving a \nsecurity clearance. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except the \nlanguage, \u201cand purchased,\u201d \nwhich I find in favor of Applicant) \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 1) After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been married since 2013. She and her husband \nhave two children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. She is currently enrolled in \nan on-line university.

She was \nunable to continue because she became unemployed and did not have sufficient money \nto make payments. She did not submit any evidence indicating that she made any \npayments on her student loans while previously working with Law Firm M. (Item 2 at 48) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from June 2022, \nNovember 2021, and September 2020, the SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts, which \ntotaled about $143,817. They included eight charged-off student loans, which totaled \nabout $136,317. There are six medical debts and two consumer debts, which total about \n$7,500. The loans and debts became delinquent between 2015 and 2021. (Items 3, 4, \nand 5) The status of these allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h: Applicant took out these student loans between 2005 and \n2008. They are being reported as charged off in Applicant\u2019s credit reports. The last activity \ndate for the loans is noted as 2015. With her September 2022 Answer, she included a \ncopy of a contract she signed in September 2022, with Law Firm M to address her student \nloans.

B) \nThe student loans remain unresolved. \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of \nEducation (ED) placed all federal student loans in forbearance and has since extended \nthe student loan payment pause through June 2023. The pause includes the following \nrelief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nstopped \ncollection \non \ndefaulted \nloans. \n(See \nFederal \nStudent \nAid: \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.) Applicant did not establish she \nwas unable to arrange a payment plan and make some payments for several years before \nMarch 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleged an $800 debt owed to a collection agency for a credit card debt. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay $9.00 a month for 85 \nmonths. She made one payment in September 2022. (Item 1) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n and 1.p alleged medical debts owed to a credit services \ncompany that were incurred in 2020. The amounts owed are $2,860, $1,268, $1,009, \n$583, and $162. Applicant submitted letters from the credit services company stating that \ndebts were returned to the underlying medical system and cancelled in November and \nDecember 2022. (Ex. A and Ex. B) These debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleged a $634 debt owed to a credit card company. This debt was \npaid in May 2021. (Item 1) It is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleged a $222 debt owed to a creditor for medical services. Applicant \npaid it in December 2021. (Item 1) It is resolved. \nApplicant submitted two monthly budgets she established with Law Firm M. One \nwas drafted in September 2022 and the second one was drafted in November 2022. Her \nSeptember 2022 budget reported her net monthly income as $8,518 and included rental \nincome. It listed numerous expenses that totaled $5,661, leaving $2,857 remaining at the \nend of the month. Some of those expenses were a mortgage payment, a car payment, \nvarious insurance payments, transportation costs, a $150 payment to the IRS, payments \non four credit cards, and a $1,400 payment on her student loans per her contract with the \nLaw Firm M. (Item 1) \nApplicant\u2019s November 2022 budget reported her net monthly income as $2,735 \nand did not list any rental income. Her expenses totaled $979. They included gasoline, \ninternet, groceries, and a few other items mentioned in her September 2022 budget, but \nnot all of the expenses included in the September 2022 budget.

B at 13) Applicant did not provide \nan explanation for the large discrepancies between the two budgets. \nApplicant acknowledged that she has made financial mistakes by ignoring her \nfinancial responsibilities, which resulted in her debts becoming delinquent. She said she \ntakes responsibility for them. (Item 2 at 58) \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may be \nmade. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant accumulated over $136,000 in delinquent student loans that she took out \nbetween 2005 and 2008, which were charged off in 2015. She also accumulated about \n$7,500 in consumer and medical debts that became delinquent between 2018 and 2020. \nShe did not begin to address some of her debts until 2021. The evidence raises the above \ntrustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising under this guideline. Four potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s large student loan debt has been outstanding since 2015, with little or \nno evidence of steps taken to resolve it. In 2021, she resolved two credit card debts and \none medical debt, and in November and December 2022 her other five medical debts \nwere resolved. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) for her \nstudent loans and they continue to cast doubt about her judgment. There is evidence to \nestablish mitigation for the credit cards and medical debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to them. \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. Some of these circumstances were beyond her control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She did not provide evidence to demonstrate that she attempted to \nresponsibly manage her debts as they were accumulating or contacting her creditors. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nIn September 2022, Applicant again hired Law Firm M to help resolve her student \nloans. She apparently was financially unable to begin payments on that contract, which \nwas to start on October 25, 2022, and so she signed another contract with Law Firm M in \nNovember 2022, which was to begin on November 25, 2022. The substance of the two \ncontracts was the same, except for the starting date. There is no mention in either contract \nthat Applicant was required to participate in credit or financial counseling, and there is no \nproof that she did so outside of that contract. To-date, there is no evidence that she has \nmade any payment into the November 2022 payment plan, although she had an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence after receiving the FORM in December 2022 \nand having had until mid-January 2023 to submit some. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans are not under control or coming under control. There is \ninsufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) as to those \ndebts. Applicant submitted evidence that she resolved five medical debts and three \nconsumer debts, thereby establishing that those are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies to \nthem. \nApplicant stated that she earned about $125,000 in 2022. Her September 2022 \nbudget corroborates that income and listed common ongoing expenses such as a \nmortgage payment, utilities, credit card payments, etc. However, her November 2022 \nbudget projected an entirely different financial picture in terms of the amount of her \nincome and number of expenses. She provided no explanation for the large discrepancies \nbetween the two budgets, which created questions about her veracity and financial \nreliability that are the underpinnings of AG \u00b6 18. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Based on the evidence, including the large \ndiscrepancies in two budgets that Applicant submitted that are two months apart, and the \nlack of an established track record of responsible financial management, Applicant failed \nto meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under the guideline \nfor financial considerations. Continuation of her financial issues is likely, and the potential \nfor coercion or duress remains undiminished. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n              \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.i through 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $13,000 in delinquent non-student-loan debt. Despite her \nclaims that she was working to resolve her debts, she failed to provide any evidence that \nshe has contacted any of the creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e, and 1.i \nto establish payment arrangements. Nor has she provided documentation to demonstrate \nthat she has resolved those debts or is not responsible for those debts. \nApplicant attended college courses between 2009 and 2015. Starting in 2017, she \nwas required to make student loan payments. She made approximately four $189 \npayments toward her two consolidated student loans in 2018; her last payment was in \nApril 2018. These loans total over $76,000. There is no evidence in the record that she \nmade any subsequent payments or contacted the ED prior to the enactment of the \nCARES Act in March 2020. It is very likely that her loans fall under the CARES Act, and \nher payments have been suspended since March 2020. However, the record reflects that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe was almost two years behind on her payments prior to March 2020, and she has not \ndemonstrated a plan as to how she intends to make payments when the CARES Act is \nsuspended. \nI considered that Applicant is a single mother of three; however, the record is \nabsent any evidence of an effort by her to resolve her debts or prove that the outstanding \ndebts are not her responsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient that she has acted \nresponsibly or made a good-faith effort to resolve her financial issues. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve her debts, large and small, indicates her financial \nissues are an ongoing and continuing concern. Therefore, her behavior continues to cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For the foregoing reasons, \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of proof and persuasion. \nShe did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish her \neligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant did not submit \nany response. The Government\u2019s evidence is admitted into the record. The case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n, and 1.p), except for \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.o, 1.q, and 1.r. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since August 2016, as a supply technician. He holds an associate degree, a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s degrees. He is married for the second time and has \none adult child. (Items 3-4). \nApplicant served in the U.S Army from 1994 to 2001. He also served in the Army \nNational Guard from 2002 to 2010. He was honorably discharged. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant incurred 18 delinquent debts, comprised of student \nloans and consumer debts totaling approximately $130,000 (of which approximately \n$100,000 derive from his student loans) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.l-1.m). Two of the \nstudent loan accounts appear to be duplicates and I find in favor of Applicant on those \ndebts (SOR \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.i and SOR \u00b6 1.m is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.j). \nApplicant admitted the 11 delinquent student loans of approximately $100,000 in \nhis SOR answer. He further stated during his background investigative interview, that he \nhad no reason to dispute these debts. A credit report reveals that his student loans were \nassigned for collection between 2010 and 2016. Applicant claimed the loans were put in \ndeferment for a period. He failed to provide any documentary evidence that he \ncontacted the lenders, set up any payment plans for his student loans, or paid any of \nthe accounts. They remain unresolved. (Items 2, 4, and 5) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed seven delinquent consumer accounts \ntotaling approximately $17,000. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 11.k, and 1.f-1.r) He admitted these debts in his \nbackground interview and in his SOR answer, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q-1.r, which he \ndenied. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r no longer appear on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report and \nare resolved for him. The remaining debts are reported as delinquent debts in credit \nreports from October 2021 and June 2022. He provided no documentary evidence \nshowing that he contacted the creditors, established payment plans, or paid any of the \nremaining debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has over $100,000 of delinquent student loans and failed to pay about \n$17,000 in other consumer debts. I find both the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and remain unresolved. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. He did not present circumstances that were beyond his control that \ncontributed to his financial problems and the evidence does not support a finding that he \nhas taken responsible actions to address his debts.

AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. His financial issues are not under control. He has not shown a good-faith effort to \naddress his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r, but it does not apply to the \nremaining SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his military service and \nwork as a contractor, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k, 1.n-1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m, 1.q-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GE 1; Tr. \n46) He was subsequently interviewed on April 8, 2022, by an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator regarding his marijuana use.

In his SOR Answer, \nsubmitted through counsel, he stated: \n[Applicant] admits to using marijuana sparingly, approximately two (2) \ndozen times from May 1995 to his last and most recent use in November \n2020. [Applicant] voluntarily disclosed his past marijuana use on his first \nSF-86 application in 2000, During [Applicant\u2019s] personnel subject \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterview, he was subsequently asked about his drug use. Candidly, \n[Applicant] explained that he had smoked marijuana approximately two (2) \ndozen times since 1995. [Applicant] was forthright with his responses and \nalso indicated that he had not used any other illegal drugs, other than \nmarijuana and had never tested positive on any drug test. Given the \ninfrequent nature of [Applicant\u2019s] use over such a long period of time (over \n20 years) he could not recall the specific details of each use. [Applicant] \nwas also candid regarding his most recent use in November 2020. During \nthis time, it was over Thanksgiving weekend, and he smoked marijuana at \na family gathering with his wife\u2019s sister and her husband. This was a lapse \nin judgment on the part of [Applicant] and he has not used any drugs since \nNovember 2020, a period of over two (2) years. He also has no intention \nto use illegal drugs in the future as shown through his signed statement of \nintent and negative drug tests. [Applicant] takes full responsibility for his \nactions and poor judgment he exhibited over two (2) years ago over \nThanksgiving weekend. He has taken several steps to ensure similar \nconduct is not repeated in the future through a favorable substance abuse \nevaluation and taking an online drug and alcohol awareness course. \n(December 22, 2022 SOR Answer, pgs. 7-8) \nApplicant confirmed his marijuana use during his testimony. His first marijuana \nuse occurred at a party in May 1995 when he was 18 years old. He did not recall \nspecific details of his marijuana use over the years given the time lapses between \ninfrequent use. Friends or acquaintances provided him with marijuana on the rare \noccasions that he did use it. (Tr. 25-27, 46-47, 56-58) Since he started working for his \ncurrent employer in 2009, Applicant estimated he used marijuana \u201capproximately once \nevery other year\u201d at social gatherings. (Tr. 28-29, 47, 56-58) Marijuana is legal in \nApplicant\u2019s state of residence under state law, but not under federal law. He does not \nhave a medical marijuana card, nor has he ever purchased marijuana from a \ndispensary. He did not reimburse any of his friends or acquaintances for the marijuana \nthey provided him. (Tr. 48) \nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in November 2020. His \nsister-in-law, her husband, and children were visiting from out of town over \nThanksgiving weekend. Applicant\u2019s wife and her sister have \u201ca complicated relationship\u201d \nand had \u201ca pretty intense argument\u201d in front of the children on Thanksgiving Day. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws had marijuana in their possession that they had legally purchased \nfrom a dispensary. On the Saturday evening after Thanksgiving, the four adults smoked \nmarijuana after the children had gone to bed. Applicant \u201cunfortunately\u201d did not think \nabout his clearance at the time of consumption. He had not worked on any classified \nprojects up until that point. (Tr. 29-32) \nApplicant has not been offered any marijuana since November 2020 and has no \nintention of using marijuana in the future. Since then, Applicant has not been in any \nenvironment where drugs were involved. He understands holding a clearance is a \nprivilege and understands that those who are extended that privilege are required to \nabide by all the rules and regulations. He further understands that clearance holders are \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequired to abide by all the rules and regulations outside of work as well. Applicant \nstated that he will never use marijuana again. (Tr. 32-34) He elaborated: \nThe risks of using marijuana again is just \u2013 is \u2013 the consequences of doing \nso are too great. I have a much \u2013 much firmer understanding of the \nconsequences of what \u2013 of what doing that kind of thing will do. It will be \ndetrimental to my career. It will be detrimental to my ability to provide for \nmy family. Furthermore, I am on a program right now where I do access \nclassified information on a need-to-know basis. The responsibilities that \nyou just outlined that come with the privilege of having a security \nclearance, I guess they are \u2013 they are in the forefront of my mind each \nand every single day. I \u2013 I am reminded on a daily basis that I am \naccessing classified information, that I have a responsibility to safeguard \nthat information, so nothing to \u2013 I just simply don\u2019t want to do anything that \ncould in any way, shape or form jeopardize my ability to continue growing \nin my current career path. (Tr. 34) \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not use marijuana. She fully supports his abstinence from \nmarijuana. He does not have any friends or acquaintances who use marijuana. If any of \nhis friends or acquaintances ever did offer him marijuana, his answer would be a firm \nhard, \u201cNo. Please keep it away from me.\u201d (Tr. 48-49, 55-56) He understands that even \nthough marijuana is legal in his state of residence, its possession and use are illegal \nunder federal law. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant was queried regarding an October 18, 1999 subject interview \nstatement in which he stated that he had no intentions of using illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He was 22 years old in October 1999. (Tr. 35-36, 56; GE 5) He confirmed his \ntestimony that he does not intend to use drugs in the future and explained the difference \nbetween \u201cthen and now\u201d: \nA couple of things (are different). Number one, I just received a \u2013 received \na promotion where I am supporting a classified program. I \u2013 again, I\u2019m \naccessing classified information on a daily basis. In order to keep my job, I \nneed to be granted a Top Secret clearance to get to my next caveat [sic] \nof \u2013 of program \u2013 level clearance. The consequences of \u2013 the \nconsequences of not doing that \u2013 that transgression of smoking marijuana \ncould cause or just \u2013 it\u2019s just too great of a price to pay. It\u2019s not \u2013 it is \nabsolutely positively, no way worth the risk.  \nOther thing that has changed between then and now, I am married. I now \nhave a family. I\u2019m the sole breadwinner of my family. So providing income \nfor my wife and three children is probably my \u2013 my number one priority in \nlife and doing anything to jeopardize my ability to do that is not something \nI\u2019m willing to do, especially something like smoking marijuana.  \nI think the other \u2013 the other thing that has changed since 1999 to today, \nthis whole experience, reading the Statement of Reasons, hiring you, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoming into this courtroom for this \u2013 this hearing today, I have an \nabsolutely crystal clear understanding of what the consequences of that \u2013 \nof those actions are going to be, I think. Past transgressions, I lost sight of \nthe consequences. Being so firmly aware of what they are now, I \u2013 I \ncannot imagine ever doing it again. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to ever do this \nagain. I don\u2019t want to ever see a Statement of Reasons again. I don\u2019t want \nto ever be in this courtroom again. To be frank with you. (Tr. 36-37) \nApplicant affirmed that he has grown as an individual over the past 30 years and \nlearned from his past mistakes. (Tr. 37-38) His November 2020 use of marijuana \noccurred as a result of a stressful family situation. Since then, he has adopted a more \ndisciplined approach to physical exercise, that he has \u201cfound is probably my single best \nthing I do to help cope with stress,\u201d and spends more time with his children. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn, statement of intent, dated November 11, \n2022, to avoid any future drug use or other illegal drugs both presently and in the future, \nwith the understanding that any drug violation will result in the automatic revocation of \nclearance. (Tr. 39-40; AE I) He completed a four-hour drug and alcohol awareness \nclass on December 9, 2022, a four-hour behavior modification class on December 10, \n2022, and a four-hour marijuana education class on December 10, 2022. (Tr. 40-41; \nAE K - AE M) A highly credentialed licensed psychologist (LP) completed a \ncomprehensive substance abuse evaluation of Applicant. LP\u2019s summary of the \npsychological evaluation, dated December 14, 2022, states in part: \nIt appears, however, that the Top Secret investigative process gave \n[Applicant] pause to reflect on his marijuana use. He took time to process \nthe matter in an intentional mindful way that brought him to new insight \nabout it. He then acted by disclosing his past drug use despite the \npossible consequences for his career. As the process progressed to an \nSOR, the gravity of the situation seems to have set in for him. In colloquial \nterms, [Applicant] is sufficiently \u201cfreaked out\u201d by the potential loss of his \nclearance, his job, and his financial security that it now seems exceedingly \nunlikely he will ever use marijuana again.  \nCONCLUSION: Based on all the available data, [Applicant] does not have \nany substance use condition or behavioral tendencies that could impact \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in the context of safeguarding \nclassified information or working in a cleared setting.

These individuals fully support the \ncontinuation and upgrade of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE C, AE P; Tr. 58-61) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nposition.\u201d The record established these two disqualifying conditions. Further review is \nrequired. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications. The SecEA memorandum states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions.

Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd.

May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s self-reported marijuana use of approximately two dozen times spanned a \n25-year period from 1995 to 2020, to include use after being granted a Secret clearance \nin 2011. Appellant volunteered the information about his marijuana involvement. His \nmarijuana involvement was not detected in a urinalysis, in a post-polygraph interview, \nthrough OPM interviews of his associates, or through a law enforcement investigation. I \nam confident that he will keep his commitment not to possess and or use marijuana in \nthe future. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. He recognizes the importance of being a responsible family \nmember and employee, and that his actions can affect others. He also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, change in behavior, and support from his family, friends, and associates, \nin addition to his 27 months of abstinence, are indicative of an individual who wants to \nright his course. The absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his \npromise not to use illegal drugs in the future eliminate doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal \ndrug use. Applicant\u2019s statements are further corroborated by a comprehensive and \nthorough drug and alcohol assessment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. Applicant has engaged in a significant amount of self-\nreflection regarding his behavior and recognizes that such behavior is incompatible with \nholding a security clearance. Applicant has committed to disassociation from drug-using \ncontacts and avoiding any environment where drugs are used. Lastly, he provided a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that he is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \nthe contribution he is making as an employee. His performance further reflects his work \nbehavior is not indicative of someone with a drug problem. As an employee, he is \nviewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At his hearing \nApplicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career \nand family plans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes \nconsistent with total abstinence of involvement with all illegal drugs. \nI evaluated Applicant\u2019s credibility after assessing his demeanor, overall candor on \nother matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers.

Drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is now willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted with a \nsecurity clearance. He honestly and voluntarily self-reported his infrequent past drug use \nknowing that such disclosure could jeopardize his clearance eligibility and future \nemployment. Applicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him and vouch for his \ntrustworthiness. He has a history of stable employment and a strong work ethic. This \nlevel of support and self-introspection makes his continued success more likely. \nApplicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to remaining drug free. He \nhas multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was \nserious, candid, and credible at the hearing.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \n     (a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant has established a long history of \npurchasing, possessing, and using of marijuana in violation of state and federal law. His \nactions raise questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. He has not provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. He has sought approval as a current \nmedical marijuana user. In ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016), the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nDOHA Appeal Board noted that the DNI's 2014 memorandum specifically stated that state \nlaws permitting the use of marijuana \u201cdo not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines[.]\u201d The Board also observed that \u201cDOHA proceedings are not a \nproper forum to debate the pros and cons of whether marijuana should be legal for some \npurposes, how it should be classified as a controlled substance, or the merits of DoD \npolicy concerning drug abuse.\u201d Id. See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, however, that while several states have decriminalized \nmarijuana or allowed its use for medical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana \nremains subject to the applicable disqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d) Because he \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant's admissions and \nexplanations, along with the medical explanation. Applicant\u2019s position on marijuana was \nclear concerning his use of medical marijuana and the reasons for its use. However, \nmarijuana remains illegal under Federal law and for cleared individuals. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 29, \n2022. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2023. On June 23, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing would be \nconducted via video conference on July 18, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted without objection. Applicant  \ntestified. After the hearing, he timely submitted by August 18, 2023, nine exhibits marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I. AE A through AE I were admitted without objection. \nAlso marked were Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1 through 5, emails explaining AE A through AE \nI. HE 1 through 5 were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJuly 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old, a high school graduate with some college credit credits. \nHe was married in March 2007 and divorced in March 2015. He has no children. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2003 to 2009 and in the inactive reserves \nfrom 2009 to 2011. He was honorably discharged. (Tr. 18-20.) He was deployed to \nAfghanistan from March 2012 to October 2014, while employed by a defense contractor. \n(Tr. 26.) Since August 2018, he has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor. (GE 1.) He believes his security clearance expired in 2014, and that his \nemployment depends on him having a clearance. (Tr. 18-29.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (a) owes back federal income \ntaxes of $368,213 for tax years 2011 through 2015; (b) owes back state taxes of $15,000 \n(tax years are not alleged); and (c) owes the DOD $930. (SOR.) Applicant admitted those \nallegations with explanations. (Answer.) \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.a, his response is summarized as follows: \nI admit. I made the initial mistake of not tracking my taxes during the \nyears I was overseas. To address the issue, I started working with a tax \nhelp company. That was in 2018. Up to that point, I hadn\u2019t heard anything \nfrom the IRS. Once the tax company started doing their initial inquiries, I \nwas bombarded with letters from the IRS. I had no idea how badly the fees \nand interest stacked up. Unfortunately, between how tax help business \nwork, the slow pace of the IRS and the onset of Covid, this is still \nunresolved. I have worked with a few different tax help companies, at one \npoint I retained a tax lawyer and finally I am working with a CPA who I feel \ndeals with me in an honest fashion. Over the last four years, I have agreed \nto two separate payment arrangements with the IRS to where the money \nwould automatically be debited from my account and both times, no money \nwas debited and no contact was made in regards to updating the situation. \nThe [IRS] payment arrangement in July 2020 was uploaded through the \ntax company website so I don\u2019t have a copy. The one from this year \n[January 2022] I will attach to this statement [the Answer]. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nI will readily admit that this has been the mistake of my lifetime.

I have increased my withholding on my initial forms for the \nlast seven years so nothing is added to what I owe . . . . \nAttached to Applicant\u2019s Answer is an Installment agreement signed by him dated \nJanuary 13, 2022, calling for a monthly payment of $2,250 beginning March 28, 2022. It \nwas not, however, countersigned or approved by the IRS. Applicant did not submit the \nJuly 2020 payment arrangement with the IRS mentioned above, because he could not \nfind it. (Tr. 59.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about SOR \u00b6 1.a was consistent with his Answer about that \nallegation. On September 20, 2018, he hired a tax help company (Company A), when he \ndiscovered how bad his federal tax situation had gotten while he was overseas. He \nattributed part of that to his going through a divorce in 2014 to 2015. Before he hired \nCompany A, he had not received any notices from the IRS. It was not until late 2018 or \nearly 2019 that he began receiving notices from the IRS. His agreement with Company A \nwas for him to pay the company $6,000 ($300 per month) plus a $28 per month fee in \ninstallments for its assistance in resolving his federal tax issues. Company A does not \nhandle state tax issues. (Tr. 33-40, 56; AE B.) His bank records show a total of $6,945 \nand a total of $588 in fees paid to Company A or its affiliates from September 2018 \nthrough February 2020. (AE A.) He never fired Company A and made all payments under \nthe agreement. (Tr. 61-62.) This contradicts later testimony that he fired Company A in \nMarch 2022. (Tr.78.) \nApplicant testified that Company A began filing his late returns in January 2019 for \ntax years 2010 to 2018. (Tr. 39-41.) His tax transcripts show that his returns for tax years \n2012 through 2015 were filed on March 25, 2019. His returns for tax years 2017 and 2016 \nwere filed on January 7, 2019 and March 4, 2019, respectively. (GE 3.) On May 10, 2023, \nhe hired a new accountant (CPA B) who filed his 2021, 2022 taxes, and will file his 2023 \ntaxes. (Tr. 78; AE I.) \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits AE D, E, F, G, and H, chronicle Applicant\u2019s efforts from August \n2019 to January 2022 to prod Company A, and in turn the IRS, to address his sizeable \ntax delinquency. The following are salient excerpts from those exhibits (quotations are \nfrom Company A emails to Applicant): \n \n\u201cI was told [by IRS] that due to the balance ($338,301.53), it must be assigned to \na Revenue Officer. This can take 1-4 months. The good news is, collection action should \nstop while in this process. It also gives us time to get your financials together so we can \nhave a plan when they call.\u201d (AE D 8/24/19.) \n\u201cIRS has had longer delays in handling these [cases] over the last few months.\u201d \n(AE E 1/24/20.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n          \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cThe IRS has decided that they will take the next 90 days to assign you a Revenue \nOfficer. During this time they have placed your case on hold and will not pursue any \nfurther collection activity against you.\u201d (AE F 11/24/20.) \n\u201cThis is a quick email to let you know that we have not yet received any \ncommunication from the IRS assigning a Revenue Officer to your case. The good news \nis that a HOLD has been placed on all potential activity against you while they assign this \nperson.\u201d (AE G 2/23/21.) \n\u201cI contacted the IRS this past week because we have not yet seen any information \nregarding the Revenue officer they are assigning to your case. Their response was that \nthey have not yet assigned your case to a Revenue officer and have held off on all \ncollection activity until they appoint an agent to you.\u201d (AE G 4/11/21.) \n\u201cI have attached the following form for your signature: IRS Form 433D \u2013 Direct \nDebit Form (Installment Agreement). Please print, sign and either scan or fax the form \nback to me at the fax number below.\u201d (AE H 1/11/22.) This is the Installment Agreement \nApplicant signed and dated on January 20, 2022, and attached to his Answer. This \nInstallment Agreement is the last communication of record between him and the IRS via \nCompany A. The IRS has not yet approved or disapproved the Installment Agreement he \nsigned, dated, and returned to Company A in January 2022. Nor has it assigned a \nRevenue Officer. \nPending a response from the IRS, Applicant has filed his federal income taxes \nthrough CPA B. He is current on all his federal income taxes through 2022. To be sure \nthat he is owed a refund each year, he does not take any exemptions or deductions he \ncould otherwise take. That way, he always has a refund that the IRS takes to apply to \nback taxes. (Tr. 71-72.) CPA B has also advised him to do an offer in compromise, and \nthat is Applicant\u2019s goal now, while awaiting the IRS to act on his January 2022 Installment \nAgreement or assign a Revenue Officer. . \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.b, his delinquent state tax of $15,000, Applicant responded: \u201cThis is \nthe same situation as subparagraph a. In order to make a payment arrangement with the \nState . . . , I\u2019ve been advised to work with the IRS first as it takes precedence.\u201d (Answer.) \nApplicant testified that he spoke with a tax preparer in that State who calculated \nthat Applicant owed $15,000 for tax years 2010 to 2015. He filed those returns in 2020. \nHe was advised by Company A that he should wait until the IRS issue has been resolved \nbefore paying the state taxes. (Tr. 74-75.) His plan is to work on an offer in compromise \nwith the IRS, and if that gets resolved, do a payment plan with the State. The $15,000 is \nsomething he can afford. He is not opposed to paying the State first, but that is not what \nhis financial advisors told him. Even the State told him to take care of the IRS first. (Tr. \n76-77.) \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.c, a debt to DOD for $930, Applicant responded: \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure \nbut I think it\u2019s for a set of body armor that I signed for when I first deployed to Afghanistan \nin 2010 as a civilian contractor. When I tried to turn it back in, it was at a different location \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the CIF [Central Issuing Facility] refused to take it as it wasn\u2019t signed out from that \nlocation. I still have the armor packed and cleaned and ready to turn in.\u201d (Answer.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his Answer. This happened about 10 years ago. \nHe has no contacts in the United States to return the gear to. (Tr. 79-84.) The credit report \ndoes not provide a name or a phone number for the collection agency, just an address. \nThe creditor is DOD. The debt was assigned to collections in February 2012. (GE 4.) \nApplicant testified about his personal finances. He reviewed his Personal Financial \nStatement (PFS) (GE 3) and thought it was about accurate. (Tr. 86.) His PFS had a net \nmonthly remainder of $1,535. (GE 3.) His testimony updated that to $1,134. (Tr. 89.) His \njob ($6,000 per month) and a Veterans Administration payment ($150 per month) are his \nonly sources of income. (Tr. 84-85.) He has not taken any vacation since perhaps 2013. \n(Tr. 99.) He has no savings account. (Tr. 90-91.) He uses his checking accounts to pay \nrent and other expenses. At the end of the month, those accounts are about $300 to $400 \nfor expenses and $150 for rent. (Tr. $90-91.) His employer deposits $1.00 per month into \na 401 (k); he has never chosen one or filled out any paperwork for one. (Tr. 90.) \nGiven Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder of $1,134, Department Counsel asked \nwhether even if he had an IRS installment plan like the January 2022 proposed plan \n(calling for $2,250 per month), it was not his intention to make those payments. He \nresponded: \nNo, it was my absolute intention to make those payments. I told \nCompany A that . . . I can\u2019t keep this up. I mean, I\u2019m going to keep it up for \nas long as I can, but at some point the wheels are going to fall off. . . \nCompany A said let go of all my external payments . . . don\u2019t pay your credit \ncards . . . don\u2019t pay your storage . . . don\u2019t pay your medical expenses . . . \neverything outside of like rent and food . . . goes to the IRS . . . [That] \nwouldn\u2019t have been sustainable, because that wouldn\u2019t be good for a \nclearance. I mean, it\u2019s the same thing, I\u2019d still be hurting somewhere else. \n(Tr. 95-96.) \nApplicant clarified Company A\u2019s role. He hired them to file his late federal returns. \nThey helped him file those returns. He did not hire them to pay his debt to the IRS. He \ndid not hire them to handle his state taxes. (Tr.104-105.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . or pay annual Federal, state or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (f) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial woes had \ntheir inception during his overseas deployments from 2010 to 2014, during which time he \nadmittedly failed to track his taxes. That is quite some time ago, but his tax arrearages \nfrom those years of neglect continue to this day and are not fully resolved. That is, they \nare recurring. Those delinquencies are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an \napplicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he confronted. \nIn addition to not tracking his taxes while overseas, Applicant noted his 2014 to \n2015 divorce as a factor. He also noted the slow pace of the IRS and the onset of Covid \nas factors. Those two were beyond his control. The initial circumstances that caused \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems, failure to track his taxes, was largely of his own making. The \ncurrent situation is not, however, just the historic cause of his tax difficulties. It is the \nseemingly immutable stalemate that the IRS has imposed by remaining silent about his \nproposed payment agreement and the agency\u2019s delay in appointing a Revenue Officer to \nhis case. Key were his divorce, the slow pace of the IRS, and Covid. Those were the \ncurrent circumstances largely beyond his control. \nHere, his actions after he discovered his tax thicket were commendable. Before he \napplied for a security clearance in January 2019, in September 2018, he hired Company \nA to advise him and to file his late federal tax returns. This was accomplished by Company \nA filing his late tax returns from January 2019 to March 2019. He successfully undertook \nthat effort before the SOR was issued in August 2022. CPA B then filed his 2021 and \n2022 taxes, and he is now current on all his federal income taxes through 2022. This is \nresponsible conduct, giving him credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe most difficult part of Applicant\u2019s case is his inability to defray any of his \n$368,213 delinquent income taxes, fees, and penalties. In January 2022, via Company \nA, he proposed an installment agreement to the IRS, whereby he would pay $2,250 per \nmonth beginning in March 2022 to retire this arrearage. From August 2019 to January 20, \n2022, when he submitted his proposed installment plan to the IRS, the agency has not \nresponded at all to Company A\u2019s inquiries about his proposal or to the agency\u2019s numerous \npromises to assign a Revenue Officer to his case. It has simply held up any collection \nactions. Applicant\u2019s tax fate is, therefore, in a legal limbo with no end in sight. \nIn the meantime, he continues to file his income tax returns and makes sure that \nhe has a refund that the IRS can intercept to apply to his arrearage. Now it matters little \nwhether he could make his proposed payments. His testimony was that he would do his \nbest for as long as he could. What matters is that his case be assigned to a Revenue \nOfficer to bring the IRS\u2019s considerable resources and expertise to bear on his thorny tax \nissue. As a fallback, he and CPA B are working on an offer in compromise to submit to \nthe IRS. He had a plan and has taken steps to accomplish it. His efforts to engage the \nIRS have been steady and in good faith, and his testimony was honest and credible. On \nthis record and with his finances, he has pursued every alternative that appears to be \navailable. I find that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the debts alleged \nin the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. What is required \nis only that an Applicant have a reasonable plan to pay off his debts, and has taken some \nsteps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 3, 2011). I find that the evidence supports that conclusion here. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for delinquent state taxes of $15,000. Applicant has consulted his tax \nadvisors (CPAs) and a State tax authority. He was advised to rectify his federal tax issues \nbefore addressing his state tax issues. He has simply followed their advice. I find in favor \nof Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for $930. Applicant does not know to whom to return the gear that \nwas issued more than 10 years ago. The credit report sheds little light on that question. \nThe amount owed does not raise national security concerns. And the law does not require \nthe doing of a futile act. See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980). I find in favor of \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Item 3)   \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports and admissions in the record. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose several years ago from his 2013 divorce, \nthey have persisted without any evidence of debt-resolution efforts by him. The August \n2022 credit report in the record shows that his debts have not been reduced. An individual \nentrusted to safeguard sensitive and classified information is expected to act in a \nfinancially responsible manner. During his March 2022 security interview, Applicant \nacknowledged his financial delinquencies and expressed his intent to take no action to \nresolve his delinquent debts. He has not communicated with his creditors or made \npayment arrangements to resolve these delinquent debts. He did not provide any \nevidence of his current financial circumstances with the submission of a monthly budget \nor a personal financial statement. \nAbsent evidence of any debt-resolution efforts or other evidence demonstrating his \nfinancial responsibility, Applicant has not established he possesses the requisite good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness the Government expects when an individual has \nbeen granted access to classified information. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his ongoing financial \ndelinquencies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant experienced financial issues attributed to, what appears to be, a \ncontentious divorce. He has decided to ignore his delinquent creditors and he does not \nintend to take any responsible action to address his delinquent debts. Given the entirety \nof the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. She earned an associate degree in 2015. She married \nin 2015 and has two children from the marriage, ages two and five. She has two other \nchildren from previous relationships, ages 14 and 22.

She does not receive court-ordered child support for her 14-year-old but the \nfather gives the child money. Her husband does the same for his child. (Tr. 14-18, 47) \nApplicant operated a home daycare from 2009 until she closed it in November \n2018. She then had temporary jobs until she obtained full-time employment in March \n2019. She worked for a foster care agency for about two years. She helped place foster \nchildren in homes, but when the pandemic hit, the services were reduced and she was \nlaid off in July 2021. She started her current job with a federal contractor in October 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s husband has been employed since 2016. (Tr. 18-20, 35-37) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to unemployment and to family issues. \nHer mother-in-law had cancer, and she and her husband helped her with medical bills. \nHer mother-in-law did not have insurance. They overextended themselves to help her \nmaintain her obligations because she was unable to work. She passed away in January \n2020. They also had two other family members pass away and they felt an obligation to \nhelp. (Tr. 23-24 \nApplicant testified that she had been making consistent payments on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($25,956) before she closed her daycare business in 2018. After the debt went \nin collection status, she contacted the creditor to make a payment arrangement in about \nJune 2019 after she got a temporary job. She made payments for about six to eight \nmonths but then was unable because of family obligations. She contacted the creditor a \nweek before her hearing and is attempting to find the collection company that owns the \ndebt. She anticipated contacting them and working on a payment arrangement. She has \nreceived settlement offers from other creditors and hopes to make payment arrangements \nbut is unable to at this time because she does not have the money. (Tr. 20-30) \nApplicant current annual salary is approximately $36,000 to $38,000. At her prior \nemployment she earned about $31,000 and was an hourly employee.

She drives for Uber when she can, but with two small \nchildren it is difficult. Her husband works the night shift so they can reduce childcare \nexpenses and one of them can be home. They have no savings, but she does have a \n401k retirement account with about $2,000 in it. She enrolled in a debt consolidation \nprogram in about 2022 but decided the fees, in addition to the monthly payments, were \ntoo expensive. She has contemplated filing for bankruptcy but cannot afford the attorney\u2019s \nfees and intends to research if there is a way to do so with reduced legal fees. Applicant \nhas delayed addressing her delinquent bills because she does not want to contact a \ncreditor when she does not have the money to make a settlement offer or payment plan. \n(Tr. 25, 33-47) \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2021 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing, she disclosed she had one debt that became delinquent in 2016 that she was \nunable to pay because she was unemployed. In her response to government \ninterrogatories, she provided proof that she paid a delinquent debt in April 2022. This debt \nwas not alleged in the SOR. She also said that she was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h \n($733) but she did not provide proof that she made payments or resolved the debt. (Tr. \n30-32; GE 1, 2) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will be not considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination and in a whole-person analysis. \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,746. None have \nbeen paid or resolved. The delinquencies began about 2015, but most of the debts \nbecame delinquent around 2017, 2018 and 2019. In her SOR answer, she denied the \ndebt in \u00b6 1.c. She testified that she is responsible for this debt. She confused it with \nanother account that was paid. Some creditors have offered settlement agreements, but \nshe is unable to accept them at this time. (Tr. 48-60) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \ntestimony, responses to interrogatories, and credit reports from October 2021, May 2022, \nand January 2023. (GE 1-5) \nApplicant has approximately $56,000 in student loans that are in a deferred status \ndue to financial hardship. She has not made payments in five years. She recently received \nnotification that the pandemic deferral was expiring, but her loans will remain deferred \ndue to her financial status. (Tr. 60-61) \nApplicant testified that she intends to pay her delinquent debts and wants to pay \nthem. Her husband testified on her behalf. He affirmed that their finances were impacted \ndue to deaths and illnesses in the family. He has been working extra hours to make more \nmoney and is working parttime as a handyman. Recently his car transmission needed to \nbe replaced and it cost $4,800. It remains at the repair shop while he makes payments. \n(Tr. 62-68) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s debts started to be delinquent in about 2016. None of the SOR debts \nare paid or being resolved. Applicant does not have the resources to pay or resolve her \ndebts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to unemployment, underemployment, \nand helping family members in need. These conditions were beyond her control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. At this point, \nApplicant does not have the resources to pay her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies. There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling. There are not clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. There is no evidence she has \nmade a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Her debts \nremain unresolved and unpaid. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guidelines F, financial \nconsiderations. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, so \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and declared intention to continue using marijuana \nremain a trustworthiness concern. Trustworthiness concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse) are not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nposition of trust is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for national security positions, also known as \nan application for a position of public trust, on August 24, 2021. On August 29, 2022, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse). The DOD CAF issued the SOR \nunder DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017. When Applicant answered the SOR on September 2, 2022, he requested a \ndecision by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) based on the administrative (written) record, without a hearing.  \nOn September 16, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 4. \nItems 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case, the SOR and the Answer.

Applicant \nreceived the FORM on October 5, 2022. No subsequent response from Applicant was \nreceived by DOHA, and the case was assigned to me on January 6, 2023.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, respectively) Applicant admitted both allegations in his \nanswer to the SOR without further comment.

As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n\u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance and trustworthiness \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 U.S. 518, 531 \n(1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion\u201d to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nIt is illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, \nincluding marijuana. (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844) \nAll controlled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their accepted \nmedical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on \nthe body. (\u00a7\u00a7811, 812) Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \n\u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no \naccepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. (\u00a7812(b)(1); See Gonzales v. \nRaich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005)) \nApplicant disclosed on his August 2021 application that he has used marijuana \non a daily basis for the previous five years. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant indicated his intention to continue to use marijuana, despite being \naware of the consequences. He also failed \u201cto clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue\u201d his marijuana use, so AG \u00b6 25(g) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26, including the \nfollowing: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national trustworthiness eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is frequent, recent, and likely ongoing, as he stated \nan intention to continue using marijuana because he enjoys it, notwithstanding any \nresulting consequences. Applicant\u2019s pattern and use of marijuana continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to his \neligibility for a position of public trust, or access to sensitive information. He gave no \nindication that he intends to stop using marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant offered no whole-person evidence to consider. He admitted both \nallegations without comment and did not offer any additional evidence. \nThe only \nexhibits are his application and his interview summary. He disclosed his extensive \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nhistory of frequent, often daily use of marijuana and purchase of it, and indicated without \nreservation that he would continue to do so.  \nApplicant seeks eligibility for a position of public trust, granted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, and marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance \nunder Federal law. He has a recent history and pattern of disregarding Federal law in \nusing and purchasing marijuana. He offered no mitigating evidence to suggest a change \nof heart. \nI conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance misuse. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a trustworthiness clearance. Granting of eligibility for a position of public \ntrust and eligibility for access to sensitive information is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. at 12-20.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old, has never married, and has no children. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2017.

Marijuana Use. Applicant used marijuana socially when she was in college \n(2012-2017). Sharing marijuana was a common way for Applicant and her friends to \nsocialize, and she felt she should join them to maintain their friendship. At times, her \nsocial use was several times a day. By 2013, her use became frequent. In that year she \nreceived a medical marijuana card so that she could buy marijuana in her state legally. \nShe used marijuana \u201cmedically\u201d at that time for anxiety and nausea and to help her sleep. \n(Tr. at 28-31.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant was injured while wake boarding. She seriously damaged \nmuscles and tendons in her leg. Her leg was put in a cast and when the cast was removed, \nshe experienced searing pain. The use of the cast to immobilize her leg was a mistake \nand she developed a serious condition called Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome or CRPS. \nIn her accident she had also damaged her leg nerves, and she has been subsequently \nadvised the worst thing to do with damaged nerves is to immobilize the area of the body \nwhere the nerves have been damaged. Applicant saw eight doctors before being referred \nto her current doctor, who is reputed to be the best doctor for treating her rare condition. \nHe treats her with a very high dose of one prescription medication for her nervous system \nand two other medications. Applicant provided a letter from a pain management doctor \nwho evaluated her. His letter graphically describes the extraordinary level of pain \nApplicant experiences on a daily basis. She also provided a medical article describing her \nrare condition. (Tr. at 28-40, 45; AE B; AE C.) \nDuring the period 2019 to 2021, Applicant only used marijuana at night to help her \nsleep because her condition caused her so much pain. Occasionally, she used marijuana \nduring the day for pain relief. During that period, she underwent multiple surgeries on her \nleg and foot. When she was prescribed opioids after surgeries, she did not use marijuana \nat the direction of her doctors. Her current doctor is aware that in the past she used \nmarijuana for her pain in addition to the medications he prescribed. (Tr. at 28-40.) \nApplicant last used marijuana in August 2021, just before she was hired for her \ncurrent position in September 2021. She stopped using marijuana at that time because \nshe knew it was not legal federally and she did not want to risk losing her job opportunity \nto work for a federal contractor. (Tr. at 24-27.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant candidly admitted that she purchased and used \nmarijuana once after she was hired by her current employer. She had temporarily run out \nof her prescription medication for her nerve pain and needed help to relieve her pain at \nnight so she could sleep. The lack of medication during that period of about six nights \nalso put her at risk of having seizures. One of the uses of her medication is to prevent \nseizures. By running out of the medication, which she takes in very high doses, she \nincreases her risk of seizures. Marijuana reduced that risk because it calms the nervous \nsystem like her medication. (Tr. at 30-40.) \nApplicant is required to refill her prescriptions for the pain medication every three \nmonths and must see her doctor in person to receive the refill prescription. She has \ndifficulty scheduling an appointment with him because he has a busy practice. On this \none occasion, she made a mistake and called a little too late to receive a timely \nappointment. Once she received the new prescription, it took a few more days for the \npharmacy to mail her the medication. She legally purchased the marijuana under her state \nlaw for the limited purpose of filling in the gap due to her lack of medication. She does not \nanticipate having a problem like this in the future. She felt too much anxiety about risking \nher job by using marijuana during that week to ever permit herself to be in that position \nagain. Her job is too important to her. She is anxious to maintain a happy and healthy \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \ntrajectory in her life after so many years of misery due to her condition. (Tr.at 28, 30-33., \n38-40.) \nAt the time Applicant ran out of medication, she was driving two hours each way \nto commute to work. This daily routine made her more susceptible to even greater pain \nwithout her medication. After eight months, she relocated to a new home near her job to \navoid the excessive wear on her fragile condition. (Tr. at 44.) \nApplicant is comfortable with her prescription medications now. She is reducing \nthe amounts of the medication using alternative strategies to relieve her pain. She lives \nby herself with her dog. She is not surrounded by people who use marijuana as she was \nduring her college and subsequent years. She never finds herself in the company of \nothers using marijuana. (Tr. at 32- 35, 37.) \n1.b. Marijuana Purchases. See discussion under 1.c, below. \n1.c. Mushroom Use and Purchases. Applicant wrote in the Answer that she\npurchased and used mushrooms \u201cinconsistently between [about February 2015 and \nabout December 2019] to help with the tough emotional and spiritual part of chronic pain \nat 21 years old.\u201d Her last use of mushrooms was in or about December 2019. When she \nwas diagnosed with CRPS just before her 22nd  birthday, she was devastated and at a \nloss receiving such bad news about her health at her young age. At times, she wanted to \nend her life because her pain was unbearable. She used mushrooms when she was \ndesperate, such as after a failed surgery for her condition. She used mushrooms about \nfive times over nine years. She has no intention to use or purchase mushrooms in the \nfuture, noting in the Answer that she was \u201cdoing much better, thankfully.\u201d Applicant is very \nhappy with her life now and the direction it is going. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 27, 35-36.) \n \n1.d. Intent to Use Cannabis in the Future. In the Answer, Applicant wrote that, \u201cI \nadmit medical cannabis helps my pain and the struggles my pain puts me through, but if \nit means putting my job at risk then I wont use cannabis unless it becomes federally legal.\u201d \nShe credibly testified that she has no future intent to use cannabis. She explained her \nposition further and clarified her statement in her security interview on the subject of her \nfuture intent to use cannabis. She said that in the event that cannabis became legal at \nthe federal level in the future, she would use cannabis again for her medical condition. If \nthere is no change in federal law, then she has no intention to use marijuana in the future. \n(Answer at 2; Tr. at 23-24, 44.) \n1.e. Intent to Use Mushrooms in the Future. At the time of her security interview, \nApplicant candidly commented that she may use cannabis and mushrooms occasionally \nwhen necessary due to pain or for celebratory purposes. She denied in the Answer any \nfuture intent to use mushrooms. She credibly testified that she now has no future intent \nto use mushrooms.

She has an emotional support dog. She rescues injured and \nlost pets and finds them good homes. She is the best condition she has been in for nearly \na decade. She is determined to do what she needs to do to maintain this trajectory and \nhas been extremely honest about her past. She has received a coin of appreciation for \nher excellent work. She describes her job as the culmination of nearly 10 years of hard, \nvery painful work. She is dedicated to maintaining her improved health and her journey \nto an even higher level of recovery. (Tr. at 49-50.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, and her detailed testimony regarding her \nhistory of drug use, establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (b). She also used marijuana for about a \nweek after submitting her e-QIP.

Overall, the \nrecord evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nher conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed the previous SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding \nthe importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant has fully established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1) and (b)(2). \nHer illegal drug use since her accident in 2014 occurred under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Her painful chronic condition had caused her to seek any relief \npossible, and for her the relief came in a combination of prescription medication for her \nseverely damaged nerves and marijuana to help her sleep at night. Since the prospect of \ngaining full-time employment in her field with a federal contractor in 2021, she established \nan extended pattern of abstinence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe one exception to her abstinence was due the unusual circumstances created \nby a timing issue that delayed the delivery of a refill of her most important prescription \nmedication. Applicant has credibly testified that those circumstances will not be repeated \nin the future and that even if she does experience a timing gap in the delivery of her \nmedication, she is equipped today to handle such an emergency without resorting to \nmarijuana. The key difference between then and now is that she no longer spends four \nhours a day in her car commuting to and from her workplace. Without that strain on her \ndisabled body, she is confident that she can treat herself using lawful alternative \nmedications in the event she finds herself without her prescription medications. \nMoreover, Applicant experienced serious anxiety when she broke her abstinence \nfor six nights. Her job and the recovery her employment represent to her is too important \nto her to ever put herself at risk of losing her job in the future. She is committed to never \nrepeating that experience with marijuana. Also, she is committed to never allowing herself \nto run out of medication. Under all of the circumstances presented in this case, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has an even longer period of abstinence in the use of mushrooms. She \nused mushrooms a limited number of times in the past when she felt despair over her \ncondition and her future of living with severe chronic pain. She found that mushrooms \ngave her the perspective and the courage to continue with her struggle. Now that her life \nhas never been better with her job and her independent lifestyle, she has no use for \nmushrooms and will never risk her employment by using them. She has no intention of \never using mushrooms again. \nIn addition, AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2) are applicable. Applicant no longer \nassociates with drug-using friends or contacts and has relocated to a residence where \nshe lives alone and has complete control over the persons with whom she associates. \nNone of her current associates use illegal drugs. \nOverall, Applicant has worked hard to mitigate the security concerns raised by her \npast use of marijuana to relieve her chronic pain and mushrooms to manage her rare \nmoments of extreme crisis. She has carried her burden of persuasion and mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the above whole-person factors and the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, as well as the SecEA\u2019s Guidance, in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has fully mitigated her past drug use. Her \nrecent forthright disclosures of her history of drug use have minimized or eliminated the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress. It is unlikely that she will have any recurrence \nof similar drug use in the future. Overall, the record evidence does not raise any questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR) He also provided the following to Tax Company 3 about his rental \nproperty: \n2015-Income $9,673; maintenance contract $900; repair cost $224; \nmanagement fees $1,182 \n2016-Income $10,632; maintenance contract $900; repair cost $0; \nmanagement fees $1,182 \n2017-Income $10,361; maintenance contract $900; repair cost $635; \nmanagement fees $1,152 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant responded to the SOR in September 2022. He wrote that \u201c[a]ll \ndocumentation and tax organizers that are necessary to complete the tax years in \nquestion have been submitted to [Tax Company 3] for resolution.\u201d \nApplicant retained a fourth tax company (Tax Company 4) on June 16, 2023, to \nfile his back and current returns and negotiate any taxes owed. He agreed to pay the \ncompany $3,500, payable in seven monthly payments of $500, starting in June 2023. \nCompany 4 prepared and filed his 2022 federal income tax return. He owes about \n$7,000 for tax year 2022. He stated that he planned to pay the 2022 taxes in September \n2023. (Tr. at; 29-35; AE 7, 8, 10) \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax problems, and he stated that he was \nnot attempting to circumvent the tax laws, but there is no evidence that the tax returns \nfor 2014 through 2021 have been filed. He estimates that he owes the IRS about \n$25,000. He asserted that he fully intends to file the back returns and pay whatever \ntaxes are owed.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2014 through 2020 federal income tax returns when they \nwere due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues started in about 2013 when he was working overseas, and \nhe was evacuated to the United States for medical issues. He returned overseas about \neight months later, but after a few months, he had to be evacuated again to the United \nStates. He felt that he would catch up on the returns at a later date. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax problems, and he stated that he was \nnot attempting to circumvent the tax laws. He has gone through four tax companies, but \nhis returns have still not been filed, and he estimates that he owes the IRS about \n$25,000. He asserted that he fully intends to file the back returns and pay whatever \ntaxes are owed. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. His \nfailure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He claimed that \nin 2019, he resolved a credit card that was not listed in the SOR. The available \nevidence does not corroborate this resolution.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a number of delinquent debts, many of which are several years \nold. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. He has not \nprovided evidence that he has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by financial irresponsibility and \noverspending. These causes were not beyond his control. Even if they were, because \nhe has not attempted to resolve his debts, he has not shown that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances with respect to these debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. The \nlack of resolution of his SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence that any of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant defaulted on a mortgage loan and a consumer loan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his separation, pending divorce, \nand his wife\u2019s overspending. Those events were beyond his control. To receive the \nbenefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also prove that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant withdrew from his 401(k) and brought his mortgage loan current. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b is mitigated. He made no attempts to resolve the consumer loan on SOR \u00b6 1.a \nafter it was charged off, until the SOR spurred him into taking some action. An applicant \nwho begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his \nor her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. \n17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nApplicant and his wife entered into a mediated settlement agreement in May \n2023. The agreement provided that the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt would be \u201cnegotiated down as \nlow as possible and paid in full\u201d from the proceeds of the sale of their house. Applicant \nand the creditor agreed to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment of $7,148, to be paid \nno later than June 11, 2023. He testified that if the house is not sold, he would start \npaying $297 per month to the creditor until the house is sold. The creditor told him that \nthe settlement deal would still be available if he made those payments. The house \nnever sold, Applicant has never settled the debt, and he has not provided \ndocumentation of any payments. His intention to pay the debt in the future is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay the remaining SOR debt. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay \nthe debt. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable. None of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He stated that he was initially the driver, but \nhe switched with another worker, and he was a passenger when the co-worker had the \naccident. Applicant asserted that he did not report the accident because he felt it was \nthe co-worker\u2019s responsibility to report it. Applicant stated that his wife was only working \npart-time, and he was denied unemployment compensation because he was fired. \nDuring his unemployment, he could not pay all of his bills and several debts became \ndelinquent. (Items 3, 4, 8) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJanuary 2020. He did not report any unemployment in April or May 2018.

(Item 4) \nThe amended SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $23,480. \nApplicant owed all of the debts at one time, as established through his admissions and \ncredit reports. (Items 3-8; AE A) \nApplicant retained a law firm to assist him in managing his and his wife\u2019s debts. \nHe entered into payment agreements to pay the $3,666 and $366 debts owed to the \nsame collection company for the same bank. The original amount owed on the $3,066 \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) is unclear, but the March 2021 credit report listed the balance as \n$4,837. It was $3,066 by the January 2022 credit report, and it was listed with a $1,472 \nbalance in October 2022. Applicant stated that he is making $177 payments on the 15th  \nof every month.

(Items 3-8; AE A) I find that account \nhas been paid. \nApplicant stated that he paid the $105 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in November \n2022. He provided a reference number. Because credit reports corroborate his \nstatements about payments toward other debts, I find this debt is paid. (AE A) \nApplicant stated that he will address the $6,663 credit union debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nafter he finishes paying the smaller debt. (Item 3; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed in 2018 after he lost his job and was unable \nto maintain the payments on the auto loan. He stated that he asked the credit union that \nfinanced the loan to give him a few months until he found another job, but the credit \nunion was unwilling to work with him and repossessed the vehicle. The credit union \ncharged off $13,342 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), which was apparently the deficiency balance owed on \nthe loan after the vehicle was sold. He told a background investigator in April 2022 that \nhe missed about four payments before the vehicle was repossessed. He does not feel \nthat he should have to pay for a vehicle that he does not own. He stated that he will \ncontinue to dispute the account. (Items 3, 5-8; AE A) \nApplicant helps his daughter who lives in another state and has been unable to \nwork because of health reasons. He and his wife took in his wife\u2019s niece who was \nsexually abused by her father before he kicked her out of the house. Her father is in jail. \nApplicant stated that his family would be under tremendous stress if he lost his job. (AE \nA) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he has decided that he \nwill not pay the charged-off auto loan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to when he lost his job in 2018, and \nhis wife was only working part-time. He was fired because he failed to report that a \ncompany vehicle had been in an accident. That event was not beyond his control. It is \nalso unclear how long he was unemployed. The additional financial strain brought on by \nfinancially supporting his adult daughter and taking in his wife\u2019s niece were beyond his \ncontrol. I note that some financial problems predated the job loss. To Applicant\u2019s credit, \nhe resolved them in February 2017 when he refinanced his mortgage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant retained a law firm to assist him in managing his and his wife\u2019s debts. \nHe entered into payment agreements to pay the $3,666 and $366 debts before the SOR \nwas issued. The amount owed on those debts was more than reported on the SOR \nbecause he had already started paying them. The $366 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), originally at \nleast $1,192, has been paid. The $3,066 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), originally at least $4,837, is \nbeing paid through $177 monthly payments. The balance in October 2022 was $1,472. \nThe $105 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was paid in November 2022. Those three debts are \nmitigated. \nApplicant stated that he will address the $6,663 credit union debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nafter he finishes paying the smaller debt. There is no indication that he has any intention \nto pay the charged-off $13,342 auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He stated that he asked the \ncredit union to give him a few months until he found another job, but the credit union \nwas unwilling to work with him and repossessed the vehicle. However, he told the \nbackground investigator that he missed about four payments before the vehicle was \nrepossessed. That was at least a few months, and based upon the SF 86, it was longer \nthan he was unemployed. \nThis is a close case, but AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s \nremaining financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to \nfind that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith \neffort to pay the remaining debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to eliminate \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant\u2019s admission and evidence in the FORM establish he used and \npossessed marijuana from about April 1992 to January 2022, as alleged. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for approximately 30 years and to at least January 2022, \nwhen he was 46 years old. Although he was candid about his intended future use of \nmarijuana when asked on the SCA, I find his change of heart that he was \u201cunlikely\u201d to use \nmarijuana again during his background interview two months later to be far-fetched and \nself-serving. For Applicant to claim that he is no longer interested or motivated to use \nmarijuana is not convincing. Additionally, he has provided no evidence corroborating his \nclaims of abstinence, disassociation from persons who use drugs, or avoidance of \nenvironments where drugs are used. Because he requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred for a long period of time and a month \nbefore he completed his SCA. He was not a young, naive adult when he used marijuana. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for granting of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With a longer period of abstinence from substance misuse, he may be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

I received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 21, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has \nworked since August 2019. He earned a high school diploma in 2012. He is currently \ntaking undergraduate courses. He will earn an associate degree in December 2023 and \nis on track to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2024. He was married from 2014 until a \ndivorce in 2018. He has resided with a cohabitant since October 2019. He has three \nchildren, ages nine, six, and three. His two older children are from his marriage. He and \nhis cohabitant are the parents of his youngest child. He enlisted in the Army in 2013 and \nwas honorably discharged in 2017. He has held a security clearance since 2013. (Tr. \n18-21, 27-28, 35, 38-43; GE 1) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s seven delinquent financial \naccounts totaling approximately $32,000. It also alleged that he had a delinquent \nmortgage account that was foreclosed in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). These delinquent accounts \nconsist of a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.a), an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a medical debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), telecommunications debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g), and a cleaning fee from a \nresidential lease (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and \n1.d, but denied the rest because he claimed he had resolved those accounts. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. All the SOR allegations are established by \nhis admissions and the Government\u2019s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports. (Answer; \nGE 2-5) \nExcept for the foreclosed mortgage in SOR \u00b6 1.d, between 2022 and the \nbeginning of 2023, Applicant resolved all the accounts in the SOR. He fell behind on all \nthe SOR accounts in about 2018 because of his divorce, underemployment, and \nunemployment. He also had health issues that contributed to his financial issues and \nwas recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). In about 2022, after moving to a \nlocation with a lower cost of living, finding gainful employment, having his military \ndisability payment markedly increase, and after his divorce and child custody issues \nwere largely behind him, he contacted creditors for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c \nand 1.e through 1.g. He made payment arrangements with the creditors and satisfied \nthese debts. For the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, he paid approximately the full \nbalance. For the other SOR debts, he settled them for a reduced amount. I observed his \ndemeanor while he testified and found his testimony, including his statements about the \nresolution of his SOR debts, to be credible. He also provided documentary \ncorroboration of the resolution of some of these debts. (Tr. 18-21, 28-34, 40-45, 50-67; \nAnswer; GE 2-5) \nWith respect to his mortgage foreclosure in SOR \u00b6 1.d, when Applicant realized \nhe could not afford to make his monthly payments because of his divorce, he hired a \ncompany to advocate on his behalf with the mortgage company. However, this \ncompany\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful. He made the difficult decision to move to a \nlocation with a lower cost of living so he could pay for his family\u2019s basic needs and \nallowed the marital home mortgage to be foreclosed.

(Tr 47-50; Answer; GE 2-5) \nSince he started his current job, Applicant has earned about $72,500, annually. \nHe also receives about $2,600 in monthly military disability benefits. He has earned a \nbonus every year thus far at work. He and his cohabitant, who also works for a \ngovernment contractor, share household expenses. Since 2015, he has been a member \nof a self-improvement volunteer association. He takes college courses while working full \ntime, and coaches a high school wrestling team, for which he earns a stipend of $5,000, \nannually. While he was in the Army, he earned three Army achievement medals and \ntwo certificates of achievement. He testified that he is able to pay his bills on time and \nthat he had about $6,000 combined in his two checking accounts. He currently has no \ndelinquent financial accounts. (Tr. 27-28, 34-40, 62-63, 65-67) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s seven delinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately $32,000 \nwere delinquent for several years. In 2019, he also had a foreclosed mortgage account. \nThe above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s \ndelinquencies \nwere \ncaused \nby \ndivorce, \nunderemployment, \nunemployment, and health issues. These conditions were largely beyond his control. In \nresponse, he acted responsibly by contacting creditors, making payment arrangements, \nand complying with those arrangements. He also tried to work with the mortgage holder \nof his marital home before ultimately allowing the account to go to foreclosure, where \nthe sale of the marital home resolved the mortgage. He started making some of these \npayment arrangements prior to receiving the SOR. He contacted creditors after he had \nenough money to pay the SOR debts. He has provided sufficient evidence that his \nefforts to repay overdue creditors were made in good faith. Given his current financial \nsituation, including his income and savings, as well as the fact that he has no delinquent \ndebts, I find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 12, 2021. On October \n3, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 15, 2022, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He attached his earning\u2019s \nstatement from December 2022 to his SOR response. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on February 6, 2023, including Items 1 through 7. On the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsame date, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, \nwho was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on February 9, 2023, and \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2023. Items 1 through 7 are \nadmitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old machine operator employed by defense contractors \nsince February 2019. In 2022, Applicant\u2019s gross annual earnings exceeded $88,000, \ninclusive of company incentive pay totaling $14,000. Applicant is a participant in the \ncompany\u2019s 401(k) plan, having contributed over $6,000 pre-tax to the plan in 2022. (Item \n2 at 4). Prior to this position, Applicant worked as a construction laborer from March 2018 \nthrough February 2019; a self-employed Uber driver from June 2015 through March 2018; \nand a process engineer from June 2007 through June 2015. He states he left the position \nin June 2015 because the company moved its operations out-of-state. (Item 3 pp. 15 \nthrough 16) All told, Applicant has been consistently employed without any meaningful \ngap in employment since at least mid-2007. (Items 2 through 4) \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s education. (Items 3 \nthrough 4) He married the first time in 1996, but the marriage did not last and the couple \nparted ways in 1996. He married a second time in January 2009. The couple have two \nchildren, ages 13 and 10 years. He states his wife never worked outside of the family \nhome. (Items 3 through 4) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d and 1.e are duplicate accounts. The eight non-duplicate debts total about $30,306 \nand are reflected in credit bureau reports from July 2021 (Item 5) and April 2022 (Item 6). \nThese debts are established through these credit bureau reports; Applicant\u2019s admissions \nin his Response to the SOR; and his September 2021 investigative interview. (Items 2, \nand 4 through 6)\n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to medical debts incurred after the birth \nof his daughter in 2012. (Item 4 at 6) He stated other debts went unpaid due to him having \nto pay medical bills to the hospital that provided delivery services to his wife for the birth \nof his daughter. He states he did not have enough income to simultaneously support his \nfamily and pay his debts; and that he was the sole income-earner in the family, and his \nincome remained stagnant as the cost of living and other expenses increased over time. \nFinally, he states he used credit cards to pay bills during the period. (Items 2 and 4) He \nprovided no evidence or any details concerning his income or his general financial \nobligations during this period or afterwards, except his December 2022 earnings \nstatement attached to the Response to the SOR. (Items 2 and 4) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two largest delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are \ncharged-off credit cards from the same creditor, and total $19,353. Both accounts were \nassigned to collection; SOR \u00b6 1.a. was assigned in April 2014; and SOR \u00b6 1.b was \nassigned in April 2015. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2) The creditor charged off both accounts \nin about January 2018. A third delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $4,154 was \nassigned for collection in June 2015; it was charged off in about June 2021. (Item 5 at 3 \nand Item 6 at 2) Five remaining delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.f through \n1.i, were assigned to collection between July 2017 and July 2020. All five debts remain in \na collection status. (Items 5 and 6) \nAfter admitting responsibility for all delinquent debts in the SOR, Applicant loosely \nmade the following additional comment concerning the debts: \u201c[T]hey are deducting my \nwages from my paycheck already.\u201d (Item 2 at 2) He told investigators in September 2021, \nthat he would take the following actions concerning these debts to resolve them within \nthe next two years: (i) contact creditors to negotiate a monthly payment plan; or (ii) settle \nwith creditors to pay off debts; or (iii) contract with a third-party debt repayment company \nto consolidate all delinquent debts to pay off debts over time through monthly installments. \n(Item 4 pp. 7 through 8) There is no evidence in the record he took any of the \naforementioned actions. In the same interview, he commented that his current income is \nbetter and more stable, enabling him to financially support his family; he lives within his \nmeans; and does not foresee having delinquent debts in the future. (Item 4 at 8) \nApplicant\u2019s December 2022 earnings statement reflects an unidentified creditor\ngarnished his pay in the amount of $564.52 for an unidentified delinquent debt. The year-\nto-date garnishment totaled $1,776.31 during this period. His earnings statement also \nshows five loans collateralized against his 401(k) funds of an unknown total balance. \n(Item 2 at 4) No information was provided concerning the purpose of the five loans. Other \nthan the earnings statement discussed above, he provided no documentary proof of \nefforts or decisions taken to resolve delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 2 at 4) \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts in this \nSOR that remain outstanding. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant attributed his financial problems to \nmedical debts incurred related to the birth of his daughter in 2012, stating he was unable \nto pay other debts due to having to pay medical expenses; and, as the sole income-earner \nin the family, he was not earning enough to pay his bills on time and still support his family. \nIn 2012, Applicant had been working as a process engineer with the same employer since \n2007. He presented no information concerning his income at the time; nor did he present \ninformation concerning medical or hospital bills, or any other bills he was responsible for \npaying. He has not submitted evidence that he acted responsibly in the 10 years since \nhis daughter\u2019s birth. Moreover, there is no evidence he took the actions he informed \ninvestigators he would take in his September 2021 interview. There is no evidence he: (i) \ncontacted any creditors to negotiate a monthly payment plan; or (ii) settled any debts with \ncreditors; or (iii) that he contracted with a debt-settlement company. At least one creditor \nprevailed in garnishing his wages due to his non-payment of one or more delinquent \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant submitted no documentary \nevidence of financial counseling, contacts with creditors, payments, payment plans, or \nother evidence of efforts to resolve his debts. He presented his December 2022 earnings \nstatement that showed an unidentified creditor garnished his wages for an unidentified \ndelinquent debt. A court-mandated or an otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution \nsuch as garnishment is entitled to less weight than efforts initiated and carried out by a \ndebtor; that is, reliance upon garnishment does not equate to good-faith efforts by \nApplicant to resolve his financial problems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jul. 7, 2016). Applicant gets minimal credit for debts addressed by a creditor\u2019s \ngarnishment action. However, there is inadequate information regarding the garnishment \ncreditor and the relevant debt to award any credit here. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

All exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nOctober 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. Her admissions have been \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. She is not \nmarried and has no children. She was in a cohabitational relationship from 2004 until \napproximately 2019. She has been employed by her present employer since November \n2021. When she began this employment, she earned $110,000 per year, and it increased \nincrementally, and she now earns $115,000 per year as of July 2023. (Tr. 23-25, 30) \nApplicant completed a National Security Questionnaire (SF 86) in June 2021. She \nreported a period of unemployment from November 2019 to March 2020. She had been \nemployed from May 2019 to November 2019 and reported on her SF 86: \u201cLeft by mutual \nagreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. I was not happy about traveling \nfor my position.\u201d She testified that she voluntarily left this job because she did not want to \nget a corporate credit card, which was required for travel. She did not have another job \nlined up before she left this employment. She secured a job in March 2020, with Company \nA and earning about $98,000. (Tr. 23-30; GE 1, 2) \nIn December 2020, Applicant left the employment of Company A for a job that paid \na higher salary. She began employment with Company B. In August 2021, she was \nterminated from her job at Company B for breach of contract due to various infractions. \nShe testified that she was aware of the termination but disputed some of the reasons. \nShe admitted to receiving verbal reprimands. She further testified that she does not \ndispute that she was terminated from her job at Company B, but she said she was also \ntold she could apply for another job within the company. She testified that she was \nunemployed for a few weeks and then started a job with another company and worked \nthere from September 2021 through October 2021, prior to starting her present job in \nNovember 2021. (Tr. 23-30, 57, 60-64; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2021. She \ndisclosed to the investigator that she no longer worked at Company B and had left the job \nfor better opportunities, pay and benefits. She did not disclose she was terminated from \nthe job. (GE 2) \nIn January 2022, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator. \nShe was presented with an opportunity to discuss and confirm her employment history. \nShe confirmed that in the last seven years she had not been fired from a job, quit a job \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafter being told she would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of \nmisconduct or following notice of unsatisfactory performance, received a written warning, \nbeen reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace at any of \nher employments. She did not disclose her termination from Company B. She was \nconfronted by the investigator with her August 2021 termination and she explained that \nshe did not report this information when interviewed in September 2021 because she was \nembarrassed. She previously said she left Company B on good terms. She was \nconfronted by the investigator with the various infractions, and she admitted most of them \nat that time. During her hearing, she clarified, explained, or disputed some of the \ninfractions. She said she is embarrassed about her behavior during this time. She \nadmitted she was untruthful. (Tr. 30, 37, 39-40, 64-72; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that during this time, she was going through relationship \nproblems that began in 2018, and she was struggling emotionally. She was working \nremotely due to the pandemic, and she was having difficulty adjusting. She admitted she \ndid not handle herself very well, and it impacted her work. She testified that she was \naware of her duty to disclose that she was terminated from employment with Company B \nwhen she was asked about it. She deliberately falsified material facts during her \ninterviews with a government investigator. (Tr. 30, 37, 39, 64-72; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that her personal issues with her partner impacted her life and \nher work. At the time, she was trying to save her relationship and put her life back \ntogether. She quit one job and was not performing well at another. When she quit her job, \nher only income was unemployment benefits, which were insufficient for her to pay her \nbills. She testified that her debts became delinquent in approximately November 2019, \nwhen she stopped making payments. She and her partner separated around 2019. She \ndid not reach out to any of her creditors when she stopped paying her accounts in 2019. \n(Tr. 30-31, 37, 42-43) \nApplicant testified that she pays her ex-partner\u2019s monthly car payment of \napproximately $416 and many of her living expenses. Her ex-partner worked sporadically \nand occasionally contributed to the household expenses throughout their relationship \nwhich began about 2004, but Applicant was primarily responsible for the household \nexpenses. Applicant purchased a house in 2005 and was solely responsible for paying \nthe mortgage. In August 2021, she sold the house so she could give her ex-partner the \nprofit of approximately $42,000. When questioned why she gave the entire profit to her \nex-partner when she had delinquent debts, she said it was because she had made a \nverbal agreement with her to give her the money because she had been unfaithful to her. \n(Tr. 37, 49-54, 75-85) \nDuring the pandemic, Applicant\u2019s partner drove her car to a distant state. Applicant \nwent to pick her up and they left the vehicle there. They decided not to retrieve it for about \n11 months because at the time there were certain border restrictions due to the pandemic. \nApplicant rented a car for her ex-partner from about February 2020 until December 2020 \nwhen they retrieved the other vehicle. She estimated the monthly cost of the vehicle was \napproximately $600-$700. This impacted her ability to pay her other debts.

She said no because other things were \ngoing on in her personal life. She and her partner were trying to figure out how to separate, \nwhich they are still trying to do. (Tr. 37. 44-49) \nApplicant lives in a hotel with her dog. Her ex-partner also lives in the same hotel. \nApplicant pays for both hotel rooms, and they have lived there for about two years. She \ntestified that she pays about $3,200 a month for the two rooms. When asked why she did \nnot rent an apartment, she explained it was unaffordable with the extra deposits and \nstartup costs of getting an apartment. She stated that despite the fact she and her ex-\npartner have been separated for an extended period, she continues to financially support \nher. She said her ex-partner has some medical issues. She is not on disability. Her ex-\npartner shares the expenses for the dog. (Tr. 37, 49-57) \nApplicant testified that she has no savings or money in her accounts. After paying \nall her living expenses and some of her ex-partners, she has about $100 left. She does \nnot have investments. She said she withdrew the money she had in an individual \nretirement account years ago. She has not participated in financial counseling in the past \nten years but had some before then. (Tr. 54-56) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,207. Applicant \nsettled the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,714) in May 2023 for $1,085, after receiving \nthe SOR. She provided documentary proof of the settlement. (Tr. 31-33; GE 3, 4, 5; AE \nA). \nIn May 2023, Applicant contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($8,927) \nand made a payment arrangement to make monthly payments of $483 to settle the debt \nfor $5,800. She has made the required payments to date. (Tr. 31, 35-36; GE 3, 4, 5; AE \nH) \nApplicant has not contacted the creditors or resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a ($2,112); 1.b ($8,978); 1.c ($1,056); and 1.f ($2,714). She admitted that she was \nirresponsible when she quit her job in 2019 without first having a plan or job in place. \nThese debts have been delinquent since late 2019. She stated that she still has two more \npayments on her partner\u2019s car to pay and that will free up money, and then she will be \nable to begin to address her remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 36-37; GE 2, 3, 4, 5)  \nApplicant testified that she failed to have sufficient tax withholdings taken during \ntax year 2021 and ended up owing about $3,200 in taxes to the IRS. After completion of \nher tax returns and becoming aware of her debt, she contacted the IRS and entered into \nan installment agreement to pay $85 a month for three years. She is current on her \npayments. She owed taxes for 2022 ($1,600) and paid them. These payments have \nimpacted her ability to make payments towards her delinquent debts.

(Tr. 60-70, 74; AE F, G, I, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersona, professional, or community standing . . .. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was terminated from her employment in \nAugust 2021 due to breach of contract and violations and infractions of various company \npolicies. She admitted some of the infractions and disputed others. She admitted she \nreceived verbal reprimands from her supervisor. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts during her \ninterview with a government investigator in September 2021 by stating she left her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployment with Company B in August 2021 for a better opportunity, on good terms, and \nwithout any issues. This was not true as she had been terminated as explained in the \nabove paragraph. She was deliberately untruthful. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant falsified material facts during her interview \nwith a government investigator in January 2022 by confirming that in the last seven years \nshe had not been fired from a job, quit after being told she would be fired, left by mutual \nagreement following allegations of misconduct or notice of unsatisfactory performance, \nreceived a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace. She had in fact been terminated from her employment with \nCompany B as explained in the above paragraph. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not disclose her termination from Company B during her September \n2021 interview. Later in January 2022, she was interviewed a second time and was asked \nif in the last seven years if she had been terminated from a job, and she denied she had \nbeen. After she was confronted with the information by the investigator, she disclosed the \ntermination and circumstances. She said she was embarrassed. Her deliberate \nfalsifications are not minor, and cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s infractions and violations of company policy culminated in her \ntermination, they were mostly minor. I considered that she was going through personal \nproblems at the time and was having difficulty adjusting to working remotely due to the \npandemic. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debts when she quit her job in 2019. She \ndid not have another job lined up when she quit and was unable to pay her debts. \nApplicant made choices about her finances. She chose to give the profits of the sale of \nher house to her ex-partner and live in a hotel for two years, and not address any of her \ndelinquent debts until after receiving the SOR. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of her quitting her job in 2019 and \nthen being unemployed and unable to pay her bills. Her financial problems were \nexacerbated by the choices she made in how she spent her money. She sold her house \nand had a $42,000 profit that she gave to her ex-partner. She chooses to live in a hotel \nbecause she said she cannot afford the deposits for a rental unit. Although she and her \nex-partner are no longer together, Applicant pays most of her expenses. These are not \nconditions that are beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. She has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has resolved or is resolving the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. She did not begin to address these debts until after \nshe received the SOR. Waiting until a security clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts may show an applicant may be lacking in judgment expected of those having \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nShe has not addressed her other delinquent debts because she is paying a tax liability \nand does not currently have the resources. She has not had financial counseling in over \nten years. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application as there are \nnot clear indications that her financial problems are under control. Despite some \nmitigation, it is insufficient to mitigate the financial conditions security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe government must be confident that those holding security clearances comply \nwith rules and regulations, even when they are inconvenient, tedious, or when no one is \nwatching. Being able to rely on those with security clearances to use good judgment and \nbe honest is the cornerstone of the process. Applicant also has an unreliable financial \ntrack record. She has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 2.b-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has an employment offer \nfrom a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security \nclearance eligibility. He anticipates that if he begins working for this contractor, he will \nbe living and working in Iraq. He was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from an Iraqi university. Applicant first came to the U.S in 2013 as a refugee. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2018. He holds both U.S. and Iraqi \ncitizenships. He has never married and has no children. (Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 34; GE 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), sister (SOR \u00b6 1.b), brother (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and \nseveral friends are citizens and residents of Iraq.

He also holds a similar \ninheritance right in the parcel of land owned by his mother. In about May 2022, he told \nan Army investigator that he did not want to renounce his Iraqi citizenship because he \nwanted to protect his potential ownership rights in the real property in Iraq titled in his \nfather\u2019s name (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

She now receives the equivalent of social \nsecurity income from the Iraqi government. Applicant provided his mother and sister \nabout $300 to $400 in support a few times per year until about 2019. He testified that he \nno longer sends money to his mother and sister because he cannot afford to do so. He \nmaintains contact with his mother nearly every day via video chat. He last saw her in \nperson in Iraq in February 2022. (Tr. 43-48, 50-52; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has contact with his sister four-to-five times per week via video chat. \nShe is a homemaker and has never worked outside the home.

Prior to his arrival in the U.S., Applicant worked for a non-governmental \norganization (NGO) in Iraq. Since arriving in the U.S. in 2013, he has worked in the U.S \nas a delivery driver, a driver for a U.S. based corporation providing ride-hailing services, \nand as a technician for a contractor of an internet company. He currently earns about \n$4,000 per month. He has about $4,000 in a U.S. based bank account and about \n$2,000 invested in U.S. based stocks. He owns a car in the U.S. (Tr. 30-38, 47-48, 52-\n64; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant has friends who reside in the U.S., but none of his family members \nreside here. None of his family members hold U.S. citizenship or U.S. residency rights, \nand none of them have visited the U.S. Applicant owns no real property in the U.S.  He \nclaimed his family does not know that he is trying to obtain security clearance eligibility, \nor that he may be working in Iraq. He claimed he will not tell them if he does obtain \nsecurity clearance eligibility. He expressed his loyalty to the United States. He testified \nthat his family in Afghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. 30-\n38, 47-48, 52-64; GE 1-3) \nSince he arrived in the U.S. in 2013, Applicant visited Iraq in 2017 and 2021 to \n2022. He stayed in Iraq for about three months in 2017 and for about 14 months in \n2021. He stayed in the house titled in his father\u2019s name with his mother and brother \nwhen he visited. He had in-person contact with his family members and friends during \nthese visits. (Tr. 50-61; GE 1-3) \nIn HE 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of March 2023, about the United States' relations with Iraq and the current conditions \nin that country. I take administrative notice of the information included in those \ndocuments including, but not limited to: \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and \nlimited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and \nWestern companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \noccur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and \nstrikes occur frequently. These events can develop quickly without prior notification, \noften interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the \npotential to turn violent. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia-\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through 2022, with reports of more \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured.

ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible \nreports of unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances \nby the government; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the \ngovernment; and arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant's family members and foreign contacts are vulnerable to \ncoercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or \nfriend is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence collection operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe administratively noticed country conditions in Iraq, such as terrorism, civil unrest, \nand its human-rights record, raise the security concerns to the level of a heightened \nrisk. \nApplicant's mother, two siblings, and a friend with whom he maintains close and \ncontinuing contact, are citizens and residents of Iraq. One of his siblings and the friend \nhave a job that is connected to the Iraqi government. Applicant's connection to his Iraqi \nfamily members and friend presents a potential conflict of interest. As a matter of \ncommon sense and human experience there is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, their immediate family members and \nlongstanding friends. Application of the AG is not a comment on an applicant's \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family \nmember. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant co-owns a piece of real property in Iraq that has \na value of about a $600,000. While he may have inheritance rights in this property that \nare relevant to mitigation, the record evidence demonstrates that he does not own the \nreal property. I therefore find SOR \u00b6 1.e for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAt the outset, I find that Applicant\u2019s contact with his friend who is a teacher in Iraq \nis so casual that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. I find he has mitigated the security concerns with respect to the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nCountry conditions in Iraq raise security concerns to the level of a heightened \nrisk. Applicant has several immediate family members in Iraq with whom he maintains \nclose and frequent contact. He also has a significant number of extended family in Iraq. \nTwo of his family members are reliant on the Iraqi Government for income. While he \ndoes not currently own any property in Iraq, his potential future inheritance rights involve \nsubstantial property interests there. He has shown an interest in protecting his potential \nfuture ownership rights in these properties. He has lived about 75 percent of his life in \nIraq. He has no family who are citizens of the United States and no family who reside \nhere. While he owns a car, has small investments, and a job in the U.S., he owns no \nreal property here. The value of his U.S. based property is not significant when \ncompared to his potential property rights in Iraq. I find that he has failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the concerns about foreign preference stating: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S.\nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the\nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not\ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at\nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or\nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law.   \nThe Government alleges that Applicant used his Iraqi citizenship to protect his \nfinancial interests in Iraq. He may be using his Iraqi citizenship to protect his inheritance \ninterest in Iraqi real property because at one time, he did not want to renounce his Iraqi \ncitizenship to keep that potential interest. However, there is no evidence in the record \nthat this action violates U.S. law. I find the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 10(e) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B and Guideline C in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The foreign preference security \nconcerns were not established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nSubparagraph 1.d-1.e: \nParagraph 2, Guideline C: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He attended a university from 2001 to 2004 and April \nto October 2017. (Tr. 22) His student loans were borrowed to fund his 2001 to 2004 \nuniversity attendance. (Tr. 29) He made some payments on his student loans starting \nshortly after graduation until about 2013. (Tr. 30-31) He stopped making payments around \n2013 when he was getting divorced and became unemployed. (Tr. 32, 42) Around 2013 \nor 2015, the creditor advised him that he could rehabilitate his student-loan debt if he \nmade consistent payments for six months. (Tr. 33) In 2017, he made an effort to find out \nthe creditor holding his student loans; however, he was unsuccessful. (Tr. 34) In 2019, \nhe learned DoED held his student loans. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant said he applied for the federal loan forgiveness program. (HE 3) In \nFebruary 2020, his loans were placed into forbearance and interest on his loans was \nstopped. (Id.) In August 2022, he applied for the loan rehabilitation and consolidation \nprogram. (Tr. 37-38; HE 3) He believes he has been approved for the DoED income \ndriven repayment plan.

(Tr. 53) He and his former spouse both took the deductions for their \nchildren, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) credited the deductions to his former \nspouse.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating\nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He had periods of \nunemployment and three divorces, and he has made some progress addressing his \ndebts. He has initiated a payment plan to address his student loans, and DoED moved \nthem out of default into good standing status.

A \ncomponent is whether he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate \npartial payments to keep debts current. Applicant provided limited supporting \ndocumentation that he initiated or maintained contact with several creditors. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicants are not required \u201cto \nbe debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance.

There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on \nall delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in \nthe SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts may be dropped from \na credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a \ncreditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or \nwhen the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant\u2019s child-support debts are being paid through garnishment. Applicant may \nnot have understood the distinction between involuntary income withholding orders (IWO) \nand involuntary payments through garnishment. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd.

He did not provide documentation from the IRS showing \nhis tax debt was in an IRS approved payment plan. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant took some actions to bring his student loans to current \nstatus and start a payment plan in 2023 after the SOR was issued.

However, the Appeal Board clarified that even in instances \nwhere an applicant has purportedly corrected his or her financial problem, and the fact \nthat applicant is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude \ncareful consideration of applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. \nJune 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of \nconduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support \napproval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns \nafter receipt of the SOR). \nUnder all the circumstances, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old engineering communications specialist. He has worked \nfor his current employer since June of 2023. In 2004, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncomputer information science. From 2017 to present, he worked for seven different \nemployers. He provided a resume detailing his professional experience. He honorably \nserved in the Navy from 1987 to 1994. He was discharged from the Navy as a petty officer \nsecond class. He provided some important mitigating information, which is discussed in \nthe financial considerations mitigation analysis section, supra. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time \nthan the evidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to establish \na payment plan to address his federal income tax debt of about $5,000 and his student \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nloan debts.

See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

(Tr. 12-13) I held the record open \nuntil December 23, 2022, to afford Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \nevidence. (Tr. 74-75) Applicant did not submit any post-hearing documents. On \nDecember 20, 2022, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 48-year-old sheet metal mechanic work lead, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2019. He is a first-time applicant for \nsecurity clearance. Successfully vetting for a clearance is a requirement of his \ncontinued employment. His employer has given him until January 24, 2023 to have his \nclearance issues resolved or face termination. (Tr. 13-18; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1992. He was awarded a Bachelor of \nScience degree in business administration in 1996. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) He married in \n2007, and has two children, a 14-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter. His wife is \nemployed full-time as an assembler in the private sector. (Tr. 20-22) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists nine allegations under this concern. These allegations are \nestablished by his July 16, 2019 SF-86; his September 23, 2019 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) Personal Subject Interview (PSI); his September 1, 2022 SOR \nAnswer; his August 6, 2019, February 6, 2020, May 20, 2022, and October 26, 2022 \ncredit reports; his July 16, 2022 Response to Interrogatories; and his hearing testimony. \n(GE 1 through 7; SOR Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when his father passed away in 2002, and \nhis mother passed away two years later in 2004. Applicant is one of three children from \na traditional Vietnamese family. The three children split the costs of their parents\u2019 \nfunerals with each contributing $10,000 for their mother\u2019s funeral expenses, and each \ncontributing $15,000 for their father\u2019s funeral expenses. Additionally, the family incurred \nthe further expense to reinter their father next to their mother\u2019s gravesite. (Tr. 22-26) \nApplicant charged his portion of his parents\u2019 funeral costs to his credit cards. (Tr. 26) \nA coworker suggested that Applicant consolidate his credit card debt, which he \ndid with a $25,000 consolidation loan in 2011. (Tr. 26) However, shortly after he took \nout the consolidation loan, he was unemployed and was required to use consolidation \nloan funds to meet living expenses for his family. (Tr. 26) Applicant reported several \nperiods of unemployment on his SF-86: June 2018 to January 2019; September 2015 to \nJune 2016; September 2011 to September 2012; and February 2010 to July 2010. (Tr. \n27-28; GE 1) Applicant drew unemployment compensation during those periods of \nunemployment and his wife continued to work; however, he was never able to recover \nfrom the income shortfalls from his loss of employment. (Tr. 28-29) In short, the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunplanned expenses for the funerals of both of his parents within a two-year period, and \nfour periods of unemployment were circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. 29) \nUp until 2019, Applicant was current on his bills, but he was carrying significant \ndebt. (Tr. 34-35) In 2019, before he started his current job, he consulted a debt relief \ncompany (DRC) that advised him to stop paying his debts. Their counsel was that when \nhis debts became delinquent, the DRC could negotiate settlements with his various \ncreditors. However, shortly after discussing a recovery plan with the DRC, Applicant\u2019s \nwife was laid off due to Covid, and he was unable to afford the DRC monthly payments. \n(Tr. 39-40) \nOn July 16, 2022, Applicant entered into a 44-month plan with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC), approximately one month before his August 24, 2022 \nSOR was issued. He pays $393 by direct debit to the DCC on the 15th  and 30th  of each \nmonth.  He provided documentation of making timely payments to the DCC. The DCC \nuses these funds to pay off and/or settle his enrolled debts. (Tr. 38-39; AE C-1, AE C-2, \nAE C-3, AE C-4, AE C-5, AE C-6) Later, on November 9, 2022, Applicant signed an \nagreement with a law firm (LF) to resolve three of his SOR debts that evolved into civil \nlawsuits. (AE B-2, AE B-3) The applicability of these agreements are discussed further \nbelow. \nThe following is a summary of Applicant\u2019s nine SOR allegations and their status: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Charged-off credit card account for iPhone promotion in the \namount of $3,602. This debt is enrolled with the DCC and will be settled and/or paid as \nfunds become available. (Tr. 33-34, 36-38; AE C-2) DEBT BEING RESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Charged-off credit card account in the amount of $10,929. This \ncreditor obtained a judgment against Applicant. Applicant retained the services of LF to \nresolve this debt. The LF stated in a letter dated December 7, 2022 that their office is \nworking to amicably resolve with debt with a payment plan such that upon final \npayment, a satisfaction of judgment will be filed with the court. (Tr. 41-4; AE B-1, AE C-\n2) DEBT BEING RESOLVED.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Charged-off credit card account in the amount of $12,661. \nApplicant used this credit card to pay for his parents\u2019 funeral. This debt is enrolled with \nthe DCC and will be settled and/or paid as funds become available. (Tr. 47-53; AE C-2) \nDEBT BEING RESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Collection consolidation loan in the amount of $10, 949. This is\nthe consolidation loan referred to above. Applicant retained the services of LF to \n \n resolve \nthis debt. The LF stated in a letter dated December 7, 2022 that their office currently \nhas a deadline to amicably resolve this matter by January 30, 2023 and expects that \nupon settlement, and payment, that the creditor will file a dismissal with prejudice.

(Tr. 56-57; GE 3; AE C-2) DEBT BEING \nRESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \u2013 Charged-off credit card account in the amount of $9,677. \nApplicant retained the services of LF to resolve this debt. The LF stated, in a letter \ndated December 7, 2022, that their office currently has a deadline to amicably resolve \nthis matter by January 30, 2023, and expects that, upon settlement and payment, the \ncreditor will file a dismissal with prejudice. [Note \u2013 this is the same creditor as in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d.] (Tr. 57-60; AE B-1, AE C-2) DEBT BEING RESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h \u2013 Charged-off credit card account n the amount of $3,264. (Tr. 60\u00ad\n62; SOR Answer) Applicant submitted documentation that this account was \u201csettled in \nfull\u201d on July 16, 2021. (Tr. 60-62; SOR Answer) DEBT RESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6- 1.i \u2013 Collection credit card account in the amount of $7,941. \nApplicant retained the services of LF to resolve this debt. The LF stated, in a letter \ndated December 7, 2022, that their office currently has a deadline to amicably resolve \nthis matter by February 2, 2023, and expects that, upon settlement and payment, the \ncreditor will file a dismissal with prejudice. (Tr. 62-64; AE B-1, AE C-2) DEBT BEING \nRESOLVED. \nAs noted above, two out of the nine accounts are resolved, and Applicant has a \nplan in place to resolve the remaining debts. Applicant is paid at a rate of $40 an hour, \nand estimates his annual salary to be in the range of $70,000 to $80,000. His wife\u2019s \nannual salary is approximately $36,000. He owns his home, valued at $700,000, and he \nowes approximately $330,000 on his mortgage. Applicant drives a 2006 Honda Pilot \nand his wife drives a 2003 Honda Accord. The liens on both vehicles are paid. (Tr. 29-\n32) Applicant sought financial counseling through his DCC, and he prepared a budget \nfor DCC when he signed up for their service on July 16, 2022. Applicant\u2019s combined \nmonthly income is $6,688, his total monthly expenses are $5,848, his monthly deposit to \nDCC is $786, and his net monthly remainder is $54. (Tr. 32, 65-65; GE 7; AE C-1)  \nBefore Applicant encountered his current financial difficulties, his credit score \nwas in the 800 range. He currently has one credit card and only uses that when \npayment is required by credit card. He is committed to becoming debt free. This entire \nexperience has been very stressful for his family and himself. He is not interested in \nfiling bankruptcy because these debts are his and he wants to do what is right by paying \nthem off. (Tr. 66-67) Applicant\u2019s \u201cbiggest goal\u201d is to pay his debts and get his security \nclearance. He does not want to go through this process the next time his security \nclearance comes up for renewal.

The authors of his reference \nletters enthusiastically support his application for a security clearance. (Tr. 69-72; AE A-\n1 \u2013 A-6)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) are fully applicable. The funeral expenses \nassociated with the passing of Applicant\u2019s parents, and four periods of unemployment \nfor himself and one period of unemployment for his wife, were all circumstances beyond \nhis control. Applicant sought financial counseling with his DCC, and he is diligently \nmaking monthly payments to the DCC to underwrite the costs of settling his delinquent \ndebts. He has paid off two of his SOR debts. He has retained LF to address the three \ncreditors who have filed judgments against him. Applicant has demonstrated through his \nactions that he is determined to overcome his indebtedness.

Given his available financial resources, the \nrecords support the fact that he is doing his best to pay off the creditors. The Appeal \nBoard has established the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as \nthis: \nan applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations \nomitted). \nWhen taking into account Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view his corrective \nefforts to be reasonable and responsible. He paid off two of his nine SOR debts and has \na plan in place to resolve his remaining seven debts. Given the progress Applicant had \nmade and continues to make, he should be debt-free before his 44-month agreement \nwith the DCC expires. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated into this whole-person section. However, \nfurther comments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. \nTo review, Applicant is a 48-year-old sheet metal mechanic work lead, who has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since August 2019. He fell into debt after a \nseries of events beyond his control, and has taken reasonable and measured steps to \nregain financial responsibility. He recognized the importance of regaining financial \nresponsibility, not only for purposes of obtaining a clearance, but also going forward as \na productive member of society. He accepts responsibility for his debts and is \ncommitted to doing the right thing by his creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s approach to resolving his debts is measured and responsible. I was \nimpressed with his demeanor and sincerity. It is clear from his actions that he is \ndetermined to regain financial responsibility. He is well regarded by his employer. He \nand his spouse have jobs that will provide them with the income to repay their creditors. \nApplicant understands what he needs to do to maintain financial responsibility. His \nefforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayment. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. National security eligibility is granted. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(GX 8 at 48) He actively \nparticipated in the group therapy sessions. The group therapy records reflect that \nApplicant was admonished frequently to follow medication instructions and advised him \nagainst premature tapering off the use of drugs to control the craving for opioids. (GX 8 \nat 82) At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he stopped taking the drugs sooner than his \ntherapist recommended and contrary to the advice of his peer support group. He \nconsiders himself \u201ccompletely clean.\u201d (Tr. 32) The records of the group therapy facility do \nnot include a prognosis. \nIn June 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a board-certified psychologist at the \nrequest of the DCSA CAS. (GX 4) The psychologist had him complete a personality \nassessment inventory (PAI). The psychologist noted that Applicant responded to items \ncarelessly and did not pay attention to the content of the questions. He attributed \nApplicant\u2019s answers in the PAI were due to \u201cgeneral carelessness, reading problems, \nattention problems, or idiosyncratic thinking.\u201d The psychologist concluded that the PAI \nwas invalid because Applicant\u2019s responses to questions were \u201cindicative of respondents \nwho attempt to portray themselves in the most positive light and exceptionally free of the \ncommon shortcomings to which most others will admit.\u201d \nThe psychologist also noted that Applicant \u201cwas not highly motivated to put forth \nthe mental energy needed to provide a detailed accounting of his mental health and \nsubstance us history and treatment history.\u201d Instead, Applicant simply referred to his SCA \nand report of investigation multiple times as the source of information that the \npsychologist asked for. \nApplicant told the psychologist that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired \nby his current employer in September 2020, but later in the interview he admitted that he \nhad \u201csmoked weed here and there\u201d since he was hired. (GX 4 at 4) He admitted to the \npsychologist that he stopped taking the opioid-withdrawal drugs sooner than his therapist \nrecommended and contrary to the advice of his peer support group. The psychologist \nreported that it was difficult to fully understand Applicant\u2019s current substance-abuse \nstatus, because the information he provided during the assessment was inconsistent with \npast records (such as his SCA and responses to interrogatories) and his own statements \nduring the assessment. He noted that there was \u201chard evidence\u201d that Applicant had \nrecovered from his last episode of opioid abuse, but there was also evidence that he did \nnot follow the treatment recommendations from his last treatment that ended in December \n2018. The psychologist concluded: \nAt best, [Applicant] has abstained from opioid and other drug use since 2017 \nand from marijuana use since 2020.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline except SOR \u00b6 1.g, \nalleging use of PCP, which he denied. There is no evidence showing that he knowingly \nused PCP. Therefore, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.g in his favor. His admissions and the \nevidence submitted at the hearing establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h and 1.h-1.l, and are sufficient \nto establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder. \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 25(e) (\u201cfailure to successfully complete a drug \ntreatment program prescribed by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional\u201d) \nis relevant and established by the evidence that he failed to complete his treatment \nprogram in August 2013, but it was not alleged in the SOR.

Because his failure to do so is not alleged in the SOR, I have considered \nthe unalleged conduct it for the limited purposes set out above. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s conditions are treatable, but he has not \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his most recent treatment plan. \nContrary to the recommendation of a psychiatric nurse practitioner and his group therapy \npeer group, he accelerated his use of opioid-withdrawal drugs and terminated his use of \nthem prematurely. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c), 29(d), and 29(e) are not established. The psychologist who \nconducted the mental health evaluation for the CAS was unable to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s condition was under control or in remission. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l and 2.a-2.d (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a). In addition, it alleges that Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct in \nDecember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.b), charged with assault and battery in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.c), charged with assault and battery in March 2012 (SOR \u00b6 3.d), charged with \ndestruction of property (SOR \u00b6 3.e), charged with failure to appear in February 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 3.f), and charged with contempt of court (SOR \u00b6 3.g). \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to disclose material facts in his April \n2019 SCA (SOR \u00b6 3.h), failed to disclose material facts in his responses to interrogatories \nin September 2022 (SOR \u00b6 3.i), and failed to disclose material facts during his \npsychological evaluation in June 2022 (SOR \u00b6 3.j). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate.

He also admitted \nthat in his responses to interrogatories, he did not disclose his use of Oxycontin and \nmarijuana more extensively than he admitted. He explained that he was young, not in a \nsober mindset, and did not know what drugs were in his system when he was tested. \nHowever, his admissions to the Guideline H allegations establish that he knew what he \nhad used. \nThe psychologist\u2019s observations about Applicant\u2019s carelessness and inattention to \nthe questions in the PAI suggest that the same carelessness may have contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s incomplete answers to the questions in the SCA and the interrogatories. On \nthe other hand, the psychologist also noted Applicant\u2019s tendency to answer questions in \nthe light most favorable to him, which suggests that Applicant was trying to minimize his \nculpability when he submitted his SCA and answered the DOHA interrogatories. \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant intentionally skewed the results of the \nPAI. His report does not recite any specific inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s medical \nrecords and the information that he provided during the psychological evaluation. He \nreported that Applicant seemed ill-prepared to discuss his medical history in detail and \nwas sometimes evasive about it. He noted that Applicant responded to questions by \nreferring to his answers in the SCA, which were false. He specifically noted that Applicant \ntold him that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired by his current employer in \nSeptember 2020 but later admitted using marijuana after he was hired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established for Applicant\u2019s omissions from his SCA and DOHA \ninterrogatories. Applicant made no attempt to correct his SCA or his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories until he was confronted with the evidence. However, AG \u00b6 17(a) is \nestablished for his claim during his psychological evaluation that he stopped using \nmarijuana in September, which he promptly corrected later in the interview. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Falsification during a security-clearance adjudication \nis not \u201cminor.\u201d It is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of the security clearance \nadjudication process. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, I, and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his drug involvement, psychological conditions, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I, (Psychological Conditions ): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1). On December 12, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

(Tr. 25) After a brief discussion, \nthe technical sergeant told Applicant, who was a senior airman (E-4), to come into the \noffice. (Tr. 25) Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, a staff sergeant (E-5) was in the office \nas an observer. (Tr. 27) Once they were in the office, the argument became heated, and \nApplicant threatened to \u201ctake his supervisor out now.\u201d (Tr. 23-24, 27) Applicant said he \nwas inconsolable; however, he did not actually intend to kill his supervisor. (Tr. 28) His \nsupervisor suggested that he obtain counseling. (Tr. 30) He received counseling, and he \nwas prescribed Wellbutrin for anxiety. (Tr. 33-34) He took Wellbutrin for about two \nmonths. (Tr. 33-34) He had side effects, including headaches, and he had another \noutburst in the middle of a physical training session. (Tr. 34) He was advised to stop taking \nit. (Tr. 30, 34) He was not prescribed anything to replace the Wellbutrin. (Tr. 35) He \nattended counseling twice a month for about three months. (Tr. 33) During his follow-up \ntreatment, he was possibly diagnosed with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. (Tr. 31) \nIn March 2010, Applicant was assigned to an Air Force base in the United States, \nand he was scheduled to deploy overseas. (Tr. 37-38) He was worried that he might have \na nervous breakdown if he was around the wrong people, and he advised his command \nthat he may have problems if he is deployed.

(GE 3 \nat 5) \nApplicant disagreed with Rule Out Major Depressive Disorder and Rule Out \nPsychotic Disorder because those diagnoses were preliminary and not established.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d) are established. The disqualifying conditions \nwill be discussed in the mitigating conditions section, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nIn about 2004, Applicant was referred for mental-health treatment after he told his \nAir Force supervisor that he thought about killing him and that he should have killed him \nor words to that effect. He has subsequently had occasional angry outbursts; however, \nthe ones after 2004 were not as significant and did not involve threats. His outbursts are \nsufficient to establish AG \u00b6 28(a) by history; however, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are mitigated \nbecause there is no indication of a current problem with angry outbursts to the degree of \nraising a security concern. See AG \u00b6 29(e). \nAn October 29, 2010 medical note states, \u201cPt [states] he no longer wishes to \ncontinue mental health treatment, despite no change in his poorly controlled social \nanxiety [signs and symptoms]. Strongly recommend to pt that he reconsider his decision. \nPt [states] he is sure about his current decision to terminate treatment.\u201d (Tr. 53; GE 6 at \n7) After a suicide attempt in which he made superficial cuts to his wrists, he received \ninpatient mental-health treatment from November 28 to 30, 2018.

He summarized his report as follows:  \n[Applicant\u2019s] recurring suicidal ideation depression, poor engagement in, \nand follow through with psychiatric treatment, and his endorsement of \nsevere psychopathology on the MMPI-3 indicate the presence of significant \nmental health concerns and the need for current, ongoing, engagement in \nmental health services (i.e. therapy, medication management, etc.). (GE 3 \nat 5) \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is established. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant \ndid not establish \u201congoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan,\u201d see AG \u00b6 \n29(a). He is not \u201ccurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified mental health professional,\u201d see AG \u00b6 29(b). He did not provide a \n\u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or acceptable \nto and approved by, the U.S. Government that [his] previous condition is under control or \nin remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation,\u201d see AG \u00b6 29(c). \nHe did not establish \u201cthe past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and [he] no longer shows indications of emotional instability,\u201d \nsee AG \u00b6 29(d). He did not prove \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem,\u201d see AG \u00b6 \n29(e). \nI have lingering concerns that Applicant will again be under stress in a social \nsituation, and he will make poor security-related decisions. Mental-health problems could \nresurface even without him being in a stressful situation. Without ongoing therapy or \ncounseling as Dr. S recommended, there is insufficient assurance that his mental-health \nproblems will not recur. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old technician for various training devices for complex \naviation systems. In 2017, he received an associate degree in programming and game \ndesign, and in 2001, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics engineering. He \nserved in the Air Force from 2002 to 2014, and he received an honorable discharge. \nWhen he was discharged from the Air Force, he was a staff sergeant. He did not receive \nany nonjudicial punishments while in the Air Force. The VA has awarded him a 70 percent \ndisability rating, which includes 50 percent for adjustment disorder and anxiety disorder. \nThere is no evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, or security violations. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. On June 20, 2022, Dr. S evaluated Applicant on behalf of the CAF. Dr. S \ndiagnosed him with: Social Anxiety Disorder and Personality Disorder, Unspecified with \nBorderline Features (by history). Dr. S concluded his suicidal ideation, depression, and \npossible personality disorder \u201ccould negatively impact his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding classified information or working in a cleared setting.\u201d (GE \n3 at 5) Dr. S said he had \u201chigh confidence\u201d in the accuracy of the information received \nfrom Applicant. He summarized his report as follows: \n[Applicant\u2019s] recurring suicidal ideation depression, poor engagement in, \nand follow through with psychiatric treatment, and his endorsement of \nsevere psychopathology on the MMPI-3 indicate the presence of significant \nmental health concerns and the need for current, ongoing, engagement in \nmental health services (i.e. therapy, medication management, etc.). (GE 3 \nat 5) \nThere is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Dr. S\u2019s evaluation, diagnosis, or \nprognosis. There is no mental-health diagnosis or prognosis from a qualified mental-\nhealth professional that undermines or contradicts Dr. S\u2019s evaluation. At the time of his \nsecurity clearance hearing, Applicant did not receive mental-health counseling or \ntreatment after Dr. S\u2019s evaluation. His consideration of resuming mental-health \ncounseling or treatment after his hearing is a positive step towards future reinstatement \nof his security clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 14 exhibits (AEs A-N). The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on July 25, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated four delinquent \ndebts exceeding $23,000. Allegedly, his delinquent debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed his second spouse ran off with the vehicle \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.in 2015 and refused to return it, resulting in the vehicle\u2019s being \nlater recovered by the seller and sold at auction for less than the amount owed. He \nfurther claimed that the car lender did not initially pursue a deficiency against him. He \nalso claimed that his most recent wife was responsible for the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt, which he \nis paying through a payoff agreement. He claimed, too, to have made $200 monthly \npayments to SOR creditor 1.c through March 2020 before defaulting for lack of funding. \nAddressing SOR creditor 1.d, He claimed that the vehicle pay loss covered by the car \nloan from the creditor was destroyed by fire in December 2020 and should have been \nreimbursed by gap insurance in early 2021. And, Applicant expressed remorse over his \nallowing his soon-to-be ex-spouse (i.e., his third wife) to handle their finances during \ntheir relationship. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in November 2002 and divorced in February 2012.

(GE 1; Tr. 31-32) \nSince October April 2014, Applicant has worked for his current employer as an \ninspector. (GE 1) He reported brief periods of unemployment in 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 37, 46) \nHe has held a full security clearance since July 2007. (GE 1; Tr. 74) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2010 and 2019, Applicant accumulated four delinquent accounts \nexceeding $23,000. (GEs 2-4) The SOR-listed debts are listed as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n(an individual account opened in 2013 with a $12,969 balance); 1.b (an individual \naccount opened in 2010 with a $5,224 balance); 1.c (an individual account opened in \n2012 with a $5,194 balance); and 1.d (a joint account opened in 2019 with a $979 \nbalance). (GEs 2-3; Tr. 35-39) \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies to a number of sources. He cited his \nsecond wife\u2019s becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol, running off with his car in April \n2015 and refusing to return it. (GE 2; Tr. 36) Unable to recover the car on his own, he \ncontacted local police, who recovered the vehicle in May 2015. With no assistance \nforthcoming from either the police or his lender, he settled on letting his lender \nrepossess the vehicle with the help of a towing company. (Applicant\u2019s response)) \nAccording to Applicant, the car was sold at auction for less than the amount owed on \nthe vehicle, leaving a deficiency balance covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. After being informed by \nthe car lender of its decision not to pursue collection of a deficiency balance, he \nreceived a deficiency letter from a collection agent several months later, demanding \npayment of the deficiency balance owing after the auction sale. He iignored the latter \nfrom the collection agent and has since lost all of the documentation pertaining to \ncollection during his numerous moves. (Tr. 36) \nAddressing the alleged $979 balance owing the creditor covered by SOR \u00b6l 1.d, \nApplicant continues to dispute any balance owing the creditor on his third wife\u2019s car \nloan. (Applicant\u2019s response and AEs F and K; Tr. .54, 57) The dispute can be traced to \nApplicant\u2019s financing of a purchase of a new vehicle in April 2019 for $48,102. (GE 2) In \nDecember 2020, the car, along with his tools, were destroyed in a shop fire. (GE 4 and \nAEs B, F and K) With his gap insurance, he secured a measure of financial relief. His \ngap insurance carrier, in turn, covered its assessed value of the vehicle with a final \npayment of $31,213 in January 2021. (AEs B and F) However, his car lender disputed \nthe gap insurer\u2019s total loss payment, claiming the payment was not enough to pay off \nthe car loan. (AE K) Whether the additional approved $7,111 insurance payment \nearmarked for his car lender payee was enough to cover any shortfall from the loss of \nthe vehicle is unclear. (AEs B and K) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s account, his dispute with his SOR \u00b6 1.d creditor has \nnever been resolved, and the lender has continued to hold him responsible for the $979 \nshortfall. (Applicant\u2019s response and AE K) Still believing the gap insurance loss payoff \nshould have relieved him of any further loan responsibilities, he has never paid the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlender its claimed $979 loan balance. (AE K) Subsequent efforts by him to enlist the \ndivorce court\u2019s assistance in revising the parties\u2019 settlement agreement to direct his ex-\nspouse to pay off any remaining balance on the SOR \u00b6 1.d debt were unsuccessful. \n(AEs H-I) \nApplicant cited additional burdens placed on his finances by the 2023 child \nsupport and alimony order imposed on him based on the claims of his third wife, and his \nown failures to make more concerted follow-up checks on the status of the delinquent \naccounts in issue. (AEs L and O-Q; Tr. 38-56, 78) His furnished documentation does \nvalidate his efforts to refinance his home in 2022 to increase his available cash to better \naddress his remaining debts. (AE N) While his efforts to refinance his home were \nunsuccessful, they reflect good-faith attempts on his part to resolve his debts. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has since resolved two of his debt delinquencies with \neither payoffs or payment agreements. He documented his resolution of his SOR \u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c accounts with payment agreements and a lump sum payoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.b \naccount. (AEs E and R; Tr. 41-44, 46-49) At the time of his settlement agreements, the \nSOR 1.b debt was in collection status; while the SOR 1.c debt was charged off. (GEs 2-\n4) He had fallen behind with these debts during a period of unemployment in 2013. \n(Applicant\u2019s response and AE J) By the time he learned that his second spouse had not \ntaken care of the account, the account had become delinquent.  \nSimilar circumstances prevented Applicant from timely addressing his SOR \u00b6 1.c \ndebt payments. As a divorcee, Naval reservist, and single and custodial parent, \nresponsible for his two sons, he encountered tough sledding in keeping up with all of his \ndebts and let his SOR \u00b6 1.c account slip into delinquent status. (AE J) Complicating his \nability to address this account were the child support orders obtained by his first wife \nwho had regained custody of Applicant\u2019s sons. (AE J) Meeting his monthly child support \nobligations compounded his already strained finances. \nApplicant currently earns $130,000 a year in base salary and another $5,000 a \nyear in earned overtime with his latest promotion. (Tr. 34) Preceding his promotion, he \nearned $110,000 annually after starting with an entrance salary of $100,000. (Tr. 34-\n35). Before his divorce, his third wife contributed financially to his family with part-time \nwork. (Tr. 35) Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses consist of mortgage payments ($2,000), car \npayments ($2,000), food ($1,000); car insurance ($250); utilities ($100-$300); and child \nsupport and alimony payments ($1,700). (GE 4; Tr. 47-48, 51-53) He estimated a \nmonthly remainder of $1,200 to $1,500, which he has used in the past to cover medical \nand plumbing issues. (Tr. 47)  \nEndorsements and awards \nApplicant is well-regarded by his supervisors and colleagues.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). In \nApplicant\u2019s case, his debt delinquencies are attributable to several contributing factors: \nspousal lapses in addressing their respective joint creditor responsibilities, unexpected \nchild and alimony payments associated with his recent 2023 divorce, and his own \nlapses in failing to follow up on the status of his debts in issue. \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance\u201d; 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and \nis adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d; \nand 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue.\u201d While Applicant has been dilatory about monitoring and addressing his debts, \nextenuating circumstances and mitigating conditions have been major factors.

His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old engineer currently sponsored by a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in May 2016, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time university program of study in August 2016. He completed the program in May 2020, and was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have children. Applicant completed his first SCA in March 2021, while being sponsored by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs). He disclosed that Customs determined he was ineligible for a security clearance and thus denied his request for a clearance. (Item 4 at 7, and Item 3 at 60) He previously disclosed in his SCA that he purchased and used marijuana from September 2016 through February 2021, and that the frequency of his marijuana use was \u201capproximately 4-5 times per month.\u201d He stated he used marijuana for \u201cstress relief.\u201d (Item 2 at 43 through 44) He also indicated his intention to continue using marijuana in the future, responding \u201cyes\u201d to this question.

The \nGovernment exhibits, including Items 1 through 4, are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted, without comment, to the single \nallegation of drug involvement in this SOR. His admission is incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old engineer currently sponsored by a defense contractor. \nHe graduated from high school in May 2016, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time \nuniversity program of study in August 2016. He completed the program in May 2020, and \nwas awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have \nchildren. \nApplicant completed his first SCA in March 2021, while being sponsored by the \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs). He disclosed that Customs determined \nhe was ineligible for a security clearance and thus denied his request for a clearance. \n(Item 4 at 7, and Item 3 at 60) He previously disclosed in his SCA that he purchased and \nused marijuana from September 2016 through February 2021, and that the frequency of \nhis marijuana use was \u201capproximately 4-5 times per month.\u201d He stated he used marijuana \nfor \u201cstress relief.\u201d (Item 2 at 43 through 44) He also indicated his intention to continue \nusing marijuana in the future, responding \u201cyes\u201d to this question. (Item 2 at 44) \nApplicant subsequently completed his second nearly identical SCA in November \n2021, this time, sponsored by a defense contractor. (Item 3) He made additional updated \ndisclosures in his second SCA. For example, he disclosed he continued to use marijuana \nthrough September 2021, with the same frequency and for the same stated purpose of \nstress relief. He also continued to purchase marijuana during this period. He did not \ninclude the additional dates because marijuana, he stated, was no longer illegal in his \nstate. Rather than through friends and others, he purchased marijuana through a state \ndispensary. (Item 3 at 57 through 59) He again stated his intention to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 58) \nIn his February 2022 interview, after the investigator informed him using marijuana \nwas federally illegal, Applicant stated he would discontinue using marijuana if this affects \nhis job and that he would have no future intent. He previously stated during the same \ninterview that he was not dependent on marijuana, that he could stop using it at any time, \nand that he had never received treatment or counseling for marijuana use. He also told \nthe investigator marijuana had a calming effect on him and that he used it to relieve stress. \n(Item 4 at 7) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn about November 2022, prior to issuance of the SOR, Applicant verified the \naccuracy of his summarized interview with DoD investigators, and responded to specific \nquestions concerning his most recent drug involvement.

(Item 4 at 9) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifications under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement is recent and frequent. He has taken no action to discontinue his \nfederally illegal use of marijuana. Instead, he doubled down on his stated desire and \nintention to continue possessing and using marijuana in the future. Finally, he has never \nreceived treatment or counseling for his use of marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement security concerns. He is not a suitable candidate for access \nto classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Section 23 of the application, concerning Illegal drug use, asked, \u201cIn the last \nseven years have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d and, \u201cwhile \npossessing a security clearance have you ever illegally used or otherwise been involved \nwith a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other than \npreviously listed?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. In December 2017, she \nwas granted a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nApplicant began working for defense contractor B in September 2019, where she \ncurrently remains employed. On October 25, 2021, Applicant completed a second \nsecurity clearance application. \nThis time, in response to questions in Section 23, \nApplicant admitted that she had used marijuana within the past seven years, from June \n2016 to June 2019. (Government Exhibit 3.) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted that she used marijuana with varying frequency between June 2016 and June \n2019. \nShe also admitted to using marijuana with varying frequency from about \nDecember 2017 to about June 2019, while granted access to classified information. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant also stated that her use of marijuana occurred while she was in college \nand between the time she was employed with defense contractor A and defense \ncontractor B. She further stated that between those jobs, she worked for a non-cleared, \nnon-government contractor company for about six months. She stated that her use of \nmarijuana was minimal and that it was not a habit or regular occurrence. She stated \nthat it has been several years since she has used marijuana, and she has no intentions \nof ever using it again. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nApplicant also stated that she never intended to mislead the Government on her \nJune 2017 security clearance application She explained that it was a mistake of youth \nand misunderstanding. When she initially filled out the security clearance application in \nJune 2017, she thought the question only referred to hard core drug use and not \nmarijuana use.

(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant used marijuana from \nJune 2016 to June 2019 at times, while possessing a security clearance. Applicant \nstated that she is no longer using marijuana, and that she has no intentions of ever \nusing it in the future. Her credibility is in question. Given the fact that she was not \nhonest and truthful about her illegal drug use in the first place, her actions have not \nbeen mitigated. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted \nwith the facts, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncause or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or \na person with professional responsibilities for advising or \ninstructing \nthe \nindividual \nspecifically \nconcerning \nsecurity \nprocesses. \nUpon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed \nto untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant lied about her illegal drug use on her June 2017 security clearance \napplication. \nShe knew or should have known to follow the instructions on the \napplication and answer the question honestly. She contends that she was a young and \nimmature engineer at the time. However, this is no excuse for her misconduct. As a \nresult of the false information she provided, she obtained a security clearance under \nfalse pretenses. Her lack of credibility gives the government no confidence that she will \nvoluntarily comply with required rules and regulations imposed in order to properly \nprotect classified information. To be eligible for access to classified information an \nindividual must demonstrate sufficient maturity and responsibility, often requiring them \nto self-report their misconduct. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her marijuana use on her \nJune 2017 security clearance application falls short of meeting the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information, and clearly demonstrates dishonesty, \nunreliability, and untrustworthiness that is not tolerated by the defense department. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live her life to her \nconvenience, and disregarded Federal law, knowing that the use of any illegal drug is \nagainst DoD policy. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the \nrequisite character or judgment of someone who has the maturity, integrity, and \nreliability necessary to access classified information. At this time, Applicant does not \nmeet the eligibility qualifications for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. She \nunderstands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance and knows \nthat illegal drug use is not tolerated. \nApplicant is not an individual in whom the \nGovernment can be confident that she will always follow rules and regulations and do \nthe right thing, even when no one is looking. At this time, Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct and Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a   \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old hardware test engineer employed by a defense contractor since September 2020. He attended a university from August 2011 to May 2020, when he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He took more than the usual four years to earn his degree, because he worked full time while attending college. He has never married and has no children. He has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges multiple instances of drug involvement from May 2007 to September 2022. The evidence concerning each of the allegations of drug involvement alleged in the SOR is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: use of marijuana with varying frequency from about May 2007 to September 2022. When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana recreationally a \u201cfew times per year,\u201d less than 100 times in his lifetime, between May 2007 and August 2020. He stated that people with whom he associates use marijuana regularly because it is legal where he lives. He stated that he does not seek it out or use it regularly, but he uses it at social settings such as parties.

Applicant \nreceived the FORM on February 8, 2023, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old hardware test engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor since September 2020. He attended a university from August 2011 to May \n2020, when he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He took more than the usual four years to \nearn his degree, because he worked full time while attending college. He has never \nmarried and has no children. He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges multiple instances of drug involvement from May 2007 to \nSeptember 2022. The evidence concerning each of the allegations of drug involvement \nalleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: use of marijuana with varying frequency from about May 2007 to\nSeptember 2022. \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used \nmarijuana recreationally a \u201cfew times per year,\u201d less than 100 times in his lifetime, \nbetween May 2007 and August 2020. He stated that people with whom he associates \nuse marijuana regularly because it is legal where he lives. He stated that he does not \nseek it out or use it regularly, but he uses it at social settings such as parties. (FORM \nItem 3 at 46) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in August 2021, Applicant stated that he \nhad stopped using marijuana because of a \u201cjob requirement.\u201d He stated that his last use\nwas in the spring or summer of 2021, in a jurisdiction where marijuana use is legal,\nwhen a joint of marijuana was passed around outside a bar. He stated that he did not\nintend to use illegal drugs or controlled substances in the future. (FORM Item 4 at 3-4)  \n \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2022, Applicant admitted that \nhe used marijuana once in July 2022 and once in September 2022. In response to a \nquestion whether he intended to use illegal substances in the future, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d \nHe explained: \u201cI answered No, as I do not intend to use marijuana. My reason is that I \nnever seek it out, it is always a chance occasion that I am offered it and accept. It is \nvery present in [the jurisdiction where he lives] as legal recreational use and I reject it \nquite often.\u201d (FORM Item 5 at 15-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: purchase of marijuana from March 2010 to about August 2020. \nApplicant disclosed his purchases of marijuana in his SCA.

(FORM Item 5 at 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: involvement in the purchase of heroin from April to December \n2016. Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he was dating a person who was addicted to \nheroin, and he gave her a ride to the site where she purchased it. (FORM Item 3 at 46) \nHe gave the same answer when he was interviewed by a security investigator in March \n2021. He no longer involved with this person. (Answer to SOR; FORM Item 4 at 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: use of Ecstasy in the fall of 2016. During an interview with a \nsecurity investigator in March 2021, Applicant admitted using Ecstasy one time at a \nparty in the fall of 2016. He told the investigator that he did not intend to use it again. \n(FORM Item 5 at 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: use of cocaine in May 2016 and October 2016. Applicant disclosed \nin his SCA that he smoked crack cocaine once and snorted cocaine once. He stated \nthat he did not intend to use cocaine again because it is addictive. (FORM Item 3 at 45) \nHe told a security investigator that he used cocaine with a woman who is no longer his \ngirlfriend. (FORM Item 5 at 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: use of psilocybin mushrooms. Applicant disclosed in his SCA that \nhe used mushrooms twice, once in high school and once in college. (FORM Item 3 at \n44) He told a security investigator that he used mushrooms in college and found that \nthey had a psychedelic effect on him. He told the investigator that he would use them \nagain if he were in a country where they were legal. (FORM Item 5 at 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j: use of prescription medications (Adderall, Vyvanse,\nand Percocet) that were not prescribed for him.\n \n Applicant disclosed in his SCA and \nduring his interview with a security investigator that he used Vyvanse once in high \nschool, Percocet once in high school, and Adderall once in college. (FORM Item 3 at \n43-44; FORM Item 5 at 7-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: use of opium. Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he smoked an \nopium joint once in March 2012. He stated that he intends to never use opiates again \nbecause he has seen firsthand how they destroy the lives of addicted persons.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nApplicant\u2019s equivocal answers to questions about his future use of marijuana are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(g) (\u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse; or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nuse\u201d). However, his failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue his \nmarijuana use was not alleged in the SOR. Thus, I have considered his equivocal \nanswers for the limited purposes of evaluating the evidence of mitigation and as part of \nmy whole person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established for Applicant\u2019s isolated instances of experimentation \nwith Ecstasy, cocaine, opium, mushrooms, prescription stimulants, and prescription pain \nkillers while he was in high school and college. It is not established for his use of \nmarijuana, which is recent and frequent. His equivocal response to the question in the \nSeptember 2022 interrogatories, asking whether he will use marijuana again, precludes \na finding that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. A security clearance investigation \nis not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or parse the truth narrowly. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) His answers to questions about future drug \ninvolvement fall short of a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue his use of \nmarijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant used marijuana as recently as \nSeptember 2022. He continues to associate with marijuana users and has not changed \nthe environment where marijuana is used. He has not provided the statement of intent \nprovided for in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The record closed on September 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineer employed by defense contractors since \nOctober 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1989 to July 2009 and \nretired as a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8). He was employed by the Navy after \nretiring until January 2011. He was employed by federal contractors until April 2020, when \nhe was fired after he was arrested for driving under the influence. He was hired by a \ndefense contractor in February 2021 and hired by his current employer in August 2021. \nHe contracted COVID-19 in September, was hospitalized until October 2021, and \nreturned to work in November 2021. He received 80% of his regular pay while he was \nrecovering. (GX 3 at 2) He held a security clearance in the Navy and continued to hold it \nas a civilian employee and as an employee of a federal contractor. \nApplicant married in December 1992, divorced in April 2014, and remarried in \nNovember 2014. He adopted his current wife\u2019s three children, twins born in October 2002 \nand a daughter born in September 2000, to remove them from an abusive relationship, \nand he incurred substantial legal expenses to do so. (Answer; Tr. 20; GX 1 at 26-29) He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2020 and is working toward a master\u2019s degree. \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts, reflected in credit reports from October \n2022 (GX 4), December 2021 (GX 5), and January 2021 (GX 6). Applicant told a security \ninvestigator that his ex-wife had opened many credit accounts in his name and without \nhis knowledge and accumulated more debt than they could manage. (GX 2 at 8) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Credit-card debt charged off for $30,071. This debt was a joint \naccount with Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. When they divorced, they agreed to divide the marital \nassets outside the court action, but they could not come to an agreement about some of \nthe debts. Applicant testified that this creditor agreed to consolidate the mortgage loan on \nhis home, this credit-card account, and the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He testified that he \nbelieved that after the mortgage loan was foreclosed and the home was sold, the \nproceeds of the sale would be used to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.

(GX 4 at 5) Applicant submitted a credit report dated August 4, \n2023, which lists three old accounts with this creditor that were closed in 2015, but it does \nnot reflect the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (AX B). He testified that the debts \nwere removed from his credit report \u201cbecause of the paperwork.\u201d (Tr. 29) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Loan charged off for $72,694. Applicant testified that this debt was \nfor the purchase of a boat.

(Tr. 35-36) He provided \nno documentation to support his testimony. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Credit-card account placed for collection of $519. Applicant \ntestified that he paid this debt with a loan obtained through his employer. (Tr. 41-42) He \nprovided no documentation to support his testimony.

(Tr. 46; \nAX B at 16) The debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Cellphone account placed for collection of $2,035. Applicant \ndisputes this debt. He testified that, when he switched service providers, a representative \nof the new provider promised that they would transfer the account and pay the amount \ndue on the old account. (Tr. 47) He submitted a credit report reflecting that the account is \ndisputed. (AX B at 106) He provided no evidence that the dispute has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: Credit-card account charged off for $390. Applicant testified that he \npaid this debt, but the credit report he submitted reflects that the account was charged \noff.

This debt was incurred \nwhen Applicant withdrew funds from his 401(k) account, but did not report the withdrawal \non his return for 2016. In September 2019, the IRS assessed additional tax of $4,573, a \npenalty of $3,995, and interest of $2,909. Applicant made a $100 payment in January \n2020, which was dishonored. He made a $125 payment in March 2020. He made no \npayments after he was fired in April 2020. He established an installment agreement in \nAugust 2020, but it was terminated in May 2021. He made another installment agreement \nin March 2022, but he made no payments because he disputed the amount due. (GX 3a \nat 3, 4; Tr. 55) He provided no explanation or evidence of the basis for the dispute. \nApplicant recently hired a debt-relief company to help him. On June 21, 2023, the \nIRS informed him that it was contacted on June 23, 2023, by him or his authorized third \nparty (probably the debt-relief company). The IRS informed him that it would respond \nwithin 90 days. (AX A) As of the date the record closed, the debt was not resolved. \nApplicant provided no evidence of a response from the IRS and did not request additional \ntime to obtain it. \nApplicant submitted evidence of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau consent \norder applicable to the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The Bureau found that the \ncreditor violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by making deceptive \nrepresentations to consumers in connection with its debt collection practices and unfairly \nrestricting consumers\u2019 electronic account access. (AX G) Applicant has not asserted that \nhe was the victim of any of the deceptive representations or unfair restrictions on his \naccount access. Instead, he testified that he asked the creditor to consolidate his home \nmortgage loan and two credit card accounts into a single loan. He testified that he \nerroneously thought that the consolidation had occurred, that the mortgage on the home \nhad been foreclosed, and that the proceeds of the foreclosure sale had been used to pay \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 30-31) \nApplicant\u2019s total monthly income is about $6,500. (Tr. 61) He testified that his \nmonthly net remainder after paying all household expenses is between $200 and $500 \nper month, depending on how much he earns in the summer as a baseball umpire. (Tr. \n64) \nA colleague of Applicant who has worked with him for about 19 months regards \nhim as a superb leader who assumed the role of a chief engineer and turned around what \nhad been a very dysfunctional operation. He considers Applicant a person of integrity, \nholding himself accountable for the work of his team and treating everyone with dignity \nand respect. (AX D) \nAnother colleague also observed how Applicant reformed a dysfunctional \noperation and instilled \u201cinspired work habits and quality work deliverables.\u201d He considers \nApplicant \u201ca man of integrity, a man of strength, a family man, a man of honor, that can \nbe counted on when times are good and when times are not so good.\u201d (AX E) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA third colleague describes Applicant as \u201ca high-minded individual of exceptional \ncharacter and integrity.\u201d He states that there have been countless occasions when \nApplicant has proven to be \u201ca class apart, in terms of possessing an impeccable \ncharacter.\u201d (AX F) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure . . . to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

Jul. 7, 2016). The fact that a creditor is no longer actively \nseeking payment or that a debt is not otherwise collectable does not establish that the \ndebt has been resolved within the meaning of the Directive. ISCR Case No. 10-03656 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully established. Applicant submitted documentary evidence that \nhe had disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but he provided no evidence that the \ndispute had been resolved in his favor or that the debt was otherwise resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Although Applicant has corresponded with the IRS \nregarding his tax debt, he had not resolved it as of the date the record closed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s long and \nhonorable service on active duty in the U.S. Navy, as a civilian employee of the Navy, \nand as a respected employee of a defense contractor. He was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. However, he has not overcome the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. In several instances, he described reasonable actions to resolve his debts, but he \nfailed to provide documentary evidence to support his testimony, even after being given \nadditional time to obtain and provide it. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 29, 2021. On \nJanuary 4, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G, J, and E. The CAS acted under Executive Order \n(Exec.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April \n4, 2023, and the case was assigned to me on September 9, 2023. On September 22, \n2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on October 16, 2023. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record \nopen until October 31, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the amended SOR, he admitted all the \nallegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March \n1996 to April 2019 when he was involuntarily retired with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. He was a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8) when he retired. \nHe held a security clearance during his military service. \nApplicant was unemployed from April to August 2019. He worked for federal \ncontractors from August 2019 to July 2023. The record does not reflect the circumstances \nof his termination from employment in July 2023. At the time of the hearing, he had been \noffered a job by another defense contractor, contingent on favorable adjudication of his \napplication to continue his security clearance. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant married in April 2000 and has two daughters, ages 22 and 18. He and \nhis wife have lived separately since December 2021, but they are not legally separated. \n(Tr. 14-15) He attended college from July to September 2008 but did not receive a degree. \n(GX 1 at 10-11; Tr. 15-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to \nthe point of intoxication, from about May 2017 to at least January 2022. Applicant admitted \nthis allegation in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that he was drinking \nevery night during this period and that he was \u201cgetting close\u201d to drinking every night to the \npoint of intoxication. (Tr. 25). \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of \nan incident that led to nonjudicial punishment for sexual assault in February 2018, an \nincident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in August 2020, \nand an incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in October \n2021.

Although Applicant \nadmitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, I doubt that he fully understood what \nhe was admitting, because when he was asked at the hearing to describe what happened, \nhe described the sexual assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which occurred in May 2017, while \nhe was assigned overseas. (Tr. 19) The FBI arrest record reflects an arrest that occurred \nin the United States in October 2017, but it does not list the offense that was the basis for \nthe arrest. (GX 3) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the basis for \nthis arrest. I conclude that the part of SOR \u00b6 2.a that alleges an arrest is established, but \nthe part alleging that the arrest was for abusive sexual contact is not established by his \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR or any evidence in the record. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment in February \n2018 for sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The \nassault occurred in May 2017. Applicant and group of fellow sailors were at a party, and \nApplicant was intoxicated. He came up from behind a female sailor, hugged her, touched \nher breast, and asked her if she would go to bed with him. Applicant appeared before his \ncommanding officer, was found guilty of a sexual assault, and received nonjudicial \npunishment of a forfeiture of $2,618 of his pay. In March 2018, he was referred to an \nadministrative separation board, which determined that he should be retained in the Navy. \nShortly after Applicant was punished, he was transferred to another command. In \nMarch 2019, he was notified that he was required to retire. He retired in April 2019 and \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. (AX A) The Certificate of \nRelease or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214) recites that the reason for \nseparation was \u201csufficient service for retirement.\u201d (AX A) The DD Form 214 reflects that \nduring his military service, he received the Good Conduct Medal (six awards), \nOutstanding Military Volunteer Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal \n(three awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two letters of \nappreciation and commendation, and various service medals and qualification badges \nand ribbons. \nApplicant testified that his marital problems began after his retirement. While on \nactive duty, he was deployed frequently, and it was not until he was at home for a while \nthat he realized that his wife and a neighbor were drinking heavily and using drugs during \nthe day. He believed that they had been drinking and using drugs for a couple years \nbefore his retirement. (Tr. 40) \nApplicant attributed all the domestic violence incidents to his heavy drinking, \nfollowed by arguments with his wife. He testified that the incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c \noccurred in August 2020, when he was working nights and came home at about 11:30 \npm. He testified that his wife and her friend had been \u201cgetting wasted all day.\u201d He started \ndrinking and began arguing with his wife. His wife claimed that he pushed her, and he \nclaimed that he pushed her away when she was screaming \u201cin his face.\u201d His wife called \nthe police, and they told him, \u201cthey got to take somebody,\u201d and he was arrested.

Applicant\u2019s wife accused him of throwing a beer \ncan at her. Applicant\u2019s daughter called the police, and they arrested Applicant for assault \nand battery on a family member. (Tr. 29) At a court hearing a couple of months later, \nadjudication was deferred, conditioned on good behavior for two years. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking heavily after he and his wife separated. \nHe testified that he now limits himself to a couple beers while watching football and no \nlonger drinks hard liquor. He has not received any formal counseling or treatment for his \nalcohol consumption. He is not involved with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or any similar \norganization. (Tr. 33-34, 42) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set in AG \u00b6 21. \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the \nconduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nIf the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant \nadmitted that he consumed alcohol in excess until \u201cat least January 2022.\u201d After \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s long history of excessive alcohol consumption, his continued \nconsumption of alcohol, his failure to seek counseling or treatment, and his unsettled \nrelationship with his wife, whom he blames for his excessive drinking, I conclude that the \nevidence falls short of showing reform or rehabilitation or that his conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. Although Applicant has acknowledged his \nmaladaptive alcohol use, he provided no evidence of counseling, treatment, or other \nsupportive measures such as participation in AA. For these reasons and the reasons in \nthe above discussion of AG \u00b6 23(a), I am not convinced that he has demonstrated an \nestablished pattern of modified consumption. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are established by the evidence: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6 23(a). \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not fully established. The record does not reflect any criminal activity \nafter Applicant\u2019s last arrest in October 2021, and he apparently complied with the terms \nof his two-year probation. However, he submitted no evidence of a good post-Navy \nemployment record, job training, higher education, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s drunken altercations with his wife in August \n2020 and October 2021. It is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s sexual assault on a female \nsailor in February 2018, which was a serious offense sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established by Applicant\u2019s sexual assault on a female sailor in \nFebruary 2018 and domestic violence in August 2020 and October 2021. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s domestic incidents were arguably \nminor, but his sexual misconduct with a female sailor was not minor. His behavior was\nnot infrequent and did not happen under unique circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his behavior and \nhe is living apart from his wife, but he has not obtained counseling or taken other \nmeasures to deal with his excessive alcohol consumption. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and numerous. He submitted no evidence showing that they were incurred under \nunusual circumstances or circumstances largely beyond his control. He submitted no \nevidence of financial counseling, payments, or payment plans. He has not disputed any \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. In his answer to the SOR, he promised to resolve some \nof the debts by May 2023 and the rest by December 2023. However, promises to resolve \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Furthermore, evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \nSee ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She intends to purchase a \nhome. (Items 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $9,358 charged-off debt. Applicant stated in her Answer that this \naccount was paid and closed after her car was sold. This debt was not reported on the \nJuly and October 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 1, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a $2,602 collection account involving an eviction action filed by \nApplicant\u2019s former landlord in September 2015.

Her October 2022 credit bureau report reflects that she \nis disputing any debt associated with the collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 1, 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $1,010 collection account. Applicant stated in her Answer that this \naccount was deleted from her credit bureau report because the creditor reported \nerroneous information.

She also stated that \nshe lacked the income to pay this debt due to her periods of unemployment. (Items 1, 3-\n5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.n are two charged-off debts with the same creditor, for $498 \nand $224, respectively.

(Items 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.d, 1.f through 1.h, 1.k through 1.l, and 1.o through 1.t are \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent medical debts. She stated in her Answer that some of these \nmedical debts were paid by either her primary or secondary health insurance, and \nothers were deleted from her credit bureau report. A June 2018 credit bureau report \nreflects that she successfully disputed various medical debts, and they were \nconsequently deleted from her credit bureau report. She also provided health insurance \ndocumentation reflecting claims processed between 2018 and 2022, in which her \nmember responsibility was $0. She maintains that these claims are the same medical \ndebts as those alleged in the SOR. Her most recent credit bureau report does not list \nany delinquent medical debts. (Items 1-4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying her \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her delinquent debts. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Her documentation and the credit reports corroborate her \nstated efforts to dispute or otherwise resolve her delinquent debts. She acknowledged \nthat her period of unemployment affected her ability to pay SOR \u00b6 1.i. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, \n1.m, 1.n, and no medical debts are reported on her most recent credit bureau report \nfrom October 2022. That credit report reflects that she is disputing SOR \u00b6 1.b, as the \ncollection agency for that debt was associated with an eviction proceeding against her \nthat was dismissed in 2015. She believed she successfully disputed SOR \u00b6 1.e in 2018. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns arising from her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.t: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He was placed on dialysis \nin 2013 and was told he would need a kidney transplant. He received his medical care \nprimarily from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

(AE 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems can be attributed to the costs associated with \nmoving his family to the United States in 2011, furnishing their new home, his two \ndivorces, and the unemployment after he left a job to better his chance at receiving a \nnew kidney. Most of those expenses were beyond his control. \nAbout $120,000 from Applicant\u2019s 401(k) retirement account was disbursed to him \nafter he left his job in 2017. There were tax implications. He decided to \u201cday trade\u201d \nabout $50,000 in the stock market. He was unsuccessful, and he lost about $50,000. \nThat was irresponsible conduct and is a major reason Applicant still has financial \nproblems. Had he used that money to pay his taxes and some of his other debts, or \neven if he rolled the money over into another retirement account, it is likely his finances \nwould be significantly better. \nApplicant decided that he would address his taxes before his consumer debts. \nHe paid $300 toward his 2014 taxes in January 2020. He entered into an installment \nagreement with the IRS in February 2020. He regularly made the $600 payments, and \nmore recently the new amount of $552 per month. He still owes several thousand \ndollars for 2016 and more than $45,000 for 2017, but I believe his taxes will eventually \nbe paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the taxes are eventually paid. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to pay his taxes on time continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nThe mitigation provided by the installment plan is lessened because his tax debt \nresulted largely from his reckless conduct. \nApplicant has done nothing to address his consumer debts. He owes about \n$36,000 for debts alleged in the SOR, another $30,000 for a non-alleged debt, and \nabout $50,000 to the IRS. He stated that he plans to pay his consumer debts after he \npays his taxes. That could take years, and intentions to resolve financial problems in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \nconsumer debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nthrough 20(d) do not apply. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 4, was provided to \nApplicant, who received the file on October 17, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 43 years old, unmarried, and has no children. He served in the U.S. \nNavy from August 1997 until his medical discharge in October 1997. He has been \nemployed by a U.S. Government contractor as a project manager since December 2013. \nApplicant has held a security clearance in the past and seeks to renew his national \nsecurity eligibility in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at Sections 1, 12, 13A, 17, \n18, 25; Item 4 at 1.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is \nfinancially irresponsible, which is evidenced by his failure to file his Federal tax returns \nfor tax years (TYs) 2013 through 2017, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and his failure to file his \nstate tax returns for TYs 2009, and 2013 through 2017, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

During \nhis security interview, he admitted that his untimeliness in filing his tax returns was due \nto laziness and forgetfulness. (Items1 at 27; Item 4 at 6.) \nThe record evidence regarding the two SOR allegations is as follows: \n1.a. Failure to file in a timely manner, as required, Federal income tax returns for \nTYs 2013 through 2017. Applicant submitted with his September 2022 Answer copies of \nhis Federal tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2017. The returns were self-prepared and \nare undated and unsigned. All four of the returns reflect that Applicant was entitled to \nrefunds ranging in amounts of $573 to $774. Applicant failed to provide a date or dates \nwhen he filed these tax returns. If the returns were in fact submitted, they had to have \nbeen filed after the November 2020 e-QIP and before the September 2022 Answer. Not \nonly were the returns submitted after their due dates, but Applicant is also likely barred \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom claiming any refunds due the three-year statute of limitations on refund claims. 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6511(a). (Item 1, Answer at 3, 5, 8,11.)  \nWith respect to his 2013 Federal tax return, Applicant wrote in his Answer that \n\u201c2013 was a mistake I made when filling out the form . . . 2013 was lost in a hard drive \nfailure.\u201d It appears that he is stating that he mistakenly included TY 2013 on the e-QIP as \na year in which he had not filed his Federal tax return. It further appears that he is stating \nthat he cannot provide a copy of the return due to a computer problem. Applicant provided \nno documentation to support a finding that he in fact filed his TY 2013 Federal tax return, \nor that his return was filed as required, i.e., on or before April 15, 2014. Though not alleged \nin the SOR, Applicant also disclosed in the e-QIP that he had not filed his Federal tax \nreturn for TY 2009. He provided no comments about that Federal tax return. \n1.b. Failure to file in a timely manner, as required, state income tax returns for TYs \n2009 and 2013 through 2017. Applicant responded to the Government\u2019s interrogatories \nin February 2022 and provided notices from his state government, dated September 9, \n2021. The notices covered the TYs 2014 through 2017. In the notices, the state \ngovernment advised Applicant that he was not eligible to receive refunds for these tax \nyears because his returns were filed more than three years after they were due. The \nnotices do not reflect when the returns for those tax years were filed, but they were likely \nfiled after his submission of the e-QIP in November 2020 in which he disclosed that his \nstate returns for the same years had not yet been filed. Applicant did not provide any \ninformation about his tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2013, which were both alleged in the \nSOR to have been filed untimely. He wrote in his response to the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories that he lost the document for TY 2013. With his response, he also provided \ndocumentation evidencing that he had paid a state tax lien in the amount of $2,221. The \ndocumentation does not reflect what tax year the lien covered, though it noted the date \nof the lien as February 13, 2016. The SOR does not allege the existence of a state tax \nlien. (Item 3 at 7-14.) \nIn the November 2020 e-QIP, Applicant wrote that, \u201c2018 has been mailed to both \nstate and federal, 2019 has been received by both state and federal.\u201d He provided no \nfiling dates for any of those returns. The vague information provided does not confirm that \nthat any of the returns were timely filed. By not responding to the Government\u2019s FORM, \nApplicant provided no more recent information regarding his subsequent tax returns to \ndemonstrate that he has changed his past practice of untimely tax filings. Applicant also \nelected not to submit any information about his work performance or ability to safeguard \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and the \ne-QIP establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden of \nproof shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not established. Applicant\u2019s untimely filing of tax \nreturns were frequent and did not occur under any unusual circumstances. In fact, \nthe circumstances were entirely under his control. He admitted that he was lazy \nand forgetful when it came to filing his tax returns on time for several years in a \nrow. Applicant presented no evidence to show a change in his behavior. His written \nstatements about his tax filings in 2018 and 2019 do not establish that he timely \nfiled those returns. He provided no evidence that untimely filings are unlikely to \nrecur. His behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is only partially established. Applicant provided notices from his \nstate government that he had filed his tax returns for the TYs 2014 through 2017. \nThe copies of his Federal tax returns for the same years were undated and \nunsigned and were not accompanied by any documentary evidence to establish \nthat they had been submitted, even if they were untimely. In fact, he provided no \npositive assertion that the returns had indeed been filed. Also, Applicant claimed \nwithout any supporting documentary evidence that he filed his TY 2013 Federal \nand state tax returns. His assertion that he lost the state notice with respect to TY \n2013 while retaining the notices for the four subsequent years is not credible. \nOverall, the evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant is willing to comply with \na basic rule, applicable to all U.S. taxpayers, to file tax returns in a timely manner. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial considerations. He has also not shown that there is little \nlikelihood of recurrence. The record evidence does not convince me that Applicant is \nreliable and has good judgment. Overall, the record evidence creates doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went into \ncollections between 2017 and 2021. That is not that long ago. The debts are numerous \nand remain in default today. His debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant was divorced in September \n2020, after 12 years of marriage and having two children, now adults. AG \u00b6 20(b) recites \n\u201cdivorce\u201d as a condition \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. That is the condition \nApplicant has confronted. The first element of that mitigating condition is, therefore, \nsatisfied. \nThe second element of AG \u00b6 20(b) is that an applicant act \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he faced. Applicant\u2019s divorce was sufficiently acrimonious that he \nwas unable to retrieve his naturalization certificate from the marital home, where his ex-\nwife now resides. And his divorce lawyer counseled that Applicant not contact his ex-wife \nabout the mortgage, because the divorce was so contentious. The only responsible option \nleft to Applicant was to allow the home to go through foreclosure, a process the record \nshows was occurring in March of this year. I find that SOR \u00b6 1.a has been mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe other five SOR debts total $2,071. The magnitude of that amount does not \nraise national security concerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He is married and has a four year old son. He has a \ntenth grade high school education.

The money he earned, he invested \nback into the business anticipating even more success. The following year, however, \ndue to COVID and its quarantine requirements, there was a drastic decline in business \nand Applicant could not keep up with financial responsibilities. In 2021, Applicant was \nforced to close the business. He then started looking for a job. At this point, however, \nhe had spent most of his savings simply trying to survive. He was forced to neglect \nsome bills and pay others in order to keep his family afloat. His mortgage and his car \npayment were his top priorities to ensure his family would have a place to live and \ntransportation. Other bills became delinquent. Applicant began working for his current \nemployer in October 2021. Since then, he has been slowly recovering, trying to pay off \nhis delinquent debts. He stated that he started by paying his smaller debts first, which \nincluded debts he owed to Lowes, Best Buy, and Home Depot. Applicant\u2019s wife is \nunemployed. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR were of security concern: \n1.a., is a delinquent debt owed to a creditor that was charged off in approximate \namount of $26,963. This was a credit card that Applicant used to help finance his \nbusiness, and to help pay for living expenses after closing his business. \n(Tr. p. 48.) \nApplicant has set up a payment agreement with the creditor. The debt will be paid off in \nregular monthly installments of $250. Applicant began his first payment of $250 on \nMarch 30, 2023, that will continue monthly until the debt is paid in full.

The debt is no longer owing. (Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Exhibit A.) \n1.f., is a delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $5,663. \nThis was for the lease of a Mazda X-9 that \nApplicant returned to the dealer because he could no longer afford the monthly \npayments of $408. (Tr. p. 57-58.) A letter from the creditor dated March 28, 2023, \nindicates that debt has been settled. The debt is no longer owing. (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit A.) \nApplicant stated that he was able to settle each of his debts by using his savings. \nAfter taxes, he brings home about $1,900 weekly. (Tr. p. 43.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to the pandemic, which caused the downturn in his business, Applicant \nbecame excessively indebted and could not afford to pay his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control primarily caused Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial indebtedness. Since obtaining full-time stable employment in October 2021, \nhe has directed his efforts at resolving his delinquent debt. He has successfully settled \nfive of his six debts and has set up a payment plan with the creditor to resolve the \nlargest and remaining debt. He has already started the regular monthly payments \ntowards resolving this remaining debt and plans to continue making these monthly \npayments until the debt is resolved. Ideally, Applicant should have contacted these \ncreditors before his security clearance became an issue. \nHowever, under the \ncircumstances, Applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner. He has \nshown good judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. There are clear indications that \nhis financial indebtedness is being resolved and is under control. \nApplicant has \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and has demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides full mitigation. \nThe Financial \nConsiderations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nshown maturity and responsibility. He has resolved each of his delinquent debts. He \nunderstands the importance of living within his means and paying his bills in a timely \nfashion. He also understands the responsibilities involved in possessing a security \nclearance. \nApplicant has shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of this privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Items 3, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $56,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). These delinquencies consist of car \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e), unpaid rental obligations (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a cable debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), unpaid tuition (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The car loans \ncomprise about $53,000 of the $56,000 total SOR indebtedness. He admitted the SOR \nallegations with additional comments. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nThe SOR allegations are established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. The SOR debts became delinquent between 2018 and 2021. (Items 3-7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2023 response to the SOR, he claimed that he satisfied the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d., and 1.f. on unspecified dates. He claimed he is making \npayments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He further claimed that the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a is \n\u201cclosed,\u201d and that he will attempt to make payment arrangements on the car loan in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. He failed to provide any documentary corroboration that he contacted the \nlenders, set up any payment plans for his SOR debts, or paid any of the accounts. \nContrary to department counsel\u2019s assertion that Item 4 provides proof that there is no \nbalance on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, I find that Item does not support her \nstatement. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about \nhis finances is not available. Given the lack of corroborating evidence, I find that the \nSOR debts remain unresolved. (Items 3-7) \nApplicant became delinquent on the SOR debts because he borrowed more \nmoney than he could afford to repay. While he did not explicitly offer his divorces as a \nbasis for his financial issues, they presumably played a role. He claimed that he earns \nenough income each month to pay his financial obligations. The evidence shows that he \nhas resolved other delinquent accounts in the past, but it also shows that he is behind \non four debts that were not included in the SOR. He provided no evidence that he has \nundergone financial counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has six delinquent debts totaling about $56,000, many of which are \nseveral years old. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are recent and ongoing. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts, but \nhe has not. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He has \nadditional debts that he is behind on that were not listed in the SOR. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 4, 6, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $32,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). These delinquencies consist of credit \ncards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d), a vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a medical bill (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c with additional comment. \nHis admissions are adopted as findings of fact. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e with additional comment. Despite his denials, those SOR allegations are \nestablished through the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; Items 3-10) \nThe delinquent credit cards in the amounts of $12,505 and $8,216, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, respectively, have not been resolved. Applicant opened the credit \ncard in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2004 and last made a payment on it in November 2017. He \nopened the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.c in April 2015 and last made a payment on it in \nNovember 2019. (Items 3-10) \nThe delinquent vehicle loan in the amount of $10,545 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has \nnot been resolved. Applicant opened this account in April 2014 when he financed the \npurchase of a vehicle. The last payment he made on this account was in January 2019. \n(Items 3-10) \nApplicant disputed owing the credit card in the amount of $879 listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. He agreed that he opened the credit card but denied making charges on it. He \nclaimed the credit card should not have a balance and believes that someone made \ncharges to this credit card without his authorization. He disputed the balance with the \ncredit reporting agencies, but he acknowledged that the dispute has not been resolved. \nThe Government\u2019s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports reflect that he has disputed this \naccount, but all three credit reports list it as an account in collection. Applicant provided \nno documentation to substantiate the basis of his dispute, nor has he provided \ndocumentation to show any resolution of his dispute. (Items 3-10) \nApplicant denied owing the medical debt for $170 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. because \nhe claimed that he does not recognize it and therefore does not know if he is \nresponsible for it. The debt was established in January 2022. He provided no evidence \nof any attempted resolution of this debt. He provided no documentation to substantiate \nthe basis of any dispute. The debt appears on the Government\u2019s 2022 credit report but \nnot on the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report. (Items 3, 9) \nApplicant has two additional delinquent debts that are not listed on the SOR. One \ndebt is a rental delinquency for $2,026 that is in collection.

(ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Item 10) \nApplicant claimed that the reason he became delinquent on the debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c is because his wife had a difficult pregnancy and health \nproblems that kept her from working. Her inability to work resulted in decreased income \nthat did not allow them to cover their expenses. In June 2022, he claimed that he would \narrange to pay these SOR debts in the future when his wife\u2019s health problems subside, \nand she is able to earn money again. He did not provide a timeline for when he thought \nhe might start paying these debts. He provided no evidence how he plans to resolve the \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. In June 2022, he provided a personal financial \nstatement showing that he has about a $500 monthly surplus. Therefore, he had at least \nsome available finances to address his SOR debts if he chose to do so. He provided a \npaystub from his employer for the May 14, 2022 through May 27, 2022 pay period \nshowing that he earned a net income of about $2,312. (Items 3-7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had five delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. Many of those debts \nhave been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The SOR \ndebts remain unresolved, and he has not provided a timeline for when he will resolve \nthem. He also has two additional financial delinquencies not listed in the SOR. I cannot \nfind that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his wife\u2019s health problems. These \nconditions were beyond his control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. He has not \nresolved any of the SOR debts. While he disputed the balance on the debt listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, he provided no documentation showing the result of that dispute. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Given these considerations, he \nhas failed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. The lack of evidence of the resolution of his SOR debts also makes AG \n\u00b6 20(d) inapplicable. \nApplicant disputed the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d because he believed he \ndid not have a balance on the account. This concern is a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt. He disputed the balance with the credit reporting \nagencies, which is reflected in the credit reports. However, the debt is still listed on the \ncredit reports, and he did not provide evidence of any resolution of the dispute.

ISCR Case No. 20-03691 at 3 (App. \nBd. March 29, 2023). For this same reason, Applicant\u2019s claim that he does not \nrecognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, without further evidence of resolution, is also \ninsufficient. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nNone of the Guideline F mitigating factors are fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On October 5, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a November 7, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

Applicant admits each of the allegations with explanations. Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated May 2, 2020; February 24, 2022; and December 14, 2022, confirm that \nhe is indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, \nand 6.) \nApplicant was married from 2015 to 2020. At some point, he and his wife \nseparated, and then divorced. Divorced proceedings which went on for an extended \nperiod, followed by a child custody battle. This was costly. His attorney fees and \nrelated costs totaled about $8,000. \nApplicant used credit cards to pay for living \nexpenses and household items, such as furniture, and appliances. Applicant ultimately \nobtained custody of his three children. (Tr. p. 20.) \nApplicant had stable full-time employment from 2012 to 2018. (Tr. p. 20.) He \nwas unemployed from September 2018 to early January 2019, and July 2019 to \nSeptember 2019, for a total of about six or seven months. (Tr. pp. 19-20.) He stated \nthat he had to borrow money from his mother to help with his living expenses. He \nexplained that was barely able to keep the expense of the house, the children, and their \nchildcare going. He could not afford to pay his debts, and he stopped making payments \non his credit card debt in 2018 or early 2019. He had no expendable money. (Tr. p. \n29.) Since 2018 or early 2019, no payments have been made towards the credit card \ndebt listed in the SOR. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in June 2020. He understood \nat the time that his job may require a security clearance. He was hired as a Machinist, \nand was recently promoted to be an Inspector.

He has a \n401(k) with about $7,000 and a pension that is not effective until he retires. (Tr. pp. 33 \nand 34.) \nApplicant initially testified that he was in the process of filing Bankruptcy to \ndischarge the debts listed in the SOR. However, he was advised by his Bankruptcy \nattorney to wait until after the hearing to determine if it is necessary, since all of his \ndelinquent debts will fall off of his credit report in 2025, because they are so old. (Tr. \npp. 22 and 34.) This will allow the Applicant to quickly rebuild his credit standing and \npossibly be able to purchase a house. Since September 2020, when he gained full-time \nemployment, Applicant has not made any payments towards resolving his delinquent \ndebts, nor has he contacted his creditors to set up payment arrangements. \nThe following delinquent credit card debts are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $10,460 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 29.) \n1.b.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $198 for an account that \nwas placed for collection. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 29.) \nApplicant testified that he also learned that if he contacts the creditor to set up a \npayment plan, the creditor can then legally come after him for payment through the \ncourt system. Since he has had no contact with the creditors for four years, at this \npoint, the Statute of Limitation has run, and the debts are over four years old, Applicant \nunderstands that the creditor has no recourse against him for payment. (Tr. p. 25-26.) \nApplicant further testified that in 2021, during his security clearance background \ninvestigation, the DoD investigator told him that he should file for Bankruptcy because it \nwould look better to the Government to have the debt gone than to have it sitting \ndelinquent on his credit report. \nApplicant stated that he chose not to follow his \nsuggestion because it would extend his period of bad credit and take longer for him to \nrebuild it.  (Tr. pp. 39 \u2013 40.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of excessive financial indebtedness and has not \naddressed his delinquent debts. His actions or inactions both demonstrated a history of \nnot addressing his debt and/or an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has incurred excessive delinquent debt, admittedly, partially caused by \nhis separation, divorce, child custody battle, and short periods of unemployment. \nHowever, despite these unfortunate past events, since September 2019, he has been \ngainfully employed on a full-time basis, and he has not addressed any of his delinquent \ndebt. Four years have passed and apparently, Applicant plans to wait until 2025 when \nhis delinquent debts fall off his credit report to avoid paying his debts or even \naddressing them in any manner. This does not demonstrate that he is responsible. \nInstead, it shows his lack of responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and \ninaction for so long casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant had not taken the necessary steps to show that he can properly \nresolve his financial delinquencies. He has avoided contacting the creditors or setting \nup regular systematic payments. This shows poor judgment and unreliability. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is no evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have \nbeen resolved. Overall, Applicant has made no progress towards resolving his debts. \nHe still owes about $60,000 to his creditors that he obviously has no intention of paying. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his \nburden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant has failed to \nshow financial responsibility and is not found to be sufficiently reliable to properly \nprotect and access classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

It was his first time applying for a security clearance and he made \nmistakes on the security clearance application. He had a difficult time completing the \napplication and no one was very helpful while he was completing it. He actually began \nusing marijuana in 2019. (Tr. 20-21) \nIn May 2019, Applicant and his friend were driving to a concert. The police pulled \nthem over. The police searched his car and discovered 3.5 grams of marijuana in the \ncar.

He also mentioned that he intended to use \nmedical marijuana in the future. (Gov 2 at 7) \nApplicant believed that there was no security issue with using medical marijuana. \nHe did not understand that although his marijuana use was legal under state law, it \nremained illegal under federal law. He was not made aware of this until his family \nmembers, (especially his grandfather) told him that marijuana use remained an issue \nwhen applying for a security clearance. He now understands that marijuana remains \nillegal under federal law. He stopped using marijuana about a month before his medical \nmarijuana card expired (July 2022) because he felt he did not need it anymore. He did \nnot reapply for a medical marijuana card when it expired in August 2022. He now deals \nwith his anxiety by running and fishing. He does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He submitted a statement indicating he will abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. He acknowledged any future involvement or misuse may result in \nthe revocation of his security clearance. (Tr. 23-31; AE B) \nWhole-Person Factors \nMr. J.P. wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has known him for 11 years. He \ndescribes him as hard-working.

B. has been Applicant\u2019s step-grandmother since 2019. She has known \nhim since 2017. She is aware Applicant used marijuana and had a medical card. She \nthought it was a poor decision on his part and marijuana use had no place when \nworking for a defense contractor. In the summer 2022, he assured her that he had \nstopped using marijuana. She has observed a change in his judgment, clarity, and \npresence since that time. She has talked with Applicant about his future and he is \ncommitted to following rules and regulations. \nApplicant occasionally takes his younger siblings on outings and drives them to \nafter school activities. Mrs T.B. describes him as trustworthy and responsible for the \nsafety of the children while in his care.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse;  \nAG \u00b625(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and  \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \nApplicant admits he started using marijuana in 2019. He admits he applied for \nand received a medical marijuana card which was initially granted in 2020. (His recently \nexpired medical marijuana card was granted on August 22, 2021.) While Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use was legal under the state law where he resides, it remained illegal under \nfederal law. Applicant indicated he intended to continue using medical marijuana in \nresponse to section 23 on his March 2022 security clearance application and to an \ninvestigator who interviewed him on March 28, 2022, during his security clearance \nbackground investigation. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant used \nand possessed marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. The Government also \nestablished a prima facie case that Applicant expressed an intent to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. AG \u00b6 25(g) applies. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant stopped using marijuana around July \n2022, approximately one month before his medical marijuana card expired. \nHe \nsincerely believed that there was no issue with him using medical marijuana. He was \nnot aware that marijuana use remained illegal under federal law. Once he was told by \nfamily members, his grandfather in particular, that marijuana use remains illegal under \nfederal law and remains a security concern, he stopped using marijuana. More than 16 \nmonths have passed since he stopped using marijuana. He is focused on building a \nsuccessful career. While initially, he could have used better judgment, once he learned \nthat marijuana remained illegal under federal law he stopped using marijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use and \nsigned a statement of intent indicating he will not use marijuana in the future. He \nacknowledged any future illegal use could result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. Once he learned that medical marijuana use remained illegal under federal \nlaw, he stopped using it and did not renew his medical marijuana card. He has not used \nmarijuana since July 2022. He no longer intends to use marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character references and his years of \nfavorable employment with his employer. I considered his honesty during the security \nclearance process. He admitted he used medical marijuana on his security clearance \napplication and during his background investigation interview. Once he discovered that \nmarijuana use remained illegal under federal law, he stopped using marijuana and has \nabstained from marijuana use for over 16 months. I find Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns under Guideline H. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

He is also aware \nthat any future illegal marijuana use may result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

FS1 filed the first complaint; FS2 filed the second complaint; and \nFS3 filed the third complaint. At the time these complaints were made Applicant and all \nthree of the female sailors were attached to the same Navy ship. FS1 obtained a \nmilitary protection order (MPO) against Applicant in April 2019, and FS2 obtained an \nMPO against Applicant a few days later. FS1 accused Applicant of watching her in the \nfemale berthing area taking a shower in March 2019. FS1 reported this incident a week \nafter it allegedly took place. All three female sailors accused Applicant of unwanted \nsexual touching such as groping their buttocks from June 2018 to March 2019 and \nreported the violations in April 2019. (Tr. 32-33, 57-72, 84; GE 2) \nIn May 2019, Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) interviewed Applicant, \nand he voluntarily provided his cell phone to be examined. During this interview, he was \ninformed of the allegations against him and who made the allegations.

(Tr. 33-34; GE 2) \nIn December 2019, the ship\u2019s legal officer notified Applicant he was being \nawarded NJP, Article 15, UCMJ.

Applicant \nexplained how the AirDrop was accidental. He was unable to call witnesses in support \nof his case because they were no longer on the ship or because of short notice were \nunable to provide supporting statements.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern about sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 provides the following conditions could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). Further review is \nrequired. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

The specific charges, specifications, and findings of the \nNJP and administrative board are discussed, supra. The Article 107 NJP charges were \nnot considered at Applicant\u2019s administration board. The board did not find that Applicant \ncommitted any of the charges and specifications that arose from April 2019 complaints \nfiled by FS1, FS2, and FS3. They did, however, find that Applicant committed two of the \nArticle 92 offenses that occurred approximately one and a half years before the April \n2019 complaints, which he admitted and were handled at the command level. The \nboard found that (1) he made comments of a sexual nature creating hostile work \nenvironment: 3-0 supports allegation; and (2) sexual harassment, sending lewd photo: \n3-0 supports allegation. \nApplicant was not afforded the same level of due process at his NJP as he was \nat his administrative board. At his board, he had counsel and had the opportunity to \nsubmit evidence in a setting in which the evidence was reviewed by three independent \nboard members. The record does not contain any of the NJP proceedings but does \ninclude relevant administrative board proceedings. The Article 92 charges which the \nboard found were substantiated are of limited security significance given they occurred \nwell before the more serious April 2019 complaints. \nAs noted, supra, the administrative separation board did not find by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Applicant committed any of the offenses generated \nby the three complainants in April 2019. Stated differently, the board found that \nApplicant refuted the evidence of the of the three complainants that he engaged in any \nof the disreputable conduct of which he was accused. The basis for the administrative \nseparation board\u2019s conclusion was: (1) NJP admission of guilt (of the offenses that \noccurred before the April 2019 complaints; (2) NCIS interviews; and (3) text messages. \nThe record does not contain any evidence of the deliberative process that BUPERS \nconsidered in not accepting the administrative board\u2019s findings and recommendation. \nThe new evidence I received at Applicant\u2019s hearing were six character letters \nsubmitted by female Navy personnel familiar with him in a supervisory capacity and \nseveral were familiar with the offenses and complainants. I also received his \nperformance evaluations and heard his testimony, which I considered to be credible. \nAny new evidence received after the administrative board separation hearing supported \nthe finding that he did not commit the offenses for which he was found guilty of at NJP. I \ndid not have access to any of Applicant\u2019s records pertaining to his NJP proceedings, his \nNJP appeal, his command\u2019s forwarding endorsement of his administrative discharge \nproceedings, or of any BUPERS correspondence pertaining to their decision to \ndisregard the findings and recommendation of the administration board. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating and contrasting the Applicant\u2019s NJP versus his administrative board \nproceedings, a number of concerns came to light during his hearing: (1) Applicant\u2019s \ncommand arranged for an airline ticket two days before his NJP was adjudicated \ntransferring him off the ship; (2) FS1, FS2, and FS3 did not report the alleged unwanted \nsexual touching they claim occurred between June 2018 to March 2019 until April 2020; \n(3) none of the complaining witness appeared at Applicant\u2019s NJP; (4) given the short \nnotice Applicant was given for his NJP, he was unable to call any witnesses or obtain \nwitness statements; (5) Applicant testified that FS3 recanted her complaint; (6) \nApplicant produced credible alibis that rebutted the times and dates when the alleged \nassaults and shower viewing occurred; (7) a female witness familiar with the \ncomplainants came forward stating that FS1 and FS2 had to \u201cchange their stories so it \nwould make sense\u201d after Applicant  produced his alibis. She added that FS1 and FS2 \nfabricated their stories to get off the ship, and succeeded in doing so; (8) Applicant and \nhis counsel were not notified that his NJP appeal was denied until shortly before his \nadministrative board convened; (9) During Applicant\u2019s administration board, FS1 denied \nthat Applicant came into the female shower, which is contrary to her previous statement; \nand (10) BUPERS chose to discharge Applicant despite the administrative board\u2019s \nfindings and recommendation that he be retained. \nAG \u00b6 14 lists the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nI independently find that Appellant credibly denied the allegations of sexual \nmisconduct which were not substantiated at his separation board. The Article 92 \nallegations that Applicant admitted to, and the board found against him occurred \nseparate and apart from the more serious April 2019 allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) \nfully apply to his comments of a sexual nature creating hostile work environment and \nsexual harassment by sending a lewd photo. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). Further review is \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor reasons discussed supra, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 32(c), and 32(d) fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

My comments \nunder Guidelines D and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old electronics technician seeking a Secret security \nclearance. He successfully held a clearance during his ten years plus in the Navy. Until \nhis NJP and administrative board, his Navy career was on an upward trajectory. This is \namply documented by his performance evaluations and character letters. His former \nsupervisors and shipmates emphasized his attributes of patriotism, morality, and \njudgment especially with regard to safeguarding classified and sensitive information. \nApplicant has continued his post-Navy career in support of the national defense. He is \nmarried to a Navy petty officer and has two minor children. \nApplicant\u2019s command had no choice but to investigate and pursue diligently the \nreported allegations of sexual misconduct by three complainants. His command \nultimately awarded him NJP based on the information they had and the guidance they \nreceived. As noted, refusing NJP and demanding a court-martial is not an option \navailable to servicemembers attached to or embarked on a vessel. The NJP did not go \nwell for Applicant, and he was found guilty of all charges and specifications. Flight \narrangements had been made two days before his NJP to transfer him off his ship \nimmediately following NJP. After arriving at the shore command where his ship was \nhomeported, the shore command convened an administrative separation board to \nprocess him for separation. Being represented by counsel and having greater due \nprocess, Applicant fared substantially better at his board. \nFor reasons unknown, \nBUPERS overruled the board\u2019s findings and \nrecommendation and discharged Applicant with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. Various facts evolved throughout the proceedings to include a witness \nfamiliar with the three complainants coming forward and discrediting their motives and \nstatement, one of the complaining witnesses recanted her statement, and another of the \ncomplaining witnesses altered her testimony before the board denying her statement \nthat he came into the female shower area. In short, as the underlying facts of this rather \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \ncomplex case evolved, Applicant refuted most of the allegations and successfully \nmitigated the two allegations that were substantiated. \nI independently conclude and concur with the administration board\u2019s findings. In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. In doing so, I had the benefit of \nreviewing evidence that was not available at Applicant\u2019s NJP hearing but was available \nat his administration board except as noted, supra. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge in his Answer. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 8, 2022. The case was \nassigned to me on November 18, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on November 28, 2022. The case was heard on \nJanuary 18, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses, \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through F, which were also admitted without objection. \nThe record remained open for the receipt of additional documentation. The Government \noffered Government Exhibit 4 on January 19, 2023, which was admitted without objection. \nApplicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits G through L on February 3, 2023, which \nwere all admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nJanuary 27, 2023. The record closed on February 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 41 years old and married with two children. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor (Company A) since March \n2020 as a release engineer and is attempting to obtain a security clearance in relation to \nhis employment. (Tr. 35-36; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant \nExhibit A.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he abuses intoxicants to excess. He denied both allegations in this paragraph \nwith explanations. \nApplicant has worked consistently as a software engineer since graduating from \ncollege in 2006. He worked for Company B, a major IT company, from February 2015 to \nMarch 2020. Up through 2017 his work was exemplary, and his evaluations stated he \n\u201cmeets all expectations.\u201d Beginning in 2018, however, he began receiving marginal \nevaluations. He stated that at this point in time he began to use alcohol and marijuana to \ncope with job stress. His actions did not relieve the job stress. By early 2019 he was \nhaving serious emotional problems due to job and home stress, and the impact of his \nincreased alcohol and marijuana use. This description of his use is attested to by both \nApplicant and his wife.

While worthwhile, he did not feel that he \nhad received sufficient treatment to resolve his issues. Accordingly, he received an \nadditional 60 days of outpatient treatment. He feels that the treatment was successful. \n(Tr. 16-18, 22. 28-30, 37, 61, 73-74; Applicant Exhibit D.) \nSoon after returning to Company B after his three-month leave of absence \nApplicant received a job offer from Company A. As stated, he began working there in \nearly 2020. He testified that he enjoys the work and finds it very fulfilling. His evaluations \nat this job have been outstanding, according to his current and former supervisors. (Tr. \n75-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2, 6.) \nThe programs Applicant attended recommended that he not drink alcohol. He did \nnot drink alcohol for several months after finishing his program. He eventually began to \ndrink again and continued to drink some amount of alcohol several times a week until \nNovember 2022. At that point he made the decision to stop drinking altogether and began \nattending a recovery program. He testified that the program is assisting him in his \nrecovery. (Tr. 18-19, 42-46, 62, 68-70; Applicant Exhibits J and K.) \nApplicant continues to experience stress, even in the new job. He began seeing a \npsychiatric nurse practitioner (PNP) in January 2022 due to depression and anxiety. In \nMay 2022 the therapist reported, \u201cPatient [Applicant] states that he stayed sober for \nseveral days, but then would binge drink on a bottle of whiskey or pack of beer at a sitting. \nPatient continues to report cravings for alcohol.\u201d (Tr. 63-65; Government Exhibit 4 at 4; \nApplicant Exhibit I at 2.) \nApplicant Exhibit I has additional treatment notes from September 2022 at page 2. \nThe PNP stated: \nPatient [Applicant] remained on Pristiq, no longer taking naltrexone. States \nthat it worked well at first, then it seemed to stop working for etoh [alcohol] \ncravings. Has had some nights where he drank more than he desired, but \nnot getting overly intoxicated. Feeling much better with mood, denies any \ndown days like he used to have. [Reports] working full time, busy with \nfamily. Some anxiety with life stress \u2013 able to tolerate. \nApplicant testified that he does not feel he currently has a problem with alcohol. \nHe further testified that he never told the therapist that he engaged in binge drinking. He \nadmitted drinking a fifth of whiskey within three days. He did make an arrangement with \nhis wife that she would tell him if she felt that he was drinking too much. She did tell him \nseveral times about excessive drinking last year up to about August 2022. (Tr. 23-26, 44-\n45, 47-48, 66-68, 70-71.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received an evaluation from a DoD psychological consultant (Dr. One). \nHis report is dated July 6, 2022, and is Government Exhibit 3. (Tr. 46-47.) That report\nstated the following: \n \nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The Subject [Applicant] was referred for \nevaluation to determine if he meets criteria for any condition which would \njeopardize his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. Specifically, his \nhistory of marijuana and alcohol use was of concern. Based upon the \nincreased frequency and amount used prior to his voluntary admission to \ntreatment, the Subject likely met criteria for an alcohol use disorder and a \ncannabis use disorder. He currently does not appear to meet criteria for the \nmarijuana use disorder since his reported abstinence during the application \nprocess for his current position in early 2020. However, according to his \ncurrent medical records, Subject continues to suffer from alcohol cravings \nand engages in binge drinking to cope with work stress despite his stated \ndesire to be sober. Personal restraint has not appeared to be sufficient to \ncurb his consumption behaviors and he was most recently prescribed \nNaltroxone to mitigate cravings. As such, it appears that the diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder is still current and applicable to the Subject\u2019s profile. \nThe diagnoses below attempt to capture the Subject\u2019s present level of \nfunctioning. \nDIAGNOSIS: \nAlcohol use disorder, moderate \n(F10.20) \nUnspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress \n(F32.9) \nCannabis use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission \n(F12.20) \nPROGNOSIS: The Subject\u2019s prior history of alcohol and marijuana use and \nsubsequent treatment raised concerns over the Subject\u2019s ability to have \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Having an active diagnosis \nof either would bring inherent risk to those factors. The evaluation did not \nreveal that the Subject is suffering from any ongoing marijuana use. If his \nreporting of abstinence is accurate, then it is not likely a risk factor and can \nbe dismissed as a matter of consideration. However, the information from \nhis current prescriber indicated that he still struggles with binge drinking, \ncravings, and has difficulty staying sober. His consumption appears to be \nfor similar reasons now as it was when he submitted himself for voluntary \ntreatment (ie. [sic] work reviews). This information indicates that the \nSubject\u2019s alcohol use disorder is current, without a sustained period of \nabstinence, and therefore represents an inherent risk to his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was also evaluated by a psychologist (Dr. Two), who was retained by \nApplicant. (Tr. 48-49.) He submitted a report dated December 5, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit \nE.) That report stated: \nConclusion: \n[Applicant] has enjoyed mild to moderate drinking of beer and whiskey for \nmuch of his adult life. It became a problem for him three years ago, when \nhis drinking increased, and combined with cannabis use, sleep deprivation \n(due to his youngest child having sleep problems and requiring care at \nnight) and stress at work, he developed a mood disorder for which he \nsought and received successful treatment. It is unlikely that this mood \ndisorder (Substance Induced Mood Disorder) will reoccur. He sleeps well, \nhis child is doing well, he no longer smokes marijuana, and his work \nsituation has dramatically improved. \nTreatment three years ago was successful. He has learned to maintain \nregular mild to moderate use of alcohol. He currently drinks mildly, between \none and three times a week, on or two drinks on each occasion. To have a \ndiagnosed alcohol condition, a person must meet at last two of eleven \ncriteria over the last twelve months. The only sign that [Applicant] shows \nare occasional cravings, his drinking has never affected any important life \nfunctions, and he has never developed tolerance or suffered withdrawal \nsymptoms. Mild to moderate alcohol consumption, without any other \nchallenges, is not an alcohol problem and does not cause other difficulties. \nDr. Two submitted an Addendum dated January 20, 2023. (Applicant Exhibit G.) \nIt states: \nI would like to clarify that I reviewed that entire record, including notes from \n[PNP] [Applicant Exhibit I). In February 2022, she noted that alcohol use \nwas not affecting any significant life function. In May 2022, she noted \nincreased alcohol use, that again did not affect work or any other important \nlife functions. This does not qualify as a disorder. At this time, she also used \nthe term binge drink, which is incorrect, as [Applicant] emphatically states \nthat this was incorrect, that he would not drink an entire bottle in one sitting, \nbut over the course of several days. In September 2022, she also reported \nsome alcohol use, again not affecting work, relationships or any other \nimportant life skill. Throughout her record, she reports that medication \nhelped him maintain his mood. I stand by my impression that he has never \nqualified as having an alcohol disorder based on the DSM 5 definition. \nThough he drinks sometimes to excess, this is at home, not at work, does \nnot affect his relationships, work or any other life function, he is not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \ndependent, has never developed withdrawal symptoms, has never missed \nwork due to alcohol use, does not currently experience cravings. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible \nfor access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair \nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He denied SOR 2.a. He admitted in part and \ndenied in part SOR 2.b. He denied SOR 2.c. \nSOR paragraph 2.a. references Applicant\u2019s receiving mental health treatment as \npart of the factual statement. Paragraph 27 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which \nsets forth the concern under this guideline, states in pertinent part, \u201cNo negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.\u201d In addition, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nfactsheet, \u201cMental Health and Security Clearances,\u201d states in part, \u201cSeeking mental health \nservices does not affect one\u2019s ability to gain or hold security eligibility. Adjudicators regard \nseeking necessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance \nprocess.\u201d (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Mental Health and Security \nClearances, https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/ pv/DODCAF/resources/DCSA-\nFactSheet Mental-Health SecurityClearances-Oct21.pdf \n(accessed \nSeptember \n5, \n2023.) \n2.a. There is little to no support for the allegation that Applicant has been \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder. The only evidence is an affirmative statement by him in \nanswer to Section 21 \u201cPsychological and Emotional Health\u201d on Government Exhibit 1 that \nasked whether he had \u201cEVER been diagnosed by a physician . . . with . . . bipolar mood \ndisorder.\u201d He stated that he answered the question this way because of a statement made \nto him by one of his therapists during his first 30-day outpatient treatment that some of \nhis conduct could indicate a bipolar disorder. However, there is no diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder found anywhere in the available medical records. He testified that both Dr. One \nand Dr. Two stated they did not believe Applicant suffered from a bipolar disorder. \n(Government Exhibit 1; Tr. 20, 49-52.) \n2.b. Applicant admitted, and the available medical records confirm, that he suffers \nfrom depression and anxiety. He is receiving therapy for it, and is also on medication. He \nfurther stated that therapy and medication are helping control his depression and anxiety. \nHe is also attempting to obtain additional individual therapy with a psychologist. He is \ncurrently on a waitlist for this provider.

The Government alleged that Doctor One\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant as currently \nsuffering from Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate, is cognizable under this guideline as well. \nApplicant denied this allegation. \nMitigation \nApplicant has been a successful employee at Company A. His current supervisor \ntestified and supplied a letter on his behalf. He has known Applicant since 2015 at \nCompany A and Company B, and has been his supervisor at both companies for more \nthan three years. He described Applicant as a \u201cgreat\u201d employee. He further testified that \nhe has not seen any evidence of alcohol or mental health issues with Applicant. He further \nstated that he has entrusted Applicant with large projects and stated he trusts Applicant \nnot to reveal classified or proprietary data. (Tr. 77-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 6.) \nAnother supervisor of Applicant\u2019s at both Company A and Company B submitted \na very laudatory letter on his behalf. He described Applicant as having \u201cthe highest \nintegrity.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2.) \nPeer feedback from fellow employees of Company A in 2022 was extremely \nfavorable. (Tr. 56-59; Applicant Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol use, including binge drinking, which \ncontinued through November 2022. He was diagnosed by a DoD mental health consultant \nwith Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate in July 2022. He received treatment for a mood \ndisorder in 2019, which included a recommendation that he not consume alcohol. All three \nof the cited disqualifying conditions apply, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nNone of these mitigating conditions was sufficiently established by the evidence in \nthis case. Applicant has had a problem with alcohol for several years. He took a three-\nmonth leave of absence from his job in 2019 to obtain mental health treatment for stress, \nwhich included excessive alcohol use. He admitted that he still uses alcohol as a means \nto self-medicate during times of stress or depression through late 2022. I have considered \nall the medical records contained in this case and have incorporated them in my findings. \nInsufficient time has passed since Applicant stopped drinking. A finding on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf cannot be made at this point in time. Guideline G is found against Applicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may be applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nWith regard to Guideline I, no adverse inference has been drawn because of \nApplicant\u2019s obtaining mental health treatment or his hospitalizations. Specifically, AG \u00b6 \n28(c) is not applicable to this case. \nAs stated above, there is no direct evidence that Applicant has ever been \ndiagnosed with a bipolar disorder. Accordingly, based on the available record, SOR 2.a \nis found for Applicant. \nTurning to the other two allegations. The record shows that Applicant has been \nsuffering from chronic depression and stress for years. In addition, he was diagnosed by \na DoD mental health consultant as having a current diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder, \nModerate. AG \u00b6 28(a) applies to this case. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn 2022 a DoD mental health consultant found that Applicant had a condition that \nmay impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nThe Government has met its burden under the Directive to establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Four of them have possible application to this case: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nSOR 2.b. As stated, Applicant has been suffering with depression and stress for \nmany years. He is undergoing treatment and by all indications the depression is controlled \nwith therapy and medication. There is no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), \n(b), and (e) apply. This allegation is found for Applicant. \nSOR 2.c. My discussion under Guideline G applies to this particular allegation. AG \n\u00b6 29(b) minimally applies because Applicant has recently entered a recovery program. \nHowever, as stated above insufficient time has passed to make a finding that he has \nresolved his alcohol issues. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because there is not a current mental health finding that \nthe previous condition is under control or in remission and has a low possibility of \nrecurrence or exacerbation. I have considered the statements by both psychologists. I do \nnot find Doctor Two\u2019s analysis sufficient to overcome that of Doctor One under the \ncircumstances of this case. \nApplicant is highly commended for all he has done to improve his mental health \nover the years. However, the strictures of the Guidelines as written require more from \nApplicant in terms of consistency of treatment and a current and favorable prognosis that \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrebuts the current report by the Government\u2019s mental health consultant. Given the current \nstate of the record I cannot find that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by the evidence in this case. Guideline I is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has made strides in \nresolving his mental health issues, and related alcohol issues. However, the present \nrecord evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September \n22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the Guideline H allegations, with explanations, in his answer \nand denied the Guideline E allegations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of \nfact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a defense \ncontractor. He works in information technology. He has worked for defense contractors \nsince 2015 and has held a secret clearance since 2016. He holds an associate degree. \nHe is married, has two children, and was expecting a third child at the time of his \nhearing. (Tr. at 6, 20-22; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used and purchased marijuana. It further alleged he \nused and purchased marijuana from November 2015 to about August 2016, while \ngranted access to classified information. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) It also alleged he falsified \ninformation in response to two questions on his March 2022 security clearance \napplication (SCA) when he failed to disclose his marijuana use, as alleged above. The \nmarijuana use allegations were also cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2a-2.c) \nApplicant testified that he experimented with marijuana while in high school. In \n2015, he was hired by a defense contractor located in another state (State A). He and \nhis family moved to State A to take the job. At the time of his move, State A had \nlegalized the use of marijuana and the purchase of marijuana from state-licensed \ndispensaries. Sometime in 2015, he completed an SCA (this document was not put into \nevidence) with the assistance of his facility security officer (FSO). He described this \nprocess as him being on the telephone with his FSO, answering the FSO\u2019s questions \nfrom the SCA, and the FSO taking those answers and inputting them into the SCA \nonline computer program. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions about whether he used \nany illegal substances. He did this because he believed his use of marijuana in 2015 \nwas not illegal because it was allowed under State A\u2019s law. He was unaware that use, \npossession, and purchasing of marijuana was in violation of federal law. He does not \nrecall receiving any information from his employer or FSO that marijuana use was \nprohibited by federal law. (Nothing about falsifying his 2015 SCA was alleged in the \nSOR, so I will not use that information for disqualifying purposes. However, I may \nconsider it for credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors).

His program \nmanager told him to stop using marijuana, but otherwise not to worry about it. Applicant \nhas not used, purchased, or possessed marijuana since told to stop doing so in \napproximately August 2016. While he worked in a cleared environment, he never \nhandled classified information during this time period. (Tr. 23-25, 40; SOR answer; AE \nA, p.6) \nIn March 2022, Applicant was selected by his employer to apply for a top secret \nclearance. This required him to complete a new SCA, which he did on March 25, 2022. \nDuring the process of completing his SCA, he contemplated the drug-related questions: \n\u201cIn the last seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances? and \u201cHave you ever illegally used . . . a controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance . . . .\u201d He answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. Before \ncompleting his answers, he testified that he sought guidance from his FSO about how to \nanswer the questions because he was not sure if his last marijuana use was within the \nseven-year timeframe. Applicant did not address the difference in the nature of the \nquestions. The first asking if he used within the last seven years and the second asking \nif he ever used. His FSO told him to \u201cdo his best\u201d in completing the SCA and address \nany questions he had in the follow-up interview with an investigator. He also asked his \nsenior colleagues about how he should answer the questions and they agreed with the \nFSO that he should address any questions or ambiguities during his follow-up interview. \nApplicant denied that he intentionally provided false information on his SCA. (Tr. 25-27, \n37; GE 1; AE A, p. 6) \nIn May 2022, Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation. \nThe written summary of this investigation appears at GE 2. Applicant disputed some of \nthe characterizations made by the interviewer and noted them in an email to \nDepartment Counsel (AE A, pp. 3-4) in August 2023. Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana in the last seven years to the investigator without first being confronted with \nknowledge of his prior use. He further explained the circumstances of his use and his \nignorance of federal law prohibiting use of marijuana until his enlightenment in \napproximately August 2016. Appellant disagrees with the investigator\u2019s characterization \nthat Applicant said he did not know why he did not list his marijuana use on his SCA. He \nmaintains that he told the investigator about his confusion concerning the seven-year \nwindow to report drug use and he was not sure whether his situation required reporting. \nHe decided to wait to ask clarifying questions when he spoke to the investigator, which \nhe did. Overall, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony and explanations credible. (Tr. 26, 37-38; \nGE 2; SOR answer; AE A, pp. 3-4) \nApplicant submitted a letter from a friend who has rented a room from him for \napproximately 10 years. The friend stated that he has not witnessed Applicant use \nmarijuana since 2016. Applicant also submitted a written statement of intent not to use \nmarijuana or THC products in the future, that such use could result in the revocation of \nhis clearance, and that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. Applicant\u2019s wife does \nnot use marijuana or THC products.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2015 to sometime in 2016. Although he held a \nsecurity clearance at the time, there is no evidence that he had access to classified \ninformation. The evidence is to the contrary based on his testimony that he did not \nhandle classified information, which went unrebutted by the Government. I find that AG \n\u00b6 25(a) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, however, without the \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information\u201d language established here, those two allegations become \nduplicitous. I find in favor on Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred approximately seven years ago. He \ncredibly testified that he immediately stopped using marijuana upon learning it was \nillegal under federal law. There is no evidence of more recent use. He acknowledged \nhis drug use and took action to change his behavior by ceasing all use of marijuana. He \nalso provided a signed statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here supports mitigation in the form of Applicant\u2019s abstinence since 2016 \nand his signed letter of intent of nonuse in the future. The guidance also states that \nviolation of federal drug law remains relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. (See ES 2021-01529) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .; \nApplicant did not list his 2015-2016 marijuana use on his 2022 SCA. He credibly \nstated that his intent was not to deceive the government about his past drug activity. \nRather, he was legitimately confused about his reporting responsibilities because of the \nambiguity that existed in his mind about whether his last use was within the past seven \nyears. While this does not apply to the \u201cever used\u201d question of SOR \u00b6 2.b, his response \nto both of these questions was confused by the guidance he sought from his FSO and \nother senior colleague as to how to answer them. He was advised to address any \nambiguities he had about the questions with his background investigator, which he did. \nThus, I find that while he deliberately answered both questions incorrectly, he did so \nwithout an intent to deceive, but with an intent to clarify the answers with the \ninvestigator. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is sufficient under Guideline H, as noted above. AG \n\u00b6 16(c) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 2.c. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, before his reporting of \nit, was a source of vulnerability to exploitation and could affect his professional standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that he was confused about his reporting \nresponsibility when he was completing his 2022 SCA. He was advised by both his FSO \nand his senior colleagues to address any questions or ambiguities with his background \ninvestigator during his upcoming interview. He did so by telling the investigator all the \ncircumstances of his prior marijuana use and his confusion over the applicability of \nfederal law and the seven-year reporting window. He was not confronted by the \ninvestigator about his prior drug use before he reported it in response to a general \nquestion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b. \nApplicant admitted his past marijuana use and credibly testified about his nearly \nseven years of abstinence. He immediately ceased using marijuana when he was made \naware of its illegality under federal law. He provided a written statement of intent not to \nuse in the future. I conclude that any future drug use is unlikely to occur. AG \u00b6 17(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 2.c \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E. Those factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nthose guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has lived at his current residence since 2005. He started with his current employer in April 2008 and is a technician. (GX 3, 10-11) The SOR alleges 15 delinquent federal student loans totaling $44,672 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) and one delinquent medical account totaling $469 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o and denied SOR \u00b6 1.p with explanations.

Applicant received the \nFORM on November 11, 2022, and did not provide a response. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 24, 2023. The SOR and the Answer \n(GX 1-2) are the pleadings in the case. GX 3 through GX 11 are admitted without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old, married and has two adult children. From October 2002 \nthrough June 2004, he attended college and earned an associate degree. He has lived \nat his current residence since 2005. He started with his current employer in April 2008 \nand is a technician. (GX 3, 10-11) \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent federal student loans totaling $44,672 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.o) and one delinquent medical account totaling $469 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o and denied SOR \u00b6 1.p with explanations. In addition to \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the debts are established by Applicant\u2019s April 2017, March 2021 \nand June 2022 credit reports. (GX 1-2, 6-8) \nApplicant explained that he took out student loans to fund his college education \nfrom 2002 through 2004. The loans came out of deferment in late 2004, but he could \nnot afford to make the minimum payment of $900 each month. He stated that from late \n2004 through early 2017, he made no payment on his student loans. (GX 2-4, 10-11) \nApplicant stated that, during this time, he made multiple attempts to complete a \nrepayment plan through the Department of Education (DOE) website. On each \noccasion, the website calculated a monthly repayment that was 2.5 times greater than \nhis mortgage. He stated he then called DOE on three separate occasions and \nrequested that a repayment application be mailed to him. However, he claimed he never \nreceived the paperwork. He did not provide further detail as to the proposed payment \nplans, what dates he contacted DOE or what additional efforts he undertook to resolve \nthese delinquent accounts prior to 2017. (GX 2-4, 10-11) \nIn May 2017, DOE issued a wage garnishment order to Applicant\u2019s employer and \nlisted the amount due as $71,861. Applicant\u2019s April 2017 credit report reflected a \ndelinquent student loan balance of about $57,319. The record is unclear as to the \nreasons for the balance difference. At the time, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was about \n$53,000, paid bi-weekly. The involuntary wage garnishment was calculated at $211 per \npay period, beginning in June 2017. (GX 4, 9) \nOnce the garnishment was initiated, Applicant took no action to establish a \npayment plan with DOE or otherwise bring his loans into good standing. He stated he \nchose to allow the garnishment to continue as a way to repay the debt and not cause \nfinancial burden to his family since it was a payment he could afford.

A comparison of Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflects that \nhis delinquent student loan balance decreased from $57,319 to $44,672 during this \ntime. (GX 2, 8-9, 11) \nIn about March 2020, the wage garnishment was suspended as part of \nCOVID-19 relief efforts. Applicant\u2019s April 2022 earnings statement does not show \npayments toward the garnishment. In his May 2022 Response to Interrogatories, \nApplicant stated that the garnishment remained suspended and he had not issued any \nother payment on his student loans. He anticipated that the garnishment would renew \nonce the COVID-19 relief efforts terminated. (GX 2, 4) \nIn his October 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant did not specify whether any \nadditional payments had occurred on the student loans since the garnishment was \nsuspended and he did not provide any detailed history of payments. However, he \nrestated that he will allow the garnishment to proceed in order to repay the debt in a \nway that does not cause a financial burden. (GX 2) \nWith regard to the delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.p), Applicant did not \ndisclose the debt in his February 2021 SCA or recognize it during his March 2021 \nsecurity clearance background interview. However, with his Answer, he provided a \nstatement from the collection agency showing that the debt had been paid in full shortly \nafter his interview. (GX 2) \nOutside of the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has no additional \ndelinquent debts. An April 2022 earnings statement shows that he had an annual salary \nof about $75,000. In May 2022, he submitted a budget that confirmed his salary and \nreflected that, after paying his monthly obligations, he maintained a net remainder of \nabout $1,800 per month. That budget did not include any payment toward his student \nloans. (GX 4, 8) \nApplicant stated that his intent was to take care of all of his financial issues \nresponsibility. He further stated that he was able to live within his means and described \nhis financial situation as \u201cgreat.\u201d (GX 2, 11) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes three conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that, from late 2004 through \nearly 2017, he issued no payments toward his delinquent student loans. He described \nan inability to pay on his student loans in 2004 because of financial difficulties. \nHowever, even after securing his current employment in 2008, he continued to take no \nsubstantive action to bring his student loans into good standing. Evidence reflects that \nthe student loans remain in collection status with involuntarily payments only occurring \nafter the issuance of a wage garnishment order in 2017. He also has an additional \naccount in collection status. All of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. \nThere are three pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans came out of deferment in late 2004. He claimed he did \nnot initially pay on his student loans because he could not afford the payment. While it is \npossible that he struggled financially while initially entering the workforce, he did not \nexplain how those possible struggles prevented him from making any payments on his \nloans over the next thirteen years. Instead, outside of a few unspecified efforts to \nestablish a payment plan, he took no action on his student loans until forced to do so by \nthe wage garnishment order in 2017. \nFollowing the 2017 garnishment, Applicant took no action to bring his student \nloans into good standing. About three years later, following the COVID-19 suspension of \nthe garnishment, he again took no action to further address his student loans. Instead, \nhe is content to allow the garnishment to eventually resume. \nIt is noted that, since the garnishment was initiated in 2017, Applicant\u2019s balance \non the loans has decreased by about $12,650. However, when considering the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, even when delinquent debts are being paid, the \nadministrative judge must evaluate the totality of the evidence and consider the \ncircumstances of the underlying debts for what they may reveal about an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 3 (App. Bd. July 5, 2017) \nSatisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor's garnishment \nis not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor. ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Court-ordered or otherwise \ninvoluntary means of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight \nthan means initiated and carried through by the debtor himself. ISCR Case No. 17-\n04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) Similarly, the fact that an applicant\u2019s student loans \nare in a deferment status does not excuse an applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) \nNone of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are fully applicable to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o. Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans are long-standing, ongoing, \nand cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It took \nApplicant nearly thirteen years to begin issuing payments on his delinquent student \nloans, and he only did so through an involuntary garnishment. While the balance of the \ndelinquent student loan debt has reduced through payments under the garnishment, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthose payments alone do not establish good-faith effort, especially when compared to \nthe years of inaction that occurred before and since the garnishment was ordered. The \nCOVID-19 suspension of the garnishment was a condition beyond his control. However, \nboth before and after the suspension, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), and 20(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant learned of this \ndelinquent medical account during his security clearance background interview. That \nsame month he took action to resolve the debt through payment. \nThrough garnishment, Applicant\u2019s student loan debt has decreased. However, \nthe debt reduction alone does not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd.

On June 14, \n2023, the case was assigned to me. On July 18, 2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for August 17, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled using a \nvideo-teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection.

The record was \nheld open until August 31, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He timely \nsubmitted two documents which were admitted as AE L - M, without objection.

Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nProcedural Issue \nDuring the hearing, the Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.a pursuant to \nDirective paragraph E3.1.17, as follows: \nb. You are indebted to the Federal government for unpaid taxes for tax year \n2017 in the approximate amount of $3,637.02. As of the date of the \nStatement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid.  \nThe amendment was approved without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and admitted \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional \nfindings follow. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2006. He started at his current \nemployer in July 2023. He worked for several other contractors prior to his current \nposition. He is a high school graduate and has some college credits. He married in 2014, \nbut separated from his spouse in 2016. He has no children. (Tr. 22-24; Gov 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his state and Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016 to 2020.

(SOR \u00b6 1.b: \nGov 2 at 13-14) Applicant disclosed on his SCA, dated October 28, 2020, that he had not \nfiled federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Gov \n1, Section 26, at 73-74) On December 29, 2021, he provided additional information about \nthe status of his federal and state tax returns in response to DOHA Interrogatories. In his \nresponse he indicated he had not filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2016 \u2013 \n2020, because he was waiting for his federal tax returns to be completed. He did not want \nto create a financial hardship by owing both at the same time. He also provided copies of \nfederal tax transcripts for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  (Gov 2)  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that he filed his taxes through tax \nyear 2021. He said the IRS has a severe back log. The last update he received from the \nIRS was that tax years 2016 - 2018 were processed. They are working on the 2019 taxes \nand cannot process later years until it is complete. Applicant states the tax debt incurred \nin 2017 should be resolved once the refunds from unprocessed tax returns are applied to \nthe debt. If he still owes taxes after the income tax returns are processed, he will be able \nto pay the balance. (Answer to SOR) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted to being aware that federal income tax \nreturns were required to be filed by April 15th  of each year. He states he stopped filing his \nfederal and state income tax returns in 2016 because he was going through a difficult \nperiod during his separation from his spouse. He did not handle things responsibly. His \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns created a bigger problem. He \nhad difficulty finding his W-2s. (Tr. 25-26)  \nApplicant started to file his late income tax returns on his own in 2020, after he\nsubmitted his SCA. Some of the returns were accepted. Some were not. The IRS found\nissues with the 2019 federal income tax return so he had to amend his return. In February\n2023, he hired a tax professional to help with amending his 2017 and 2019 federal and\nstate income tax returns. He believes once his amended 2017 federal income tax return\nis processed, the balance of taxes owed for 2017 will be completely resolved or\nsignificantly reduced. Applicant owed $8,121.02 in unpaid taxes for tax year 2017.\nRefunds from tax years 2018, 2020, and 2021 were applied to the 2017 tax debt. The\ncurrent balance owed for the 2017 tax debt is $3,637.02 (Tr. 20-21, 36-38; AE H; AE I)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 23, 2023, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS for \nthe 2017 federal tax debt. He agreed to a monthly payment of $161 via direct deposit \nuntil the debt is resolved. He made his first payment on August 1, 2023. He will pay it off \nsooner when the refund from his 2019 tax return is applied to the 2017 federal tax debt. \n(Tr. 26-31, AE J) Once his amended 2017 federal income tax return is processed and \naccepted, he believes he will receive a refund of $4,011. \nThe current status of the federal and state income tax returns and any balances \nowed are as follows: \n2016 Federal and State Income Tax Returns: Applicant filed his 2016 federal \nincome tax return on June 14, 2021.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2016 \u2013 2020. He owes approximately $3,637 in federal income taxes for tax year 2017. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admits he stopped filing his federal and state income tax returns in 2016 \nbecause he had a difficult time dealing with his marital separation. This is considered a \ncircumstance beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. However, it is given less \nweight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe neglected to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes for more than four \nyears. He was aware he was required to file them on an annual basis, but neglected to \ndo so. It is noted that while he filed federal income tax returns for tax years 2021 and \n2022, both returns were filed late. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s federal income returns for tax years \n2016 through 2020. He filed his federal income tax returns in 2021. They were late, but \nthey were filed. The IRS contacted him about issues with his 2019 federal income tax \nreturn in December 2021. He had not resolved these issues at the date of the hearing. \nAfter the hearing, he consulted a professional tax preparer who helped him prepare \namended returns for 2017 and 2019. Applicant entered into a repayment plan related to \nhis 2017 federal tax debt. He made his first payment on August 1, 2023. The 2017 tax \ndebt has been reduced by applying his federal tax refunds for tax years 2018, 2020, and \n2021 to the debt. Applicant is confident the debt will be resolved once the refund for tax \nyear 2019 is applied to the balance owed for the 2017 tax year. \nApplicant did not provide documentary proof that his state income tax returns were \nfiled for tax years 2016 and 2018. The record was held open to allow him to contact the \nstate comptroller\u2019s office to acquire documentation about the status of his state income \ntax returns for the years in question. Applicant claims the state would only provide status \nabout his state income tax returns verbally over the phone. He claims they said the only \nyear that was outstanding was tax year 2017. He recently amended this return and is \nexpected to receive a refund. Absent corroborating documentary evidence, this is not \nsufficient for me to conclude that all the state income tax returns have been filed. \nApplicant receives some credit for finally filing his federal and state tax returns \n(with the exception of his 2016 and 2018 state income tax returns), however, any credit \nis minimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. The DOHA Appeal Board has \nheld that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this case, Applicant did not file his late federal and state income tax returns until \nafter he submitted his SCA. He did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his friends.

He has sufficient financial resources to pay his debts, \nincluding his taxes. The only area of concern under financial considerations is his history \nof failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n2020. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four tax years at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his federal and state income tax returns in the context of his \neligibility for access to classified information. His actions under the Appeal Board \njurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

(Government \nExhibit (GE) 1). On November 7, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H.

(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence; Applicant offered 12 \nexhibits into evidence; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted \ninto evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 11, 19-23; GE 1-GE 3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE L) On \nMay 1, 2023, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.

(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.  \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior manager. (Tr. 26) She has been employed since \n2001 working for two DOD contractors. (Tr. 23-25) She received four promotions from her \nfirst DOD employer. (Tr. 26) She has been married for 17 years, and she has one seven-\nyear-old child. (Tr. 24) She has not served in the military. (Tr. 54) In 1997, she graduated \nfrom high school. (Tr. 54) In 2001, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \ninformation systems. (Tr. 24, 54) She was awarded master\u2019s degrees in business \nadministration and information management. (Tr. 25) Her resume provides additional \ninformation about her employment history and background. (Tr. 25-26; GE 1; AE A)  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana and took gummies enhanced with \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with varying frequency from about August 1999 to about July \n2021. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges she used marijuana and took gummies enhanced with THC with \nvarying frequency from about September 2012 to about July 2021, after being granted \naccess to classified information. \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 11, 2022 SCA, she said \u201cI used marijuana a few times over \nthe last seven years in a recreational setting. I have smoked marijuana a few times and \ntaken gummies enhanced with THC. I would estimate use at 10 or less times in the last \n7 years.\u201d (GE 1 at 29) In her March 31, 2022 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interview (PSI) she said: \n[She] admits that she did not think about her security clearance the few \ntimes that she used marijuana. She didn\u2019t actively use her clearance at [that] \ntime and did not think about it. [She] has no future intent to use marijuana. \nShe understands that using marijuana while possessing a security \nclearance is not allowed and could result in termination.

(Tr. 42-43) She \nstopped using marijuana before she was hired by a DOD contractor in 2001. (Tr. 43) She \nwas tested for illegal drug use before she was hired. (Tr. 44) The DOD contractor\u2019s policy \nwas employees were not allowed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work. \n(Tr. 43) She was never drug tested after the DOD contractor employed her. (Tr. 44) She \ndid not use illegal drugs from 2001 to 2012. (Tr. 45) \nIn 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance because her employer believed \nshe might need it in the future. (Tr. 31) She said she did not use marijuana in the previous \nseven years on her 2012 SCA. (Tr. 34) In 2012, she did not have access to classified \ninformation. (Tr. 31) About two months after her security clearance was approved, she \nwas transferred to a different state, and she did not need a security clearance. (Tr. 32) \nShe never used marijuana while having access to classified information. (Tr. 32) She \nunderstood that she was not permitted to use marijuana while she had a security \nclearance. (Tr. 34) She used marijuana a few times from 2012 to 2014, which was after \nshe completed her 2012 SCA. (Tr. 45) Although she did not have access to classified \ninformation, she used marijuana after her security clearance was granted. (Tr. 46) She \ndid not believe her employment while working for the DOD contractor was \u201csensitive\u201d \nemployment. (Tr. 52-53) Her annual pay in 2020 was about $135,000, and she supervised \nemployees working on some important DOD contracts involving weapons systems. (Tr. \n53) As to whether her employment is sensitive, she said it depends on how the term \n\u201csensitive\u201d is defined. (Tr. 54)   \nApplicant used marijuana two or three times between 2015 and July 2021. (Tr. 34, \n38, 51) However, later she said she did not use marijuana from January 2014 through \nOctober 2017. (Tr. 49; GE 1) She ended her association with the people with whom she \nused marijuana, except for her husband who continues to use marijuana. (Tr. 35-37) She \nhas used marijuana with him in the past. (Tr. 50) He does not use marijuana in her home \nor in her presence. (Tr. 37-38) She did not advise her facility security officer of her \nmarijuana use because she was not accessing classified information. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in July 2021 because she was looking for new \nemployment, her daughter was getting older, and she had made some other life-style \nchanges. (Tr. 38) She has not received any medical treatment for abuse of illegal drugs. \n(Tr. 39; AE I) Her primary-care physician indicates she has not been prescribed any \ncontrolled substances; she has not received any inpatient mental-health treatment; and \nshe has been of \u201csound mental health.\u201d (Tr. 39; AE H) \nApplicant regrets her marijuana use, and she does not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future. (Tr. 40; AE I) She acknowledged her marijuana use was wrong, and she \napologized for her marijuana use. (Tr. 42) She provided a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for or would result in revocation of national security \neligibility. (AE I) See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), infra. She offered to voluntarily submit to random \nurinalysis testing for detection of abuse of illegal drugs. (Tr. 40-41) On April 24, 2023, she \ntested negative in a urinalysis-drug test for the presence of illegal drugs in her body.

(Tr. 27; AE I) A director where Applicant is currently employed \ndescribed her as an exceptional leader who is extremely talented, loyal, ethical, diligent, \nand trustworthy. (Tr. 41; AE J) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(f) is not \nestablished because she did not actually have access to classified information, and there \nis insufficient evidence that she held a \u201csensitive position.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c). Additional discussion is in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)); AE L. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana 10 or less times while working for a DOD \ncontractor. Her decision to repeatedly possess and use marijuana after being granted a \nsecurity clearance is an indication that she may lack the qualities expected of those with \naccess to national secrets. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. She voluntarily disclosed \nher marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. She disclosed \nher marijuana use on her SCA, to an OPM investigator, in her SOR response, and during \nher hearing. She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and she acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she ended her marijuana use in July 2021, and she \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future. Her husband continues to use marijuana \nalthough he does not use marijuana in her presence or in her home. I am not convinced \nher marijuana possession and use \u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur [and] does not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good \njudgment.\u201d I am uncertain about her future marijuana use. More time without marijuana \nuse is necessary to establish her future abstinence from marijuana possession and use. \nGuideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior manager. She has been employed since 2001 \nworking for two DOD contractors. She received four promotions from her first DOD \nemployer. In 2001, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems. \nShe was awarded master\u2019s degrees in business administration and information \nmanagement. Her resume provides additional information about her employment history \nand background. \nApplicant received excellent performance evaluations, which included \u201cexceeded \nexpectations\u201d in the areas of integrity and trust. Her ratings were all \u201cexceeded,\u201d \n\u201cimpactful,\u201d or \u201cexceptional.\u201d (AE B-AE F) Her employers since 2001 have never \ndisciplined her. A director where Applicant is currently employed described her as an \nexceptional leader who is extremely talented, loyal, ethical, diligent, and trustworthy. \nApplicant discussed his history of involvement with marijuana on her SCA, during \nher OPM personal subject interview, in her SOR response, and at her hearing. She did \nnot test positive on a urinalysis test, and she does not have any drug-related arrests. She \npromised not to use marijuana in the future. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant said she used marijuana 10 or less times after receiving a security clearance in \n2012; however, she did not actually have access to classified information. Her most \nrecent marijuana use was in July 2021, which was 22 months before her security \nclearance hearing in May 2023. She resides with her husband, who is a current marijuana \nuser. There is no \u201cbright line\u201d test on how long a person must abstain from marijuana \npossession and use to receive access to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nAn honest and candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to \nnational security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her \nown career or personal reputation. Applicant receives full credit for her candid and honest \nself-report of her marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith continued abstention from illegal drug possession and use, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was born in Kuwait but was granted Jordanian \ncitizenship at birth as both of his parents are citizens of Jordan. The record does not \nreflect when his family moved back to Jordan.

He also provided some financial support to them when needed. None \nof his family members is affiliated with a foreign government or foreign military. (GX 2-3) \nApplicant also disclosed that he travelled to Jordan three times in 2013 and twice \nin 2018. He visited his family on each of his trips. There is no record evidence of any \nmore recent travel to Jordan. (GX 2) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Jordan. They are in \ntheir late 70s and retired.

(AX A; FORM Response) \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) \nJordan is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Abdullah II bin Hussein. The \nking has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The multiparty parliament consists \nof a popularly elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by the king. \nThe Public Security Directorate has responsibility for law enforcement and reports to the \nMinistry of Interior. The Public Security Directorate and the General Intelligence \nDirectorate share responsibility for maintaining internal security. The General \nIntelligence Directorate reports directly to the king. The armed forces have a support \nrole for internal security. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over the security \nforces. There were credible reports that members of the security forces committed \nsome abuses. \nThe State Department updated its Country Report on Terrorism for Jordan in \nFebruary 2023. The information is substantially similar to the prior report, included as \npart of AN I. I refer to the more recent report available as it reflects the most current \ninformation available. Jordan remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and \ncountering violent extremism. As a regional leader in the Defeat-ISIS Global Coalition, \nJordan played an important role in coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group\u2019s \nterritorial control and operational reach. Although Jordan did not experience a \nsuccessful terrorist attack in 2021, the country faced a continued threat from terrorist \ngroups.

The capital of \nAmman is currently assessed as being a high-threat location for terrorism directed at or \naffecting official U.S. Government interests. Transnational and indigenous terrorist \ngroups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. \nViolent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-\nSham (ISIS), and al-Qaida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in \nJordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. Western interests and \n\u201csoft\u201d targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nschools and malls. Jordan's prominent role in the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS and its \nshared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. \nThe most recent State Department Human Rights Report for Jordan was issued \nin March 2023. Significant human rights issues in Jordan included credible reports of: \ntorture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment by \ngovernment authorities; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners or detainees; \narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and media, including harassment and intimidation of journalists, unjustified \narrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and enforcement of and threat to \nenforce criminal libel laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial \ninterference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, \nincluding overly restrictive laws on the organization, funding, or operation of \nnongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; inability of citizens to \nelect their executive branch of government or upper house of parliament; lack of \ninvestigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including but not limited to \ndomestic or intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and other harmful practices; \nviolence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or \nintersex persons; and significant restrictions on workers\u2019 freedom of association, \nincluding threats against labor activists. The government took some steps to investigate, \nprosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses; however, \ngovernment impunity for such abuses remained widespread. (See U.S. State \nDepartment, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022: Jordan: \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/jordan/ \n(March 20, 2023)) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DOD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, \nto a determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \nsecurity [and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance [or trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. It denotes a risk \ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \ngovernment or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with one or more family members living \nin Jordan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). There is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, their immediate family members. See ISCR 01\u00ad\n03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \nApplicant\u2019s parents, one brother and two sisters are citizens and residents of \nJordan. The country\u2019s shared borders with Iraq and Syria and the presence of ISIS and \nal-Qaida reflects that Jordan remains a high-threat location for terrorism and establish a \n\u201cheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a) has been raised by the evidence. \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nUnderstandably, Applicant maintains regular and frequent contact with his \nparents and siblings who reside in Jordan (as well as his Jordanian brother in Saudi \nArabia). It cannot be said that his relationship with his immediate family members are \ncasual or infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to them. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2007. He obtained an advanced \neducation and has established his career in the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen \nand both of his children are native-born U.S. citizens. He also has one brother and \nsister that are citizens and residents of the United States. These are all factors that \nweigh in Applicant's favor. \nHowever, his ties to Jordan are also strong. He maintains a very close \nrelationship with his parents and siblings in Jordan, communicating with them daily. He \nalso provides financial support to them when needed. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the Unites States. Additionally, Applicant did not meet \nhis burden of demonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a position \nof public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \nApplicant did not request a hearing and I did not have the opportunity to question \nhim further about his family connections to Jordan or to assess his credibility by \nobserving his demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nThe record reflects that Applicant came to the United States in 2007, became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2012, and has since worked and furthered his education. He has additionally \nmarried and raised two children in the United States. \nHowever, Applicant also maintains close and ongoing ties with his family in \nJordan. Although Jordan is a key U.S. ally in combating terrorism and extremist \nideology, it remains a high-threat location for terrorism. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \npublic trust position. Given Applicant\u2019s family connections to Jordan, I conclude that he \ndid not present sufficient evidence to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation. \nThis is not a comment as to Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States. It is merely a finding \nthat he did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in a technical program and earned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of expertise, he worked a variety of jobs including as a baggage handler, a car service agent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his bills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for his sick father. In 2020, Applicant started working with his current employer in a technical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6) Applicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he voluntarily disclosed his delinquent debts in detail during his January 2021 background interview.

Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 11, 2022, and provided additional \ndocuments. He elected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge from \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), in lieu of a hearing. On October \n27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant received the \nFORM on November 17, 2022. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did \nnot respond to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2023. The SOR and the Answer \n(Items 1, 2) are the pleadings in the case. The documents provided in the Answer as \nwell as Items 3 through 6 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k with explanation. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in a technical program \nand earned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of \nexpertise, he worked a variety of jobs including as a baggage handler, a car service \nagent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his \nbills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for \nhis sick father. In 2020, Applicant started working with his current employer in a \ntechnical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he \nvoluntarily disclosed his delinquent debts in detail during his January 2021 background \ninterview. (Items 3, 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,238), 1.b ($5,741), 1.c ($4,989), 1.d ($3,997), 1.e ($3,950), 1.f \n($3,487), 1.h ($951) and 1.i ($877) are all past-due federal student loans with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (DOE) that Applicant opened in 2013 and 2014. The debts \ntotal about $33,000. During his interview, Applicant stated he had not made any \npayments on the loans since 2015 or taken any subsequent steps to repay the debt. \nHowever, he intended on setting up a payment plan as soon as possible. (Items 4-6) \nIn his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant stated he was \nin the process of making payment arrangements on the student loans. He submitted a \ncopy of a March 2022 DOE Loan Rehabilitation application. There is no evidence that \nthe application was approved or that he submitted any payments in compliance with it. \nAn April 2022 credit report reflects that the loans are in collection status with the DOE \nas the creditor.

He stated \nhe was scheduling a payment plan and included a copy of his March 2022 Loan \nRehabilitation application. He did not include any evidence of payments. (Item 2) \nAs of this writing, the repayment of several federal student loans are in \nforbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential \nExecutive Orders since March 2020. Federal student loan payments remain paused \nuntil at least June 30, 2023. See (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-\n19). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,453) is a charged-off credit card account. During his interview, \nApplicant disclosed that this account became late in 2019 and that he intended to \nsatisfy it. In his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, he stated that \u201cfull \npayments have been made\u201d and that a payment confirmation was attached. In support, \nhe produced two documents confirming the settlement of a debt not alleged in the SOR. \nIn his Answer, Applicant included one of these documents and again claimed the debt \nhad been paid. However, neither the account name, number or other identifiable \ninformation from the document can be associated with this SOR debt. The debt is \nreflected as charged off in Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($86) is a medical debt that was placed for collection. Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated he would resolve it as soon as possible. However, there is \nno evidence of a payment or other resolution of this debt in the record. (Items 2, 4-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($44,756) is a joint mortgage account that is past due with a total loan \nbalance of $378,803. Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report reflects that the mortgage was \nopened in May 2017 with a date of last activity of May 2020. Applicant admitted the debt \nand stated he was a \u201cco-signer to the house.\u201d He did not elaborate on when or why the \nloan became past due. He did not present any plan to bring the mortgage current or \nstate whether he intended on refinancing or selling the house. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant\u2019s March 2022 paystub showed that he earned, with overtime, take-\nhome pay of $2,999 every two weeks. He did not specify how often he earned overtime. \nA Personal Financial Statement shows he maintained a net monthly remainder of about \n$700. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe debts in the SOR, including multiple delinquent federal student loans, a past-\ndue mortgage account, and other delinquent debts, are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the credit report in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant acknowledged in his background interview that he had not made any \npayments towards his student loans since 2015. The loans remained delinquent for \nyears prior to DOE\u2019s COVID moratorium on payments and Applicant\u2019s March 2022 Loan \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nRehabilitation application. A credit report continues to show the loans in collection \nstatus. Additionally, his mortgage account, charged-off credit card and a medical \naccount in collection remain delinquent and unresolved. His delinquencies are therefore \nongoing. He has not established that his debts are due to circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant experienced some financial stress in 2019 when he earned insufficient \nincome to cover his bills and took time off work to care for his sick father. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore has some application. However, Applicant has not shown he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His only attempt to resolve his student loans \noccurred in March 2022; long after the loans became delinquent and did not include any \nsubsequent payments or payment plan. He provided no explanation for why his \nmortgage account remained significantly past due or a plan for resolving this debt. He \nfailed to provide evidence that the charged-off credit card and medical account in \ncollection are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant did not provide documentary or other corroborating evidence to show \nthat he issued payments or made other good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentary or \nother evidence to establish that the financial security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM. In so \ndoing, he did not provide any additional evidence in explanation or mitigation beyond his \nAnswer. Following the completion of his associate\u2019s degree in 2015, Applicant did not \ntake any action in resolving his delinquent student loans until he submitted his DOE \nLoan Rehabilitation application in March 2022. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s student loans, mortgage and additional accounts remain \ndelinquent, and he has not established any payments or shown other efforts towards \nresolving them. He has not established a reliable financial track record and has not met \nhis burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The SOR and the Answer \n(Items 1, 2) are the pleadings in the case. The documents provided in the Answer as \nwell as Items 3 through 6 were admitted without objection. \nOn March 16, 2023, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed. On May 16, 2023, the Appeal Board remanded \nthe decision. Several of the debts in this case concern Applicant\u2019s federal student loans \nthat arose from his attendance at ITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech). In its decision, the \nAppeal Board took administrative notice of a press release from the Department of \nEducation (DoE) dated August 16, 2022, concerning the discharge of ITT Tech student \nloan debt, and noted that they had done so in previous cases. (Appeal Board Decision \nat 2, citing ISCR Case N. 21-01688 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2023)) In remanding the case, \nthe Appeal Board directed that I \u201cdetermine the impact of DoE\u2019s action on Applicant\u2019s \nstudent loans\u201d and issue a new decision. (Appeal Board Decision at 2) \nOn May 23, 2023, as permitted by the Appeal Board, I reopened the record and \nallowed both parties to submit any additional exhibits or information. Applicant \nsubsequently submitted five emails with statements and attachments that I have \nidentified as AX A through E. The Government submitted additional argument but no \nadditional documents and did not object to Applicant\u2019s exhibits. \nI also notified the parties that I would take administrative notice (AN) of the DoE\u2019s \nAugust 2022 press release, as cited in the Appeal Board\u2019s decision. (AN I) The record \nclosed on June 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in ITT Tech and \nearned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of \nexpertise, he worked a variety of jobs, including as a baggage handler, a car service \nagent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his \nbills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for \nhis sick father. In 2020, Applicant started working with his current employer in a \ntechnical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he \nvoluntarily disclosed several delinquent debts in detail during his January 2021 \nbackground interview.

The debts totaled \nabout $33,000. During his interview, Applicant stated he had not made any payments \non the loans since graduating in 2015 and he had not taken any subsequent steps to \nrepay the debt. However, he intended on setting up a payment plan as soon as \npossible. (Items 4-6) \nIn his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant included a \nDoE Loan Rehabilitation application, dated that same month, and stated he was in the \nprocess of making payment arrangements on the student loans. There is no evidence \nthat he submitted any payments under this plan. The most recent credit report in the \nrecord, from April 2022, reflects that the loans were in collection status with DoE as the \ncreditor. (Items 4, 5) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the delinquent student loans and stated \nthat a payment plan with DoE was pending. He did not include any evidence of \npayments. (Item 2) \nHowever, in August 2022, DoE issued a press release stating it was discharging \nall student loans relating to ITT Tech that originated from 2005 through 2016. In the \npress release, DoE recited the troubled history of ITT Tech, specifically noting that \nITT Tech had misled students about the quality of their programs for years in order to \nprofit from the federal student loan programs. This announcement followed a series of \nlawsuits, settlements and other remedial actions taken by DoE against ITT Tech. In \nJanuary 2023, Applicant received notice from DoE that his student loans were \ndischarged as part of these efforts. (AN I; AX A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,453) is a charged-off credit card account. During his interview, \nApplicant disclosed that this account became delinquent in 2019 and that he intended to \nsatisfy it. In his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, he stated that the \naccount had been paid and that a payment confirmation was attached. In support, he \nproduced two documents confirming the settlement of another credit card account in \ncollection that was not alleged in the SOR. In his Answer and in his subsequent \nsubmission, he included a copy of one of these documents and again claimed the debt \nhad been paid. However, neither the account name, number or other identifiable \ninformation from the document can be associated with this SOR debt. The debt is \nreflected as charged off in Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($86) is a medical debt that was placed for collection. Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated he would resolve it as soon as possible. Following the \nreopening of the record, he provided a document showing that, in March 2023, the \naccount was paid in full. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($44,756) is a joint mortgage account that was past due with a total \nloan balance of $378,803.

He did not \nelaborate on when or why the loan became past due or detail any plan to bring the \nmortgage current. (Items 2, 4-6) \nFollowing the reopening of the record, Applicant detailed that he had co-signed \nfor the mortgage, but did not own the home. He stated he was not aware that the loan \nwas delinquent until he received the SOR. He then claimed that the owner had, without \nhis knowledge, modified the mortgage and borrowed additional funds. Applicant stated \nhe was pursing court proceedings to force a sale of the property in order to be removed \nfrom the loan. (AX B) \nHowever, Applicant later produced correspondence from an attorney clarifying \nthat the mortgage had not been modified. Instead, the attorney speculated that the \nowner had likely added arrears to the loan balance and that there remained \napproximately $150,000 in equity should the house be sold. (AX C) \nApplicant did not provide any additional information regarding his efforts to be \nremoved from the loan. Instead, he produced a transaction history from the mortgage \nservicer, dated March 2023, that reflected the mortgage had been in various levels of \ndelinquency from early 2020 through the middle of 2022. However, a payment of about \n$45,000 was posted to the account in October 2022. This, and subsequent smaller \npayments, brought the mortgage current. (AX D) \nApplicant submitted a paystub and budget that showed he was maintaining full \ntime employment with a net monthly remainder of about $700. Applicant\u2019s employer \ndescribed him as maintaining a strong work ethic and receiving exemplary praise from \nthe various clients he served. (GX 5; AX E) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe history of delinquent debts reflected in the SOR, including multiple federal \nstudent loans, a past-due mortgage account, and other accounts in collection, are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the April 2022 credit report in the record. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a \ndebt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. \n21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of \nevery debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the \nfinancial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThere are four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant acquired sizeable student loans while studying at ITT Tech from 2013 \nthrough 2015. Although he did not discuss his experiences at that school, he struggled \nto obtain employment after earning a degree there. His income remained inconsistent \nthrough 2019 when he voluntarily took leave from work while caring for his father. He \nfinally began earning a consistent income in 2020 when he started with his current \nemployer. \nApplicant stated his intent to address his student loans during his background \ninvestigation and eventually submitted a DoE Loan Rehabilitation application in March \n2022. Before a payment plan was established, DoE fully discharged his loans. This \ncame after DoE determined that ITT Tech had, for years, misled students about the \nquality of their programs and engaged in predatory lending practices. \nAdditionally, in 2017, despite his own financial struggles, Applicant co-signed for \na mortgage but did not track the status of the account. On receipt of the SOR, he \nlearned that the mortgage was substantially delinquent. A month later, the first of \nseveral payments was issued to resolve the arrears. The account remains current. \nApplicant also resolved additional accounts not alleged in the SOR and recently \npaid his delinquent medical debt. While Applicant did not provide documentation to \nshow specific payment of the SOR 1.g debt, his overall efforts at debt reduction reflect \nthat he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAlthough Applicant could have documented his efforts to satisfy these debts \nearlier, he has established that he has no current financial problems. Moreover, the \nresolution of these accounts and his current financial situation reflect that his financial \nproblems were a temporary aberration. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the student \nloans because of the details provided within the DoE press release and evidence \nshowing that his student loans were discharged.

AG \u00b6 20(a) also applies because his debts occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant graduated from, the now discredited, ITT Tech in 2015. He struggled to \nfind employment in his field of expertise and maintain consistent income. In 2019, he \nalso spent a period away from work caring for his father. These events led to his \nfinancial delinquencies. \nApplicant secured his current employment in 2020. Shortly afterwards, he \nresolved some delinquent accounts. In 2022, he applied for rehabilitation of his student \nloans. Before he made any payments, DoE discharged the loans. Additionally, when he \nlearned that the mortgage account that he cosigned for was delinquent, he brought the \naccount current and provided documentation showing that payments are now being \nmade timely. He also provided a budget establishing his ability to maintain his accounts \ngoing forward. \nWith the additional information provided by Applicant, he has shown that his \nfinancial concerns are an anomaly.

She previously worked for the same federal \ncontractor from November 2019 until June 2021. She married in 2003 and divorced in \n2013. This is her first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nThe SOR alleges four debts totaling $63,562. The debts are comprised of a \npersonal loan and two credit cards owed to the same creditor and a $143 debt owed to a \ncable company. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the three debts owed to the \nsame creditor and denies the debt owed to the cable company stating that she has paid \nit. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s March 2022 credit-bureau report \n(CBR). (GX 5.) She also discussed her delinquent debts during her April 2022 personal \nsubject interview (PSI). (GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nFrom March 2007 until March 2012, Applicant was employed by a federal \ncontractor overseas. When she returned to the United States in 2012, her income \ndecreased significantly. Following her divorce in 2013, Applicant\u2019s minor children lived \nwith her and she was primarily responsible for all of their care. This created even greater \nfinancial strain. Applicant stated in her PSI that during the period between 2012 and 2019 \nshe struggled financially due to her decreased income, her increased financial \nresponsibilities, including medical bills for one of her children, who suffered from an \nillness. (GX 4.) \nIn 2011, while employed overseas, Applicant opened a personal credit-card \naccount. She routinely used this card and made on-time payments. After returning to the \nUnited States, Applicant began using her credit card for necessary living expenses. In \n2013, Applicant opened a second personal credit-card account with the same creditor \nthat she used in an effort to maintain her financial obligations in the wake of her divorce. \nIn 2014, Applicant obtained a personal loan through the same creditor. Because she \nrequired a vehicle to maintain employment and care for her children, she used the \nproceeds of this loan to pay off her vehicle loan as well as to maintain her other financial \nobligations. (GX 4; GX 5; GX 6; Answer.) \nBetween March 2012 and December 2017, Applicant was employed in low-paying \npositions outside of her professional field of expertise. By March 2016, she was no longer \nable to maintain the payments on her two credit-card accounts and on her personal loan. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant contacted the creditor and explained her circumstances, but was not in position \nto resolve the accounts, and defaulted on each of the accounts. These are the delinquent \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. These accounts have been charged off. (GX \n3; GX 4; GX 5; GX 6.) \nDespite her efforts to find employment, the job market was difficult in the area \nwhere Applicant and her children resided. Applicant was unemployed from December \n2017 until August 2018. From August 2018 until November 2019, Applicant was \nemployed part time in a low-paying job. In November 2019, she gained employment with \na federal contractor in an overseas position in her field of expertise. She discontinued her \ncable service, paid her final bill, and returned the equipment to the company. The creditor \nof the $134 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is this cable company. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and disputed the debt as indicated on GX 5. In her answer to the SOR in her \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant again stated that she had contacted this creditor. The \ndebt does not appear on her December 2022 CBR. This account has been resolved. \nBetween November 2019 and mid-2021, Applicant submitted an e-QIP several \ntimes. However, her federal-contractor employer terminated her in June 2021 without \nexplanation. After her termination, Applicant contacted the DOD Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) for information regarding the status of her security clearance \nprocessing. The DOD CAF contacted her employer, who stated that the reason for \nApplicant\u2019s termination was that there was an internal administrative issue that resulted \nin her e-QIP not being properly completed or submitted, that resulted in the \ndiscontinuation of their sponsorship. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nFollowing her termination, Applicant returned to the United States. She was \nunemployed from June 2021 until January 2022 when she regained employment with her \nprior federal contractor employer. She has returned to her overseas position. However, \nshe is experiencing the same difficulties as she previously experienced as she awaits \nresolution of her security clearance status. In an effort to maintain her employment, she \nhas been using her vacation leave, approved administrative leave, and has taken a leave \nof absence. (GX 3; Response.) \nDespite the financial difficulties that Applicant experienced between 2012 and \n2019, she has not had any additional delinquent accounts since 2013. Her children are \nnow adults and she is no longer financially responsible for them. Applicant understands \nthat she is responsible for repaying these accounts and considers resolving them a \npriority.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues initially arose in 2012 when she returned to the United \nStates from overseas employment and experienced a significant decrease in income. \nBetween 2012 and 2019 Applicant was either underemployed or unemployed. She and \nher husband divorced in 2013 and Applicant had primary financial and custodial \nresponsibility for her two minor children, one of whom suffered from an illness. In an effort \nto make ends meet, Applicant used her two credit cards and the proceeds from her \npersonal loan in an effort to maintain her financial obligations for herself and for her \nchildren. She prioritized using a portion of the personal loan proceeds to pay off her \nvehicle loan. Ultimately, in 2016, she was no longer able to maintain the payments on her \ntwo credit cards and personal loan and she defaulted on them. These are the delinquent \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a. through 1.c. \nHowever, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Between 2012 \nand 2019, she secured whatever employment was available to her. Despite her sustained \nperiod of underemployment or /unemployment, she did not incur any delinquent debt or \ndefault on any accounts after 2013. She contacted the creditor of SOR debts 1.a. through \n1.c and advised them of her financial situation prior to defaulting on the accounts. In 2019 \nshe accepted a lucrative position in her field of expertise working overseas for a federal \ncontractor. Since she was terminated from his position due to administrative error on the \nemployer\u2019s part, she has been rehired and is again working overseas in a lucrative \nposition. She remains committed to resolve these debts as soon as she is financially able. \nShe successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, a small remainder from an old \ncable bill, and it no longer appears on her most recent credit-bureau report. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) While those granted access to classified information are \nheld to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant\u2019s financial habits are \nreckless or irresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the \nfuture. She accepts responsibility for her three remaining delinquent accounts and fully \nwill resolve them. She lives within her means and has not incurred any recent delinquent \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal-contractor employer\u2019s willingness to rehire Applicant indicates \nthat she previously conducted herself in a manner consistent with an individual warranting \na security clearance. Despite the significant financial challenges that she experienced \nbetween 2012 and 2019, including divorce, underemployment and unemployment, and \nthe illness of her child, Applicant did not incur any additional delinquent debt in the last \n10 years. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by her financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
