He failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption,\nand Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On December 14, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nJ (Criminal Conduct), promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs\nissued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy\nof the Directive and the applicable Adjudicative Guidelines.  On January 8, 2007, Applicant filed a\nsigned response to the SOR.  He requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.\nThe Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 14, 2007.  The FORM\ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  \nAn undated copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any\nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant forwarded five\nenclosures, which were, in turn, provided to Department Counsel for review on April 2, 2007.  The\nenclosures were identified as Applicant\u2019s enclosures 1 through 5.  Department Counsel did not object\nto the admission of Applicant\u2019s enclosures.  On April 12, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a\ndecision.  After a careful review of Applicant\u2019s five enclosures, I marked them as exhibits (Ex.) A, B,\nC, D, and E and admitted them to the record of this case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant\nconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1993 to at\nleast April 2006 (\u00b6 1.a.); that he was charged with (1) Minor in Possession of Alcohol and (2) False\nInformation to a Police Officer in about February 1999, pled guilty, was fined about $450, his license\nprivilege was suspended for about one year, and he was placed on probation to August 1999 (\u00b6 1.b.);\nthat Applicant was arrested in about February 2002 and charged with (1) Disorderly Conduct and (2)\nDrunk in Public (\u00b6 1.c.); and that in October 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol and (2) Blood Alcohol Level .08% or Higher and that he pled\nNo Contest, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, fined\n\n3\napproximately $1,850, placed on unsupervised probation for three years, and ordered to attend six\nmonths of a Driving Under the Influence Program (DUIP) and one Mothers Against Drunk\nDriving(MADD) meeting (\u00b6 1.d.).\nIn the SOR, DOHA also alleged that the conduct alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. under\nGuideline G also constituted Criminal Conduct under Guideline J (\u00b6 2.a.); that Applicant was arrested\nin June 2001 and charged with (1) Concealed Gun in Car and (2) Public Nuisance, pled guilty to the\ntwo charges, was fined about $450, and sentenced to probation and a public work service program (\u00b6\n2.b.); and, in December 2005, was charged with Driving When Privilege Suspended or Revoked, was\nfound guilty, and was fined $375 (\u00b6 2.c.)\nApplicant admitted all Guideline G and Guideline J allegations.  He provided mitigating\ninformation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 28 years old, unmarried,  and employed as an Electronic Technician 1 by a defense\ncontractor.  He holds an Associate in Science degree in computer and electronics engineering\ntechnology.  Applicant submitted and certified an electronic security clearance questionnaire on\nSeptember 2, 2005.  (Item 4.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he had not consumed alcohol to excess since\nOctober 2005. He further stated he did not recall drinking alcohol in 1993.  He provided no evidence\nin support of his assertions.  (Item 3 at 1.)  He informed his employer of his October 2005 DUI and\nhis conviction in December 2005 of Driving When Privilege Suspended or Revoked.  Pursuant to\ninstructions in the National Industrial Security Manual (NISPOM), Applicant\u2019s employer filed adverse\ninformation reports.  (Item 5, Item 6; Ex. A, Ex. D.)  \nApplicant submitted a copy of his first offender six-month appointment schedule for\nparticipation in a DUIP program.  (Ex. B.)  He also submitted a certificate of completion, dated\nFebruary 10, 2006, showing he had completed four days of public service work on December 16, 2005,\nas directed by the Court in sentencing him for his November 2005 DUI conviction.  (Ex. C.)  He also\nsubmitted a notice of completion certificate showing he had enrolled in a DUIP program on November\n29, 2005 and had completed the program on July 10, 2006.  (Ex. E.)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 2, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\n\n4\nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified. The\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive\n5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations\nin which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case\nwas issued December 11, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions  and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\nApplicant is 28 years old, and his admitted consumption of alcohol to excess and at times to\nintoxication spans a period of approximately 13 to 14 years.  Excessive alcohol consumption raises\nsecurity concerns because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to\ncontrol impulses, thus raising questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline G 21. \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions show he was arrested three times between\n1999 and 2005 and charged with alcohol-related offenses.  After his arrest and No Contest plea for\nDUI in October 2005, he was directed by the court to enroll in a six-month DUIP program.  He\nprovided evidence he had completed the program, and he claimed he had not consumed alcohol to\nexcess since October 2005. However, he provided no credible evidence to corroborate his claim of\ntemperate consumption of alcohol. \n\nDC 22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, child\n3\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  DC 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \n5\nThe alcohol-related conduct alleged in the SOR and admitted by Applicant raises concerns\nunder Disqualifying Condition (DC) 22(a) and (DC) 22(c).   His three alcohol arrests away from work\n3\nraise concerns under DC 22(a).  His admitted habitual consumption of alcohol to excess and\nsometimes to the point of intoxication for approximately 13 to 14  years raises concerns under DC 22\n(c). \nUnder Guideline G, there are four conditions that could apply to Applicant\u2019s disqualifying\nconduct.  An applicant might mitigate disqualifying conduct under Mitigating Condition (MC)  23(a)\nof Guideline G if he provided credible evidence to show that so much time has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  An applicant\nmight also mitigate disqualifying conduct under MC 23(b) by acknowledging his or her alcoholism\nor issues of alcohol abuse, provid[ing] evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and. . .\nestablish[ing] a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nIf an applicant is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress, he\nmight be able to provide evidence of mitigation under MC 23 (c).  Finally, MC 23(d) might apply if\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in\nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of\na recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted excessive use of alcohol covers a period of 13 to 14 years.  The record\nreflects three alcohol-related arrests: in 1999, 2002, and 2005.  Thus, his disqualifying behavior was\nnot infrequent, and his most recent arrest occurred less than two years ago.  Applicant failed to provide\ncredible evidence that the conduct was not habitual, unlikely to recur, and did not lead to concerns\nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  While he provided evidence he had\ncompleted a six-month DUIP program, as ordered by the court, he failed to acknowledge his issues\nof alcohol abuse or to provide credible evidence of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser).  Accordingly, I conclude that MC 23(a) and MC 23(b) are inapplicable.\nApplicant provided no credible evidence he was participating, as an employee, in a\ncounseling or treatment program and making satisfactory progress.  He failed to provide evidence to\nshow he had no previous treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse and no history of relapse.  While\nhe provided evidence he had successfully completed a six-month DUIP program, he failed to provide\nevidence of a demonstrated pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accord with treatment\nrecommendations.  Additionally, he failed to show participation in a recommended program of\naftercare or to provide evidence of a favorable prognosis.  Accordingly, I conclude MC 23(c) and MC\n23(d) are inapplicable. \n\nDC 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  DC 31(d) reads: \u201cindividual is currently\n4\non parole or probation.\u201d \n6\nCriminal Conduct\nThe record in this case shows that Applicant was arrested in 1999, 2002,and 2005 for alcohol-\nrelated criminal conduct. In 2001, he was arrested, charged, and pled guilty to (1) Concealed Gun in\nCar and (2) Public Nuisance.  In October 2005, as a result of his arrest and no contest plea to a charge\nof DUI, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail (suspended), placed\non three years of unsupervised probation, fined, and ordered to attend a six-month DUIP program.  In\nDecember 2005, he was charged, found guilty, and fined  for Driving When Privilege Suspended or\nRevoked.\nCriminal conduct creates a security concern because it raises doubts about an individual\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Additionally, it raises doubts about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal activity raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 31(a) and 31(d)  of Guideline J.\n4\nOnly one mitigating condition under Guideline J might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if\nhe provided credible evidence to show that so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Applicant\u2019s criminal\nactivity is recent.  After the court suspended his driver\u2019s license as a part of his sentence for DUI in\nOctober 2005, and placed him on three years of unsupervised probation, Applicant then drove on a\nsuspended license, raising serious doubts not only about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment but also about his ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant failed to provide\ncredible evidence under MC 32(a) to mitigate the criminal conduct alleged in the SOR.  No other MCs\napply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an\nadministrative judge must thoroughly consider and review of all available reliable information about\nthe appellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.  DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole\nperson concept.\u201d  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish he began consuming alcohol to\nexcess as a minor.  He continued his excessive consumption of alcohol until at least 2005.  He received\nand completed alcohol counseling.  After the counseling, he returned to the use of alcohol and\nprovided no credible evidence that his use of alcohol is now responsible or recommended by the health\n\n7\nprofessionals who treated him in the DUIP program.  He provided no credible evidence to support a\nconclusion that he is reliable, trustworthy, and merits a security clearance.\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as a\nwhole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has neither\nrebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and he has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline G.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.: Guideline J.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On March 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 17, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  I received the case assignment on July 9,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on July 23, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\n\n2\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing on July 30, 2008.  The record closed on August 8, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 46 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements during the clearance screening\nprocess.  The Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR.\nThe Applicant was a member of the United States Armed Forces for eight years,\nuntil 1992.  In 1992 he was tried by a General Court-Martial for various drug offenses.\nThe specifications included one count of Use of Methamphetamine, one count of the\nUse of Hashish, and two counts of the Use of Marijuana, all under Article 112a of the\nUniform Code of Military Justice.  The Applicant plead guilty to all four charges, and\nreceived a sentence that included prison time and a Bad Conduct Discharge.  The\nApplicant\u2019s wife was also implicated in his misconduct.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nWith regards to his court-martial, the Applicant has consistently maintained that\nhe did not use methamphetamine and hashish as alleged.  Rather, he states that he\nreceived poor legal advice, and that in the military being in the presence of illegal\nsubstances is the same as using it.  He furthermore states that a military investigation\nreport, which has other service members implicating him in the use of\nmethamphetamine and hashish, is not correct.  He testified, \u201cI still stand by what I said.\nNo, I did not use it and have not used it.  However, I am guilty by association.  So, you\nknow, that makes me guilty.  I have no problems with being guilty by that association,\nbut I am not guilty by use.\u201d  (Transcript at 39-40.)\nIn 1999, the Applicant and his wife were charged with Possession of Marijuana\nand/or Disturbing the Peace.  According to the Applicant\u2019s account, he and his wife\nwere walking on a beach when they spotted a bag which had marijuana inside it.  His\nwife picked up the bag and they continued to walk.  A policeman approached, asked\nthem if they picked up anything, they admitted having the bag, and they were cited.  At\ncourt, the Applicant plead guilty to Disturbing the Peace, and was sentenced to a fine\nand one year\u2019s probation.  The actual citation was not entered into evidence, nor is\nthere any other evidence stating what offense the Applicant was charged with.\n(Government Exhibit 3; Transcript at 32-36.)\n\n3\nThe Applicant signed an eQIP (Government Exhibit 1) on December 2, 2005.  He\ntestified that he failed to proof read this copy of the questionnaire before signing it.  He\nfurther stated that the failure is solely his responsibility, and not his company\u2019s.\n(Transcript at 30-32, 35-38.)\nThat questionnaire asks the following as question 19, \u201cHave you ever received\nother than an honorable discharge from the military?\u201d  The Applicant answered, \u201cYes,\u201d\nand admitted he had received a Bad Conduct Discharge in 1993 (actually 1992).  He did\nnot set forth the charges for which he was court-martialed.  \n1.a.  The questionnaire asks the following as question 23.d., \u201cHave you ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and related a 2002 Driving Under the Influence arrest.  He\ndid not discuss his 1992 Court-Martial or the 1999 citation.  This answer was, therefore,\nincomplete.  \nThe Applicant testified at great length, and under cross-examination, about how\nhe completed the questionnaire concerning this question.  He stated that he had\nprepared a hand written record for his company and that in that record he had\ncompletely set forth the Court-Martial and the 1999 citation.  (Transcript at 30-31, 35-\n36.)  In addition, because he had previously admitted the Court-Martial on the same\nquestionnaire, there is some question of intent, which will be discussed below.\n1.b.  Question 24.b. of the questionnaire asks, \u201cHave you ever illegally used a\ncontrolled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or\ncourtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly\nand immediately affecting the public safety?\u201d (Emphasis in original.)  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cYes,\u201d and stated that he had used marijuana a couple of times from 1989 to\n1990.\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant actually used marijuana until 1993\nwhile holding a security clearance and, therefore, his statement was false.  The support\nfor this is an unsworn declaration of an interview of the Applicant taken on June 21,\n2006.  That declaration states, \u201cSubject [the Applicant] has not used marijuana in the\nlast ten years however, he admitted to using marijuana on seven or eight occasions\nprior to 1993.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 3 at 8.) \nThe Applicant testified concerning this point, \u201cI thought that showing my Court\nMartial would have been entered - - so, there was no reason for me to say it there.  It\nwas specifically under Air Force.  And I did check it that yes, I did use it while I had a\nSecurity Clearance before.\u201d  (Transcript at 38.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s answers are not inherently contradictory, or at odds with the\nfacts.  While the Applicant was actually discharged from the military in 1993, he had\nbeen in confinement or preparing for a court-martial since 1991.  He therefore did not\nhave a security clearance during that time.\n\n4\n1.c.  The Applicant made another unsworn declaration to a Department of\nDefense investigator on June 7, 2007.  The investigator reported:\nSubject answered the question of why he did not disclose his use of\nhashish and methamphetamine (possible cocaine) in the SI [subject\ninterview] dated 6/21/06.  Subject does not recall the answers in the\n6/21/06 paperwork but he would not disclose this because he has not\nused methamphetamine, cocaine or hashish.  Subject had been in the\npresence of others who were using, but the [Applicant] has not used those\ndrugs and the only drug he has used is marijuana.  The military code of\njustice considers being in the presence of and failing to report, the same\nas use of the drug.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 5.)\nThe Government alleges that this statement is false.  This is based on the\nApplicant\u2019s conviction after a guilty plea of the use of methamphetamine, his own\nstatement to military investigators, and the statements of other service members that he\ndid use the drugs.  Contradicting this is the Applicant\u2019s consistent, and adamant,\nstatements that he did not use methamphetamine.  He freely admits his use of\nmarijuana.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer; Transcript at 27-30, 39-40.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected employee.  His supervisor states, \u201c[The Applicant] has performed admirably\nsince he began employment . . . and continues to do so.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 16(a), the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\n\n6\nany personnel security questionnaire,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG &\n16(b), Adeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts\nto an . . . investigator@ may also raise security concerns. Based on the facts of this case,\nI find that these Disqualifying Conditions do not apply for the following reasons.  \nThe Applicant put the Government on notice in Government Exhibit 1 that he had\nbeen Court-Martialed and received a Bad Conduct Discharge as a result of that Court-\nMartial.  In addition, he put the Government on notice that he had been involved with\nillegal drugs during his time in the Air Force.  He plead guilty to using\nmethamphetamine, but has consistently denied its use since that time.  \nI have considered the Applicant\u2019s explanations for why his questionnaire does not\ncontain information on the 1999 marijuana incident and find them to be plausible.  In\nparticular, without documentary evidence, I cannot find to a reasonable degree of\ncertainty that the Applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana as opposed to\nDisturbing the Peace.\nFinally, the Applicant has consistently stated that he did not use\nmethamphetamine, but that the military puts use in the same category as being present\nwhere the drug is used.  The Applicant\u2019s understanding may, or may not, be legally\ncorrect.  What is important, however, is that he believes it to be the case.  Once again, I\ncannot find with a reasonable degree of certainty that he lied to a Department of\nDefense investigator in 2007.\nThe Applicant attempted to put the Government on notice about his years old\ndrug history.  In doing so, some of his answers were incomplete, and others were\nwrong.  Certainly, he could have done a better job proof reading his questionnaire.\nHowever, looked at in a manner most favorable to the Government, all of these acts, or\nfailures to act, merely show that the Applicant is human and can make mistakes, not\nthat he intended to falsify statements to the Government.  Since I find that the Applicant\ndid not intentionally falsify his questionnaire or statement to a Department of Defense\ninvestigator, none of the Mitigating Conditions are applicable.  Paragraph 1 is found for\nthe Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n7\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has overcome his earlier drug use.  In viewing all\nthe facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has mitigated any security significance of\nhis prior conduct.  As set forth at length above, I find that the Applicant did not intend to\ndeceive the Government (AG \u00b62(a)(1) and (2).  In addition, I find that there is little to no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alleged\npersonal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has 13 past due accounts totaling approximately $22,000 arising from \nhis 2003 divorce. Applicant has paid none of the debts. After a thorough review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude Applicant has failed to rebut or \nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 5, 2008, detailing security concerns \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts. \n  \n \nOn March 25, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On April 22, 2008, I was assigned the case. On May 7, \n2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on May 22, 2008. \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through R, which were \nadmitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nJuly 14, 2008, additional documents were received. Department Counsel did not object \nto the material and it was admitted into evidence as Ex. S. On June 5, 2008, the \ntranscript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted being incarcerated for 109 days \n(SOR \u00b6 1. m) and denied the remaining allegations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. The admission \nis incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of the record, case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior engineering technician (Tr. 87) who has worked \nfor a defense contractor since 1991, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers and supervisors state Applicant is serious-minded, dependable, \nreliable, effective, dedicated, security conscious, and a trusted courier of classified \ninformation who displays the highest level of integrity and pride. (Ex. J) \n \n \nApplicant was divorced in February 2003. (Tr. 130) In 2003, he was making \n$40,000 a year. (Tr. 71) The divorce decree set forth the responsibility for the joint \nobligations. Applicant indicated he would submit a copy of the decree following the \nhearing. (Tr. 97) No copy was received.  \n \nIn December 2003, ten months after the divorce decree, Applicant was cited for \ncivil contempt for failing to comply with six of the judge\u2019s orders related to his divorce. In \norder to avoid arrest, Applicant stopped going to work, and moved out of his home and \ninto a motel where he was arrested attempting to jump out the window. (Ex. 2) He had \nmarijuana in the room for which he received a $1,500 fine. (Tr. 106, Ex. 2) He was \nsentenced to 30 days in jail for each of six counts of civil contempt, for a total of 180 \ndays. On January 15, 2004, he started his jail sentence and served 109 days in jail. (Tr. \n102)  \n \n \nApplicant and his now ex-wife owned a home together. He was to buy out her \nequity in the home. (Tr. 130) He provided a check for $18,000 that was applied to joint \ndebts and was unable to obtain additional funds with which to buy out her equity. (Tr. \n130) All utility bills were to be paid from the sale of the home. (Tr. 59) Three of the SOR \n\n \n \n \n3\ndebts are utility bills related to the family home: SOR \u00b6 1. h ($248) was the cable TV \nbox, SOR \u00b6 1. k ($22) was for long distance telephone service, and SOR \u00b6 1. l ($165) \nwas another utility bill. (Tr. 59, 69, 88, Answer to SOR) Applicant surrendered the house \nto his ex-wife when he went to jail. (Tr. 74, 131) The house was later sold. Applicant \nnever received his $7,500 from the sale of the house. The funds were used to address \nobligations.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to pay his divorce attorney\u2019s fees ($4,870) and failed to pay his \nappellate attorney\u2019s fees ($3,765) owed since January 2004. A garnishment was started \nto recover payment on one of the debts. The garnishment stopped before the debt was \npaid. In his written interrogatories (Ex. 2), dated November 2007, Applicant said he \nplanned to pay this debt \u201cwithin the next 10 years.\u201d (Ex. 2, page 8) In May 2007, he \nstarted making $100 monthly payments on the appellate attorney\u2019s bill. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant sought credit counseling the Consumer\u2019s Credit Counseling \nService (CCCS). He did not attend a financial management class, but filled out \npaperwork. (Tr. 189) In discussing his financial situation with CCCS, he listed 17 debts \ntotaling approximately $58,000 and later added an additional $3,800 debt owed his \nAppellant attorney. Applicant made no payments under the CCCS plan, which would \nhave required monthly payments of $952. (Tr. 42, 134, Ex Q) CCCS suggested \nApplicant file for bankruptcy protection. (Tr. 38, 135) Applicant met with a bankruptcy \nattorney and learned most of his debt could not be discharged. (Tr. 42-43, 180) \n \n \nIn the CCCS list of debts, three debts (creditors 3, 4, and 5) totaling \napproximately $17,400 were for joint obligations. Applicant withdrew $18,000 from his \nretirement plan and provided his ex-wife\u2019s attorney with the $18,000 check. The check \nwas supposed to pay the debts listed to the three creditors, however, Applicant does not \nknow if any of the creditors were paid from the $18,000. (Tr. 94)  \n \n \nIn October 2005, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (eQIP). In response to question 27, financial record, he listed \nthe $4,870 garnishment for unpaid attorney\u2019s fees and a $1,500 garnishment for a major \ncredit card company. In response to question 28, financial delinquencies, he listed \n$3,765 owed his appellate attorney, $2,600 owed a credit card company, $4,021 owed \na credit card company, $441 owed on a credit card, and $2,500 owed on a credit card. \n \n \nA credit card company obtained a judgment against Applicant, which he paid by \ngarnishment from April 2005 to June 2006 and with money orders after July 2006. (Tr. \n51) In February 2008, the judgment was satisfied. (Ex. D) An action was brought by a \ncredit card company against Applicant and his ex-wife. In the CCCS material this debt \nwas listed as creditor 9 in the amount of $2,500. Applicant is unsure if this is the same \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1. c. (Tr. 54) In October 2007, the matter was dismissed without \nprejudice and could be re-filed. (Tr. 54, Ex. E) As of April 2008, Applicant had paid a law \nfirm approximately $1,800 by garnishment and money order on a judgment. (Ex G) \nApplicant paid $357.65 on another account. (Ex H) \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nOn May 5, 2008, Applicant sent letters (Ex. I) to eight creditors disputing that he \nwas solely responsible for the debts listed in the SOR \u00b6 1. b ($4,292), \u00b6 1.j ($379), and \n\u00b6 1.k ($22) He also sent letters asking that he be shown he was solely responsible for \ndebts which he previously admitted were his debts: SOR \u00b6 1. e ($365) (Ex. L, Creditor \n13) and SOR \u00b6 1. g ($665, acknowledged as a garnishment listed on his eQIP). He also \nsent letters to creditors listed in his credit report that are not listed as being debts of \nconcern on the SOR: two debts ($3,479 and $665, Tr. 94, SOR \u00b6 1. g) with the same \ncreditor, and a debt ($3,700) owed on another credit card. (Tr. 58) Applicant listed on \nhis CCCS form (Ex. Q, Creditor 3 and 5) he owed the creditor and acknowledged he \nhad a joint credit card with this creditor. (Tr. 152) This last creditor agreed to delete the \naccount from his credit report. (Ex. S) \n \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant submitted letters to creditors stating he was not \nsolely liable for the debt and demanding they show he was. Items 4 and 5 were utility \nbills (SOR \u00b6 1. h, $248 and SOR \u00b6 1. l, $165) on the home he and his now ex-wife \nowned before the divorce. Item 6 relates to a $37 medical bill (SOR \u00b6 1. a).  \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant received a notice to cure from a law firm related to the \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6 1. b ($4,292) and 1. c ($6,364). In July 2006, Applicant sent the \nlaw firm a letter disputing the debts because he had not done business with the listed \ncreditors. (Ex. R) The record fails to contain creditor\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s letter, \nhowever, the debts continue to appear on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. (Tr. 72) Applicant \nhas not followed up with the creditor since his initial 2006 response. (Tr. 120) \n \n \nApplicant lives in an apartment and has a 1993 pick up truck and a 1994 car. (Ex \nO) Since 2004, he has not been late on his rent. (Tr. 48, Ex. M) In April 2008, he paid \nhis work expenses and is current on his travel expenses. (Tr. 68, Ex. N) In May 2003, \nhe obtained an $18,000 loan from his IRA. (Ex. P) In June 2008, his last payment \nrepaying the loan was due.

(Tr. 74)  \n \n \nTotal of debts listed in \nSOR  \n \n$22,134 \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                          \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. The SOR lists 13 debts totaling approximately $22,000 that have remained \nunpaid since 2003. Six of the debts are under $400, ranging from $22 to $379. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant sought financial assistance from CCCS. He completed a form \nlisting the majority of the debts in the SOR. Different collection companies are \nattempting to collect some of the debt, so the names in the CCCS form and on the SOR \ndiffer. Applicant does not recognize the new collection companies. In October 2005, \nwhen Applicant completed his eQIP, he listed two garnishments and a number of past \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n8\ndue debts. In November 2007, when he answered financial written interrogatories, he \nagain acknowledged a number of the debts. Now he claims he will pay the debts if it is \nproven to him that they are his debts. They are his debt and he has not paid them. \n \n \nApplicant has written to various creditors asking they prove he was \u201csolely\u201d liable \non the debts and not jointly liable. Under the law, he is liable on his joint obligations. If \nthe divorce decree required his wife to pay a certain debt, he could seek financial \nredress from his ex-wife, but he would still be liable to the creditor to pay the debt.  \n \n \nEven the small utility bills (SOR \u00b6 1.jk, $22; SOR \u00b6 1.1, $165; SOR \u00b6 1.h, $248; \nand SOR \u00b6 1.j. 379) and the $37 clinic bill (SOR \u00b6 1.a) have not been paid. Applicant is \nmaking payment on his appellate attorney debt knowing his wages will be garnished if \nhe does not continue to make voluntary payments.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by his 2003 divorce. The debts were incurred long ago, but remain \nunpaid. The debts are frequent and his failure to pay them does cast doubt on his good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(b), Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ applies. Applicant was divorced, but that \noccurred five years ago and even the small bills from that divorce have yet to be paid. \nApplicant has not acted responsibility concerning the debts. Both his divorce attorney \nand his appellate attorney had to resort to garnishments for payment. Civil contempt \norders were required to force Applicant to comply with the judge\u2019s orders related to the \ndivision of property in the divorce. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nunder AG & 20(c), does not apply. Applicant went to CCCS, but received no financial \ncounseling. He merely completed some forms and was told he should file bankruptcy.  \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) which applies where the evidence shows Athe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,@ does \nnot apply. Payment by garnishment or making payment knowing garnishment is likely \nfails to show good faith. None of the other bills have been paid.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n9\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was 39 or 40 when he was \ndivorced. The divorce resulted in civil contempt under which Applicant spent 109 days in \njail. The divorce occurred five years ago and none of the bills have been paid. He took \nout a loan against his retirement plan and turned the check over to his ex-wife\u2019s \nattorney. He says, but provided no documentation, the funds were to pay joint \nobligations. This debt has now been repaid, but it was not a debt of concern listed in the \nSOR. None of the debts listed in the SOR have been paid.  \n \nApplicant does not appear to be living beyond his means. His vehicles are not \nnew and his has never been late on his rent in the past four years. The unpaid debt \nrelates to his divorce. There is no evidence of delinquent debt unrelated to the divorce. \n \nIn 2003, when he listed the debts in CCCS papers, in 2005, when he listed some \nof his debts on his eQIP, and in 2007, when he listed some debts in response to the \ninterrogatories, he acknowledged the debts were owed. Now, five years later, he is not \nsure the debts are his. I find they are his debts even if they were initially joint \nobligations. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, Applicant has \npaid none of his past due obligations and a clearance is not recommended, but should \nthe Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, \n\n \n \n \n10\nhaving paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance with a repayment plan, \nor otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence \nof his security worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a -1m.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 39 years old, divorced, and has a teen-aged daughter who has a son.  Applicant\nworks for a defense contractor.  She had financial difficulties in her early twenties after her divorce\n\n2\nand the loss of her job.  She resolved those problems by paying her creditors in a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy.  She mitigated the current financial problems by repaying all but $1,043.  She mitigated\nthe personal conduct security concern.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On January 10, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 31, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 6, 2007, I\nconvened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits\nthat were admitted into evidence, except Government Exhibit 5, the 2005 security clearance\napplication (SCA).  It was not admitted because Applicant objected on the basis it was not signed,\nand the Government did not move again for its admission at the end of the evidence (Tr. 18, 100).\nThe Government had no objection to Exhibits E to H submitted by Applicant within the additional\ntime allowed.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 39 years old, divorced in 1988, and has a 19-year-old daughter who has a two-\nyear-old son.  Applicant lives alone after being in an 11-year relationship with a man who had three\ndaughters.  During that relationship, Applicant worked and gave money to her boyfriend with which\nto pay the household debts.  She trusted him to pay those bills and did not keep her knowledge\ncurrent on those debts.  Her boyfriend did not work at all times during the relationship, placing the\nincome burden for the household on Applicant.  Applicant works for a defense contractor.  She is\nregarded as very competent and trustworthy by her supervisors.  She completes all tasks in a\nprofessional manner, including highly sensitive non-classified projects. (Tr. 13, 44, 45, 49, 60, 61,\n71; Exhibits 6, A-D)\nApplicant accumulated debts by 1991, when she was 22 years old, and the loss of her job\nthen, all of which led her to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  She could not make some payments and\nher parents told her instead that they would help pay her debts.  Applicant dismissed that first\nbankruptcy filing on August 23, 1991, on that understanding .  Her parents did not do so, and\nApplicant had to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy again on September 16, 1991.  That bankruptcy was not\ncompleted successfully and was dismissed on February 5, 1993.  A third and final time Applicant\nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on October 8, 1993, and it was successfully completed.  Applicant\nwas discharged in this bankruptcy on April 14, 1997.  Applicant does not remember the specific\n\n4\namount of the debt included in the final bankruptcy, but recalls it may have been about $10,000. (Tr.\n29-34, 94, 95; Exhibits 1, 2)\nApplicant has two incidents of writing checks without sufficient funds in her account to pay\nthese checks.  The first incident was in January 1991.  She pled no contest to the two charges, and\nreceived a sentence of 20 days in jail (suspended), and a fine of $216, $100 of which was suspended.\nThe second incident occurred on March 29, 1997.  Again, she pled no contest to the charge, and was\nfined $500.  Those fines were paid. (Tr. 70, 71; Exhibits 3-5)\nApplicant failed to file and pay her city income taxes in 1993, 1996 to 1998, 2000 to 2005.\nShe assumed her employer withheld the income tax from her pay checks.  She did not verify that\nassumption.  She did not file her city tax returns for some years, in particular 2003.  She claimed the\nfiling requirement \u201cslipped her mind.\u201d  Since April 3, 2007, she has an installment payment\nagreement with her residence city to pay $250 monthly to retire the $5,239.39 tax debt. (Tr. 67-71;\nExhibits F, G)\nApplicant has no credit cards.  She has her income, now about $3,000 monthly, directly\ndeposited into a savings account.  She pays her bills electronically by means of a computer or with\na money order.  She does not have a checking account because she remembers the problems she had\nin 1991 and 1995 with the insufficiently funded checks.  She tries to save about $400 monthly.  Her\nnet income monthly after expenses is about $950.  She has a budget in place for her income and\nexpenses.  Her grandson has a genetic ailment, and Applicant gives her daughter about $100 for\nmedications to cover expenses not paid by insurance.  She gives her daughter another $150 monthly\nto cover her expenses, because her daughter works part-time in a low-paying job.  Applicant had a\nhip replacement in 2006, causing her to miss some  work time.  Her insurance pays 80% of the cost,\nand Applicant has medical expenses to pay for the remaining 20% of the bills. Applicant wants to\nbuy a house and is trying to resolve her debts to clear her credit record.  Applicant intends to repay\nher debts one by one.  Applicant has a high school degree and a few college credits. (Tr. 37-40, 44,\n50, 55, 62-64, 81, 90; Exhibit H)\nApplicant has 13 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Two delinquent debts are listed twice.\nOf these debts, Applicant has paid two in full, and has installment payment agreements for five\ndebts.  The remaining four debts are disputed and total $1,043.  Specifically, the delinquent debts\nare as follows:\nSubparagraphs 1.j ($2,075 judgment) and 1.o ($1,179 judgment) are for the same\napartment rental debt.  The difference in amounts is not explained in any exhibit.  Both debts resulted\nfrom judgments on the same day of June 2003.  This debt is being paid at $100 monthly.  Applicant\nis saving her money to settle the debt for $700.  She has saved nearly that entire amount to be able\nto pay the settlement. (Tr. 43, 72; Exhibits 9, 10, Answer)\nSubparagraphs 1.k ($25 for a returned check) and 1.l ($108 for a returned check) were\npaid in October and November 2006, respectively. (Tr. 54, 76; Exhibits 9, 10, Answer)\nSubparagraph 1.m ($1,674 for utility bills) is being paid regularly, and now has an\namount due of $208. (Tr. 76, 77; Exhibits 9, E, Answer)\n\n5\nSubparagraph 1.n ($201 for a mail order business) is a debt Applicant denies as valid.\nShe claims her former boyfriend ordered something from this company, but she did not.  The name\nused to order the item consisted of her nickname and the boyfriend\u2019s last name.  It remains unpaid.\n(Tr. 35, 36, 78; Exhibit 9)\nSubparagraphs 1.p and 1.q are each for $213 for a hospital bill.  Applicant had\ninsurance with the company for whom she worked.  She attempted to have the insurance company\npay the bill, but it is unresolved at present.  She asked her former employer to check the status of the\npayment. (Tr. 37-40, 83; Exhibits 9, 10)\nSubparagraph 1.r (satellite television service bill for $391) is a debt not yet repaid.\n(Tr. 85; Exhibits 9, 10)\nSubparagraph 1.s is for a cell phone service provider.  Applicant denies she owes his\nbill because she never had service with that company.  She uses a pre-paid cell phone.  This debt\nremains unpaid, and Applicant disputes its validity. (Tr. 40, 85; Exhibits 9, 10, Answer)\nSubparagraph 1.t is a medical debt for $62.  She is paying the collection agency $50\nmonthly to repay this bill and several others that agency is collecting.  The total debt is about $300.\n(Tr. 86; Exhibits 9, 10, Answer)\nSubparagraph 1.u is for $130 owed on a tanning salon membership.  This debt is\nunpaid. (Tr. 87; Exhibit 9)\nSubparagraph 1.v is for a judgment from 2004 in the amount of $795.92.  Applicant\ndenies the validity of this debt.  It is not listed on the credit reports submitted as exhibits.  Applicant\nhas not paid this debt and disputes its validity. (Tr. 42; Exhibits 9, 10)\nApplicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (PTPA) on October 8, 2003.  She\ndid not list her disorderly conduct charge of January 2003.  She misread Question 16 because she\nthought the fine cutoff amount was $150, which was the amount of her fine.  She thought the date\nof her offense was 10 years ago, beyond the seven year limit of the question.  She had no explanation\nof why she thought that January 2003, charge was 10 years before October 2003.  Next, Question\n20 on the same PTPA asked Applicant if she had delinquent debts older than 180 days.  She\nanswered \u201cno\u201d because she asked her boyfriend, who paid the bills with the money she gave him,\nif any debts were that old.  He told her none were delinquent.  She did not keep track of the debts\nand relied on him to do so.  She claims she was not aware of the delinquencies until the Government\ninvestigator talked to her in 2006. (Tr. 13, 46-49, 90-92; Exhibits 3, 6, Answer)\nApplicant admitted she completed a security clearance application (SCA) on March 9, 2005.\nThis document was marked as Exhibit 5 for identification, but was not admitted into evidence.\nApplicant testified about the SCA at the hearing.  Applicant answered Question 26 on this SCA\nabout offenses for which she was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of in the past seven years,\nexcept traffic offenses with fines less than $150, with a \u201cno.\u201d  She again failed to list the 2003\ndisorderly conduct arrest and conviction.  She gave the same explanation for failing to list it in 2005\nas she did in 2003.  Applicant denied deliberately failing to list her 180 day delinquent debts in\nanswer to Question 38, or her current 90 day delinquent accounts in answer to Question 39, giving\n\n6\nas her reason her past reliance on her boyfriend who paid the household bills with the money she\ngave him. (Tr. 13, 46-49, 90-93; Exhibits 3, 6, Answer)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\n\n7\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations:  Applicant had financial difficulties from the time of her\nmarriage 18 years ago until 2006.  She incurred debts that she could not repay, due to a low income\nresulting from her high school education, a divorce, and lack of financial sophistication.  She filed\nChapter 13 bankruptcy three times between 1991 and 1993, unable to pay and complete the first two\nfilings.  Finally, she successfully completed the 1993 filing in 1997.  She failed to pay her city\nincome taxes for a number of years, because she thought the tax was deducted from her pay by her\nemployer, and at the same time she failed to file the tax returns with the city because the requirement\n\u201cslipped her mind.\u201d  The disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \u00b619.c. (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations), and \u00b619.g (failure to file annual local income tax returns).\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s successful Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1997 shows she tried to repay her creditors,\nnot just eradicate her debts.  That pattern of attempting to repay her debts is shown again in her\ncurrent efforts to repay the current delinquent debts.\nApplicant showed at the hearing she is making efforts to repay her debts to clear her financial\nrecord in preparation to buying a house.  She has installment payment agreements with several\ncreditors, and has repaid two.  The SOR contains four allegations that should be only two because\nof duplications on the credit reports.  Only three debts remain unpaid at present (Subparagraphs 1.r,\n1.s, and 1.u), totaling $842.  She disputes Subparagraphs 1.s and 1.n as not being her debts.  A\ndelinquent debt total of $842, plus the disputed debt contained in Subparagraph 1.n for $201 equals\nonly $1,043, not a significant amount.  \nApplicant\u2019s explanation why her local income taxes were not paid for several years has two\nreasonable bases.  First, the time periods coincide with the 11 years she spent living with her former\nboyfriend who was not paying bills as she expected.  Second, her expectation that her employers\nwould withhold income taxes from her paychecks.  This second expectation is a reasonable one,\ncompounded by her obvious lack of financial sophistication and higher education.  She made a\nmistake about the tax process, and relied on her assumptions based on state and federal income taxes\nbeing withheld.  She trusted her live-in boyfriend more than she should have.\nThe Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions applicable are \u00b620.b (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and \u00b620.e (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue).  Applicant demonstrated an awareness and dedication to control her finances and repay\nher debts, pre-dating the SOR.  Applicant expressed her intention to repay her debts one by one, and\nhas submitted proof  that she is doing so.  It is likely that she will continue paying off her unpaid\ndebts based on her performance to date.  \nPersonal Conduct:  Applicant did not disclose certain information as alleged in the SOR\non her 2003 PTPA.  She did not disclose the same information on her 2005 SCA, as alleged in the\nSOR.  She explained both failures occurred because she misread the question on the $150 traffic\noffenses, and did not believe it applied to  her situation.  As to the questions related to delinquent\ndebts, she relied on her former live-in boyfriend\u2019s statements and did not personally review her\nfinancial matters. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (DC) which applies is \u00b616.(a) involving deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, or determine trustworthiness.  If the failure to disclose is deliberate, then this DC\napplies.  \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s explanations of why she did not disclose the same information on two\nGovernment forms is reasonable, credible, and persuasive.  She misread the first question on the fine\n\n9\nminimums for disclosure.  She did not read the question carefully enough to understand it applied\nto minor traffic fines.  She also miscalculated the disclosure period for her disorderly conduct charge,\nwhich she repeated at the hearing, showing a deficit of math skills primarily.  Her offense was minor\nand that behavior was infrequent in her life.  Regarding the debts, she relied on what her live-in\nboyfriend told her about their debts.  She trusted, but did not verify.  She did not learn of her\ndelinquent debts until the Government investigator told her what they were in 2006.  The same errors\nbeing made on two forms completed two years apart shows the same mind-set and detrimental\nreliance on her boyfriend and her math abilities.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nApplicant\u2019s testimony is credible and persuasive on her medical and family ailments and debt\nobligations.  She married and was divorced at an early age.  She has a minimally employed single\ndaughter whose son has a chronic medical condition.  She is also credible and persuasive in her\ntestimony about her efforts to repay her debts.  She admitted she previously spent money on\nshopping for items, but has stopped doing so.  She reduced her discretionary spending.  Her unpaid\ndebts total approximately $1,043 and not the $7,000 listed in the SOR..  She is saving money and\nworking to repay her debts, and is resolved to control her spending in the future.  She does not have\nany credit cards and no checking account, reducing the opportunities for overspending.  Her\nbankruptcies resulted from her divorce and job loss in 1991.  She learned from her earlier problems\nand mistakes.  She rehabilitated herself by identifying the problems and correcting them.  Her debt\nrepayment actions are recent, but debt accumulation is not recent in the past two years.  Applicant\nis trying to live responsibly.  Her mistakes on her PTPA and SCA resulted from misunderstanding\nand detrimental reliance.  She had no deceptive motivation for her conduct.  Based on the evidence\nApplicant presented, there is little likelihood of recurrence.  \nFurthermore, without Exhibit 5, and with her denials of Subparagraphs 2.d and 2.e, the\nfindings on those allegations must be for Applicant.  Applicant objected to Exhibit 5 and its\nadmission, and it was never admitted into evidence.  The Government\u2019s stated (Tr. 100, 101) that\nit did not put the document into evidence and were not pursuing those allegations, although the\nGovernment mistakenly referred to Exhibit 6 instead of Exhibit 5.  I assume Exhibit 5 was the\ncorrect reference and the two allegations Applicant denied.\nTherefore, considering all of the evidence, I conclude the financial considerations security\nconcern for Applicant.  I also conclude the personal conduct security concern for Applicant.  Finally,\nI conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d for Applicant based on her continued efforts to repay her\ndebts and not avoid them, her evaluations from her supervisors, and the totality of her explanations\nand the evidence introduced.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes more than $25,000 in delinquent debt incurred in his name or for which he\nis contractually liable. While his spouse was handling the family\u2019s finances, and he is presently in\ndivorce proceedings in part because of the unpaid debt, Applicant failed to ensure that debts he\nknowingly incurred were paid on time. Efforts to resolve his financial situation, undertaken in\nresponse to court actions by his creditors, are not enough to overcome the financial considerations\nconcerns. Personal conduct concerns exist because be falsely denied any financial delinquencies\nwhen he completed his November 2005 security clearance application. Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on April 3, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nallegations in the SOR on May 8, 2007. By letter dated May 25, 2007, Applicant was directed to\nindicate whether or not he wished to have a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. On June\n6, 2007, Applicant declined a hearing.\nOn June 27, 2007, the government notified Applicant that it was requesting a hearing in his\ncase. On July 30, 2007, the government moved to amend the SOR to add seven new allegations\nunder Guideline F (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s through 1.y), and to amend Guideline E to incorporate those debts\namong those allegedly concealed when he completed his November 2005 security clearance\napplication (e-QIP). On August 3, 2007, the case was assigned to a DOHA administrative judge to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. The case was transferred to me on August 6, 2007, because of Applicant\u2019s\nwork location.\nOn August 7, 2007, Applicant requested a hearing at the earliest date available. I scheduled\na hearing for August 23, 2007, near Applicant's duty station. Also on August 7, 2007, I ordered\nApplicant to inform me by August 17, 2007, of good cause to deny the proposed amendments to the\nSOR  Applicant was notified that in the absence of a timely objection, the SOR would be amended,\nand he would be expected to answer the new allegations, either admit or deny, at his upcoming\nhearing. Applicant filed no response by the due date.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 23, 2007. Before the introduction of\nevidence, the SOR was amended and Applicant filed his answers to the new allegations. The\ngovernment submitted five exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and Applicant four exhibits (Ex. A-D) and testimony\nwas taken from the Applicant, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 5, 2007. Based\non the evidence presented, the government withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.s.\nThe record was held open until September 24, 2007, for Applicant to submit documentation\nof his divorce proceedings and/or other financial records. Applicant timely forwarded a letter from\nhis divorce attorney (Ex. E), a statement of payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Ex. F), and a letter\nshowing the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Ex.G). The government had no objections, and the\ndocuments were admitted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, as amended, Applicant was alleged to owe 25 delinquent debts totaling\nabout $64,952 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.y).  Under Guideline E, as amended, Applicant is alleged to have\nfalsified his November 2005 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by\ndenying that he was over 180 days delinquent on any debt and that he was currently over 90 days\n\nOn his e-QIP, Applicant indicated he had been living at the same address since 1995. Assuming the home he\n1\nlived in was destroyed by fire in September 2000, then the residency information he provided on his e-QIP is not\naccurate.\n3\ndelinquent on any debt. Applicant initially admitted the debts in the SOR with the exception of SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.i, and averred he was working on resolving the debts. During the course of the\nhearing, it became clear that Applicant had admitted only some of the debts because they appeared\non his credit report (\u201cI mean if that\u2019s what the credit report says, then I believe it to be accurate.\u201d\nTr. 75). He denied any knowledge of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.p. 1.q, 1.r, 1.d, 1.u, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y.\nApplicant also denied that the deliberately falsified his e-QIP, averring that he had been unaware\nof his financial situation until sometime after he completed his security clearance application.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since December\n2005. He came to his present location in March 2007 on loan from another subsidiary of the same\ncorporation, but in July 2007 transferred to his present employer. Applicant held a confidential-level\nclearance when he worked for the \u201csister company.\u201d His current duties in the engineering/planning\nof repair and upgrade of military vessels do not require access to classified information, but he will\nneed a clearance for access to a classified area as the job progresses.\nApplicant worked as a mechanic until his brother, a college professor, convinced him to\npursue his undergraduate degree. In September 1998, he matriculated in a local community college.\nHe worked as a janitor and tutor part-time. With the demands of schooling and work, his spouse took\nover the handling of the family\u2019s finances. His spouse was employed as a receptionist in a medical\noffice. In September 2000, he began engineering studies at the state university. That same month,\nhe and his spouse lost everything in a house fire.   They were renting from his brother, and had\n1\ninsurance but it covered less than half of their personal property loss. His spouse was too\nemotionally distraught to work for about a year. She collected temporary disability payments for part\nof the time and then unemployment compensation until those benefits ran out.\nFrom June 2001 until Applicant finished college, he held an internship with a local\nconsulting firm that dealt in oceanographic matters. His spouse returned to work as a medical\nreceptionist in about September 2001, but after about a year, she quit and has not been back to work.\nApplicant indicates he was unaware that her disability and then unemployment payments had\nstopped. (Tr. 94)\nApplicant earned his bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in May 2003, and\nbegan working locally as an application engineer for a foreign-owned company involved in\noceanographic instrumentation. His annual salary was about $47,000. His job took him away from\nhome at least 50 percent of the time, and as compensation, his employer gave him the money for a\ncruise that he took to Mexico in April 2004. In December 2004, Applicant got laid off when the\ncompany closed its U.S. operations. His unemployment compensation was about 65% of his\nprevious base salary.\nIn June 2005, Applicant took what he considered to be a temporary position with a company\ndoing oceanographic measurements. In November 2005, Applicant accepted a job offer from the\n\n4\ndefense contractor at an annual salary of almost $52,000. Needing a secret clearance for his expected\nduties with the defense contractor,  Applicant completed an Electronics Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) on November 22, 2005. Applicant responded negatively to\nquestions 28 a [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d] and\n28 b [\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d].\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 14, 2005, revealed several accounts had been\ncharged off and/or placed for collection since 2003. Some of the accounts had been opened in\nApplicant\u2019s name alone or jointly with his spouse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o,\n1.p, 1.t) and others by his spouse with him as an authorized user (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.u, 1.w).

(Ex. F). In March 2006, the assignee filed for a judgment in small claims court.\nApplicant paid $50 per month ($850 total) toward the debt beginning April 20, 2006. \nFrom March to May 2006, he was on an extended work assignment at a shipyard located\nmore than 3,000 miles from his home. In May 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government\ninvestigator about his finances. He provided a personal financial statement estimating a net monthly\nremainder of $260 after payment of living expenses, $435 in a mortgage loan, and $150 to lawyers\ntowards debts in collection. He now claims he was unaware of the delinquencies until his May 2006\ninterview, and that the $150 in claimed payments did not represent actual payments but rather\nanticipated payments based on what he could afford.\nIn or before June 2006, the assignee collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o sought a legal judgment\nin the amount of $2,688.27 ($2,583.27 plus costs, see Ex. 2 , Ex. D). Applicant offered to repay the\ndebt at $50 per month before the formal judgment was entered, and his offer was accepted by the\ncollection agency. As of August 2007, Applicant had paid $650 towards the debt (Tr. 161).\nOn July 31, 2006, an arbitrator ordered Applicant to pay $8,666.22 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h.\nOn October 10, 2006, the assignee collecting the debt filed for an order and judgment confirming\nthe arbitration award plus costs. By letter dated November 22, 2006, Applicant offered to pay $50\nper month toward the debt, representing that it was all that his finances would allow (Ex. 2).\nApplicant made his first payment on the debt on July 10, 2007. He made a second payment\napproximately one month later.\n\nDOHA is not likely to have inquired about specific contacts with a debt resolution firm unless Applicant told\n2\nthe government about it. Yet there is nothing in the record to confirm that Applicant had claimed to be working through\na debt resolution company. The discrepancy was not resolved at the hearing.\nApplicant initially testified he asked for a divorce in October 2006 (Tr. 63), and his spouse filed for divorce\n3\nin March 2007(Tr. 57). He later testified he asked for the divorce in September 2006, and she filed in February 2007 (Tr.\n95).\n7\nThe assignee collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f filed a small claims action to recover a\n$3,211.23 balance. On October 31, 2006, Applicant offered to repay the debt at $70 monthly,\nstarting November 20, 2006. As of August 27, 2007, Applicant had paid $700 towards the debt\nbringing the balance with interest to $3,016.20  (Ex. 2, Ex. G).\nBy September 2006, Applicant and his spouse were having marital problems, in part due to\nher handling of their financial affairs, including that she had kept delinquency information from him.\nWhile he was out of state on temporary duty, he told her he wanted a divorce. He continued to give\nher $500 per week to cover their expenses, including rent, and for the mortgage on the home they\nown.\nIn late November or early December 2006, DOHA forwarded financial interrogatories to\nApplicant, requesting proof that he was working with a debt solutions firm allegedly named by him\nduring his May 2006 interview. DOHA also asked Applicant what he was doing to satisfy the debts\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.o, 1.e, 1.f, 1.p., 1.w, 1.k, 1.t, 1.m, 1.h, 1.i, 1.g, 1.d, and why he had not listed those\ndebts on his security clearance application. On December 14, 2006, Applicant responded he was\nunfamiliar with the debt resolution firm that DOHA claimed he had said he was working with.2\nInstead, he indicated he was dealing with the creditors individually, and he provided correspondence\nconfirming efforts to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.o. Applicant attributed his\nfinancial difficulties to the house fire in September 2000 when he was a full-time student, his\nspouse\u2019s subsequent inability to work, their use of credit to cover living costs, and his spouse\u2019s\ndisability status. Applicant indicated that he was \u201cworking slowly and diligently to pay off the\nfinancial obligations that [he has] while making sure [he did] not put [himself] in the same situation\nagain.\u201d Concerning his failure to disclose his debts on the e-QIP, Applicant indicated without\nexplanation that  he misunderstood the questions and he was not trying to deny his responsibility.\nIn February or March 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse filed for divorce, although she and Applicant\nhad agreed previously to share the same attorney.  She obtained a court order that required him to\n3\npay alimony of $500 every two weeks, but in April 2007 it was reduced to $400 per week. About\n$445 of those funds is to cover the monthly mortgage payment on the home they own.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 6, 2007, showed progress in satisfying the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a, but it also showed a recent utility company debt placed for collection in December 2006\nin the amount of $131. Applicant was out of state at the time working and his spouse had run up the\nbill, and disconnected the service only to open a new account in her name. The credit bureau\nreported delinquent debt totaling $38,388.\n\nApplicant testified he is going to assume $25,000 of the marital debt (Tr. 60). His attorney\u2019s letter does not\n4\nindicate any dollar limit as to the amount of the debt Applicant will assume (see Ex. E).\n8\nIn March 2007, Applicant\u2019s services were loaned out to his present employer. He was paid\nabout 10 percent more while on this temporary assignment through June 2007. On his transfer to his\ncurrent employer in July 2007, Applicant\u2019s base annual salary increased almost 25 percent, to\n$66,000 annually. He supplements his income with a catering business on the side,  from which he\nearns about $500 per month. As of August 2007, he was on a housing relocation package so had no\nrental obligation, but he had signed a lease to rent a residence at $600 per month effective mid-\nSeptember 2007. He estimates he will have about $400 left over each month after payment of\nexpenses and the $220 towards his old debts. For the last three to four seasons of winter hockey,\nApplicant has held season tickets to attend American Hockey League games.\nApplicant had a court hearing for his divorce scheduled for September 19, 2007, after which\nhe hoped to provide information regarding the distribution of assets and liabilities in the divorce.\nOn September 19, 2007, the matter was continued to November 1, 2007. Applicant has proposed that\nhe and his spouse split the marital debts and equity in the home equally, and that he pay alimony for\nabout four years until his spouse qualifies for social security benefits. Applicant estimates his share\nof the equity in the home to be about $30,000 minus any realtor commission from the sale. In the\nalternative, Applicant proposes that he assume responsibility for the debts that are in his name\nindividually, or jointly with his spouse, in return for paying no alimony and waiver of his interest\nin the home.4\nApplicant has not incurred any new credit card debt since 2004. In July 2007, his brother\npurchased a 2007-model year pickup truck for him. Applicant is repaying his brother $510 per\nmonth for the vehicle.\nApplicant conducted himself in a very professional manner in his work for a defense\ncontractor since December 2005, including while on temporary duty in 2006 into 2007. A diligent\nand motivated employee, he demonstrated a high degree of accountability and ethical behavior on\nthe job. He is held in high regard by those who have had the opportunity to work with him or\nobserve his work.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n\nSome of the debts were likely alleged twice, under the names of the original creditor and the subsequent\n5\nassignee (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.l, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.s, \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. and 1.v, \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.x, \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.u). Of the debts that the\ngovernment added in the amendment, the evidence was sufficient to prove the additional delinquency in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and\n1.w only.\n9\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) \nFinances were tight after Applicant started college in 1998. Applicant or his spouse in his\nname opened several credit card accounts over the next three years to pay for living expenses, and\nto reestablish themselves after a house fire in 2000.  Several accounts were charged off in the\n2003/04 time frame due to nonpayment. Of the $64,952 in delinquent debt alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant has delinquent debt on his record totaling about  $32,363.50,  not including an additional\n5\n$8,680  owed on an account opened by his spouse on which he was listed as an authorized user.\nWhile it is not clear that he incurred the charges, the debt is reported on his March 2007 credit\nrecord as a past due balance. While some of the debts were apparently incurred by his spouse\nwithout his knowledge (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.p, 1.u), other accounts were actively used\nby him or known to him (most notably SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.t, 1.w). Applicant\nknew that after their house fire, they had incurred significant credit card debt for living expenses and\nrefurnishing their home. Disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, and \u00b6 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply.\nThe house fire is an extenuating factor that explains the reliance on credit in 2000/01 (see\n\u00b6 20(b), the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), although\nconcerns are raised by the extent to which they took on new debt when she was out of work and he\nwas a full-time student. For \u00b6 20(b) to apply in his favor, Applicant must have acted reasonably to\naddress his indebtedness once he was in a position to do so. On earning his bachelor\u2019s degree, he\ntook a job paying $47,000 per year. Given the significant travel involved with that job, he left the\nfamily\u2019s finances to his spouse, and he contends she failed to apprise him of their financial situation\n(\u201cI trusted her.\u201d Tr. 97). Yet on occasion he handled some of the debts (\u201cI did on occasion write\n\n10\nsome [checks] or, you know, go online and make a payment.\u201d Tr. 101) Failure to adequately monitor\nrepayment of known financial obligations is itself financially irresponsible behavior.\nSince he began working for a defense contractor in December 2005, Applicant has paid  $850\non SOR \u00b6 1.a, $700 on SOR \u00b6 1.f, $100 on SOR \u00b6 1.h, and $650 on SOR \u00b6 1.o. While these\npayments weigh in his favor, they were not initiated by him, but were in response to creditor\nassignee action to recoup payment, including through court proceedings. Applicant made his first\npayment on the debt in \u00b6 1.a after the creditor had initiated action in small claims court. In June\n2006, Applicant stipulated to a court judgment being entered against him and for him to repay the\ndebt in \u00b6 1.o at $50 monthly. Applicant knew that an arbitrator had found against him in the amount\nof $8,666.22 on July 31, 2006, but he made no payments on the debt in \u00b6 1.h until the creditor went\nto court in October 2006 seeking an order to enforce the arbitration award.  He offered to pay $50\nper month in November 2006, but the first payment was not made on the debt in \u00b6 1.h until July\n2007.  Similarly, the creditor assignee collecting the debt in \u00b6 1.f had to file in court before\nApplicant started paying on it. These recent payments, although made on agreed upon terms, are not\nenough to apply MC \u00b6 20(d), the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts, especially considering his lack of any effort to contact his other creditors.\nFollowing his interview of May 2006 with a government investigator, Applicant was clearly aware\nof the seriousness of his financial situation, and he made no effort to contact the creditors who had\nnot resorted to legal action. When asked about his failure to address the $80 debt owed the telephone\ncompany, he explained he wanted to make sure that his financial situation will allow him to make\nthe payments on the debts he has worked out with attorneys (\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make sure that my\nfinances will allow me to pay the debts that I\u2019ve worked out with these other attorneys without\nputting me in any other financial situations so I don\u2019t go deeper.\u201d Tr. 98) At the same time, he\napparently found the money to afford season tickets for minor league professional hockey games\nfor the past three or four years (see Ex. A).\nAlthough the Directive does not require that Applicant be debt free, the risk of undue\nfinancial pressure persists where the delinquent debt in his name and/or for which he is contractually\nliable amounts to as much as half of his annual salary. As of September 2007, there had been no\nfinal order either requiring his spouse to sell their home, which would give him the equity to devote\nto the debt, or making his spouse responsible for a significant amount of the delinquent debt listed\non his credit record. It is premature at this juncture to conclude that his financial problems are safely\nin the past. Even though he has not personally incurred any new credit card debt in the last couple\nyears, he is paying his brother $510 monthly for a new truck that his brother bought for him because\nof his poor credit rating.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\n Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nOn his November 22, 2005 e-QIP, Applicant responded negatively to questions 28.a [\u201cIn the\nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d] and 28.b [\u201cAre you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d].  His December 2005 credit report disclosed more than\n\n11\n$25,000 in bad debt on his record, most of it charged off and/or placed for collection in 2003/04.\nApplicant has consistently denied the intentional concealment of his delinquent debt. In his\nDecember 2006 response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated he misunderstood the questions and\nwas not trying to avoid his responsibility. He provided a different explanation when he answered\nthe SOR, indicating for the first time that he had been unaware of his financial situation when he\ncompleted his clearance application. A good faith misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge of his\nfinancial situation would negate the willful intent required under DC \u00b6 16(a), deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Several character references consider Applicant to be honest and\na person of integrity. But the inconsistencies in his explanations, when coupled with the extent of\nhis debt, make it especially difficult to accept his denial of intentional concealment.\nConsidering only those revolving charge accounts opened in his name and/or knowingly used\nby him, $7,654 had been charged off in April 2004 on \u00b6 1.h, $4,338 had been charged off in April\n2005 on \u00b6 1.e, $2,934 had been charged off in October 2003 on \u00b6 1.o, $1,851 had been charged off\non \u00b6 1.a in January 2004, $1,281 had been charged off in May 2004 on \u00b6 1.k, a $506 balance was\n180 days past due as of April 2004 on \u00b6 1.t, $480 had been charged off in March 2004 on \u00b6 1.n, and\n$439 had been charged off in September 2003 on \u00b6 1.m. Applicant admitted at his hearing that he\nknew some of the accounts might have been late (\u201cI knew some of them night have been late but I\ndidn\u2019t know anything was past 90 days and that type of situation, no.\u201d Tr. 103).  Had he acted in\ngood faith, it stands to reason that he would have at least checked on the status of his financial\naccounts. At a minimum, he had an obligation to determine the status of those debts that he thought\nmight be late before he answered the e-QIP. An inference of intentional falsification may reasonably\nbe drawn in this case. The personal conduct concerns are not mitigated when Applicant has yet to\nprovide a consistent, credible explanation for his clearly false answers to the financial delinquency\nquestions on his e-QIP. None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a))\nAlthough  extenuating circumstances (house fire, spouse\u2019s unemployment) explain Applicant\u2019s\noveruse of credit, he did not ensure that debts were paid once he began working. Efforts to address\nhis delinquent debt were prompted by the creditors taking court action and not initiated by him, and\nhe has not done enough on his own to resolve the financial considerations concerns (see 2(a)(6), the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes)). Applicant has\nshown himself to be a very dedicated, reliable coworker for the defense contractor, but those with\na clearance must also be counted on to be fully candid at all times, even if it comes at personal cost.\nConcerns persist as to whether Applicant\u2019s representations can be relied on, given his failure to\nprovide a consistent, credible explanation for the clearly false denials of any delinquent debt on his\ne-QIP.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated security concerns arising from delinquent debts caused by periods of\nunemployment of herself, her husband, and failure of her former husband to pay child support. All\nthree conditions have now been resolved and she is making payments or arrangements to pay on all\nof the debts for which she is responsible. She also mitigated the personal conduct security concern\narising from denial on her SF 85 P of delinquent debts of over 180 days by showing that it was not\ndeliberate. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn April 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for an ADP clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether such a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nOn May 18, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on June 22, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on August 28, 2007,\nfor a hearing on September 11, 2007, which was held that day. The government offered five exhibits\nand Applicant offered one exhibit in evidence. All were accepted. The record was left open for two\nmonths for Applicant\u2019s submission of additional material. The transcript was received on September\n19, 2007. Three post-hearing submissions were made. The first consisting of four document was\nmade on September 12, 2007; the second consisting of six documents was made on October 14,\n2007; and a third consisting of five documents was made on November 12, 2007. All documents\nwere admitted in evidence without objection. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations of delinquent debts under the financial considerations\nsecurity concern and one allegation under personal conduct regarding erroneous information on her\napplication for trustworthiness determination (SF 85 P).\nApplicant is a 37-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor health\nprovider. She obtained this employment in 2006 after a period of unemployment from 2001 to 2003\nand temporary employment in 2004 and 2005 (Exh. 1). She was divorced on February 6, 2002, which\ncaused additional financial hardship. She began paying some debts a year after obtaining her present\njob and has been doing so for the past ten months (Tr. 19). She did not take action concerning some\nof the other delinquent debts until after the hearing in this matter, but she provided information in\nher three  post-hearing submissions concerning the actions she has taken to resolve the debts and the\nstatus of each of them.\nApplicant has one son age 16 about whom she has a court order included in her divorce\ndecree to receive child support from her former husband (Exh. B 6). He was unemployed for a\nperiod, but is now employed and paying the child support payments and on an arrearage of\napproximately $5,000 (Tr. 20). \nApplicant\u2019s four largest delinquent debts are as follows with the status of payments and\narrangements with creditors:\n1. SOR 1.c. The largest debt is for education loans for $16,555 which was 90 days\ndelinquent. Applicant is now paying on this loan and it is now current (Exh. A). \n2. SOR 1.g. A debt for $8,143 is from credit card debt that became delinquent in 2004.\n\n3\nPayments are being made on this debt of $20 per month with a plan for payment in full by a date\ncertain (Exhs. B 2 and 4).  \n3. SOR 1.b. Auto re-possession in 2002 for $3,196 which was a subject in the Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce decree in 2002 that made her husband responsible for the debt (Exh. B 6). \n4. SOR 1.f. A debt to the college she attended of $1,475 is covered by an agreement with the\ncollege for monthly payment of $20 which she has begun with a fixed date for final payment (Exh.\nC 1). \nA large number of the remaining debts totaling approximately $5,000 concern medical costs\nand other credit card debts which accumulated during her periods of unemployment and under-\nemployment. Some have been resolved and others are still the subject of discussions between\nApplicant and the creditor. They are as follows:\n1. SOR 1. m. and n. Two credit card debts totaling $348 for which payments of $45 per\nmonth are being made per agreement with the creditor (Exh. C 2). \n2. SOR 1.k. Delinquent debt of $635 which is the subject of an agreement requiring monthly\npayments of $25 which has begun (Exh. B 5).\n3. SOR 1.d. Delinquent debt of $983 is being investigated by Applicant. She has been in\ncontact with the attorney for the creditor who asks for half payment, but there is a good prospect to\nwork out a settlement amount in January 2008. (Exh. C 3). \n4. SOR 1.i. and j. Two hospital bills from same hospital of $713 and $598. Arrangements\nmade with creditor and payments of $25 per month have begun (Exh. C 5). \n5. SOR 1.a. and h. Investigating these debts of $860 and $1490 as possibly for rent or\ntelephone since to the same creditor and became due close to same time. Applicant has been in\ncontact with creditor who demands a large initial payment before documentation can be provided.\nShe is working on a settlement with the creditors (Exh. C 3). \n6. SOR 1.l. Court fee of $244 now reduced to $24. (Exh. C 3). \n7. SOR 1.o., p., q. and e. These four debts are each for only near $100. Contact has been\nmade with all four and contact names provided (Exh. C 3). Some payments have been made on all\nfour debts. \nWhen Applicant completed her SF 85 P she discussed her financial problems with her\ncompany security staff and advised them that she had credit problems. When she answered Question\n20 relating to delinquent debts of 180 days, she erroneously answered it in the negative (Tr. 12-13).\nThe company advised her after it had been submitted that she had made a mistake. She requested a\nhearing to explain the circumstances as well as her delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s salary is $25,000 per annum and she brings home approximately $800 every two\nweeks. Her husband is in the construction business and makes between $40,000 and $50,000 per\n\n4\nannum. Earlier in 2007, he was unemployed for a period which added to the financial problems but\nhe is now fully employed. The family expenses and payment obligations are modest, and they are\nable to resolve the legitimate outstanding delinquent debts.\nApplicant is highly regarded for her work skills and especially her manner of dealing with\nmilitary personnel who have difficulties in collecting from insurance (Exh. C 4). She  has an\nassociate degree from a community college. \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to ...control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\n. that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988). In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\u201d\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R,\nAppendix 8. An administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and\ncarefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person. Id. An administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations. \nA person granted access to sensitive information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment. The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to sensitive information. The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance or a trustworthiness determination is not a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant. Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts cited in the SOR prompted the allegation of a security concern\nunder Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), since an individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), or evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\n(AG \u00b6 19 a). The financial situation of Applicant warranted the security concerns stated in the\nGuidelines. \nMitigating Conditions (MC) include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (AG \u00b6 20 b), and there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20 c). I am confident Applicant has taken\nsufficient steps to resolve the debts and will follow through on the remainder since she is aware of\nthe possible jeopardy to her job and wants very much to avoid losing it. The unemployment and\nunder-employment of Applicant and her husband, as well as the failure of her former husband to\nmake child support payments justifies a conclusion that her financial situation was beyond her\ncontrol. Since this case arose, she has undertaken the effort to contact her creditors, establish\npayment plans when she could, and make payments on many of  them. Several payments began over\na year ago and she completed the effort to contact creditors, make agreements with them, and begin\npayments in the last 90 days. Thus, both mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThe Government established the allegation under Guideline E Personal Conduct alleged in\nthe SOR. The alleged false statement on her SF 85 P raised issues that might indicate questionable\njudgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (AG \u00b6 15) The specific condition\n\n6\napplicable to this case is deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nand material matters to an investigator, or other official representative could raise a security concern\nand be disqualifying (AG \u00b6 16 b.). \nThe false answer of Applicant must also have been deliberate according to the guideline.\nApplicant presented a credible case of the circumstances of the erroneous information. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it since the proof\nof omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. The record evidence as a whole must be analyzed to determine whether there\nis direct or circumstantial evidence concerning intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. Considering the evidence in the record, I conclude that the error was inadvertent and not\ndeliberate. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to sensitive  information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the process for adjudicating trustworthiness determinations is the\nfair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to\nsensitive information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the\ntotality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis. \nApplicant impressed me at the hearing as a competent person who is hard-working and\ndiligent. She is grateful to be employed in a job where she is appreciated for her work. Her\ndelinquent debts accumulated as a result of matters largely beyond her control, but now that she is\nemployed she is seeking to remedy them and has made significant progress in doing so. I believe\nshe is trustworthy and has shown her good faith in pursuing the resolution of the debts. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude in favor of the grant of a trustworthiness determination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a company that provides services to the Defense Department. She has worked in this job since 2005. Her job involves having access to unclassified information. In conjunction with her employment, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public trust positions (Standard Form 85P) in October 2005. 2. Applicant has a history of financial problems, as evidenced by derogatory information in credit reports from 2006 and 2007. The public record section of the 2006 credit report revealed five judgments against Applicant, one of which was satisfied. In addition, the report revealed a number of collection and charged-off accounts. The 2007 credit report further revealed or confirmed Applicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history. It revealed the same five judgments, and it also listed a number of collection and charged-off accounts. 3. The SOR alleges that Applicant has 18 delinquent debts for more than $29,000.

Eligibility is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reviewed Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\noccupy an automated data processing (ADP) position designated as an ADP I, II, or III position to\nsupport a contract with the Defense Department. This case involves an adjudication of Applicant\u2019s\neligibility to occupy an ADP position, not an adjudication of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance. As a result of the review, the agency recommended Applicant\u2019s case be submitted to an\nadministrative judge for a determination whether Applicant is eligible to occupy such a position. \nActing under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive), DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 11, 2006.  The\n1\nSOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action\nand alleges a concern under Guideline F for financial considerations based on multiple delinquent\ndebts, to include student loans and unpaid judgments. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005. The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  They apply to\n2\nthis case because (1) the SOR is dated December 11, 2006, and (2) this case qualifies as an other\ndetermination. Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. A copy of the\nrevised guidelines was provided to Applicant along with the SOR. \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR in writing on January 3, 2007. She elected to have her\ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nOn January 31, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by her February 12, 2007. Applicant\u2019s reply\nto the FORM is a two-page letter, dated March 5, 2007, with a one-page enclosure. It was reviewed\nby department counsel who voiced no objections, and it is admitted into the record as Exhibit A. The\ncase was assigned to me April 3, 2007.   \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR is mixed. She denied or disagreed with the indebtedness\nalleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p. She admitted or agreed with the\nindebtedness alleged in the remaining subparagraphs. Her admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact, and I make the following findings of fact.\n1.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a company that provides services to the Defense\nDepartment. She has worked in this job since 2005. Her job involves having access to unclassified\ninformation. In conjunction with her employment, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public\ntrust positions (Standard Form 85P) in October 2005.\n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, as evidenced by derogatory information in\ncredit reports from 2006 and 2007. The public record section of the 2006 credit report revealed five\njudgments against Applicant, one of which was satisfied. In addition, the report revealed a number\nof collection and charged-off accounts. The 2007 credit report further revealed or confirmed\nApplicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history. It revealed the same five judgments, and it also listed a\nnumber of collection and charged-off accounts. \n3.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 18 delinquent debts for more than $29,000. Based on the\nevidence as a whole, I find by substantial evidence that the record evidence establishes all 18\ndelinquent debts. In particular, proof of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is found in the 2006 and 2007\ncredit reports. Her delinquent indebtedness includes two student loans for more than $12,000.\n4.\nIn her reply to the FORM, Applicant provided written responses about her indebtedness. She\nmade a brief statement for each debt that further admitted or denied the debt. Except for her student\nloans, she did not provide any documentary evidence establishing proof of payment, proof of\nsettlement, proof of a repayment agreement, or proof of some step taken to dispute or resolve the\ndebts in question. For example, such proof might include court records (satisfaction of judgments),\nreceipts, copies of cancelled checks, account statements, bank statements, and correspondence (by\nmail or e-mail) verifying the status of delinquent accounts or repayment agreements with creditors.\n5.\nConcerning her delinquent student loans, Applicant has been in a loan-rehabilitation program\nmaking payments for the last ten months. She stated that after her March 2007 payment, the loans\nwill be considered current. A copy of a debt-collection bill from the U.S. Education Department,\nwith a due date of March 8, 2007, reflects that Applicant is making monthly payments on two\nstudent loans with a current total balance of $14,878.\n6.\nAs evidence of her trustworthiness, Applicant pointed out that she held a security clearance\nwhen she worked for the U.S. Navy in 1994, and she has worked for other companies where she has\nhad access to sensitive information. She never mishandled such information, and she asserts she\nwould not do so despite her financial situation. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also\nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding sensitive\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a concern is raised by significant unpaid\ndebts. Applicant has a history of financial problems. She has delinquent consumer debts, unpaid\njudgments, and delinquent student loans. Viewing the record evidence as a whole, the following\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline F apply: (1) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\nand (2) a history of not meeting financial obligations. To sum up, the record evidence shows a\npattern of financial problems.  \nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. She has\nnot presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations concern. In particular, the\nrecord evidence is insufficient to establish that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise\nresolve her indebtedness. Although she has made progress with her student loans, the loans are not\nyet current through the loan-rehabilitation program. In addition, I reach this conclusion because\nApplicant has not (except for the student loans) documented the actions, if any, she has taken to\naddress her financial problems. The lack of documentation makes it difficult to reach a favorable\ndecision. \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\u2014which includes delinquent student\nloans\u2014militates against granting her eligibility for an ADP position. Accordingly, I conclude that\nApplicant failed to establish it is in the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for an\nADP I, II, or III position. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the\nwhole-person concept and my whole-person analysis does not support a favorable outcome for\nApplicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR Paragraph 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013r :\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I, II, or III position.\nEligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard\n\n5\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nChristopher M. Benjamin, Esq.\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 14, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 26(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\n1\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation;\u201d\nApplicant ascribes error to the Judge for failure to discuss Mitigating Condition \u00b6 26(c ) (\u201cabuse of prescription\n2\ndrugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended;).\nThere is no indication in the record that that Mitigating Condition could reasonably apply.\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested  to have her case decided on the written record.  On July\n30, 2007, after reviewing the record, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant used marijuana as a college student between 1997 and 2001, stopping for the first\ntime upon graduation.  In 2002, Applicant applied for and was granted a security clearance.  At the\nsame time, Applicant professed an intent not to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in the future and\nsubmitted a signed, sworn statement to that effect.  Applicant received a security clearance in 2003.\nWhile holding the clearance, she continued to use marijuana occasionally, until January 2005.\nApplicant filled out a new security clearance application in September 2005 in order to upgrade her\nclearance.  At that time, Applicant admitted her continued use of marijuana after her submission of\nthe signed, sworn statement.  She again professes her intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor with regard to Guideline E; that finding is not in issue\nhere.  A prima facie case was established with regard to Guideline H, and the burden of proof then\nshifted to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised.  Applicant maintains that she met her\nburden of proof and that the Judge therefore committed error by denying her clearance.   The Judge\nproperly concluded that two Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions might apply in Applicant\u2019s\ncase  and then reasonably explained why neither applied under the circumstances of the case.\n1\nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions as to mitigation.  However, the application\nof disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-05439\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 29, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  \n2\n\n3\nWith specific reference to Applicant\u2019s promise not to use illegal drugs in the future, the\nfederal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted\naccess to classified information.  Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n. 6 (1980).  Security\nrequirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367\nU.S. 886 (1961).  In this case, the Judge explained why she gave limited weight to Applicant\u2019s\npromise, in light of a prior promise to the same effect which Applicant did not honor.\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not give adequate consideration to a whole-person\nanalysis.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.  In her decision, the Judge\ndiscussed the whole-person factors in the Directive \u00b6 6.3 and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n\u00b6 2(a).  Reading the case as a whole, the Board concludes the Judge evaluated the facts and\ncircumstances in terms of the whole-person concept, weighing both the favorable and unfavorable\nevidence, and articulated reasons for the unfavorable conclusions she reached under Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24988 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2005).  Here again,\nthe fact that Applicant weighs the evidence differently and reaches different conclusions from it is\nnot indicative of error by the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-33312 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2005).\nThe fact that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision will have a negative impact on Applicant is not\na basis for overruling the decision.  Likewise, the fact that, in Applicant\u2019s opinion, an adverse\nsecurity decision will have a harmful impact on the national defense is not relevant to whether the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08107 at\n4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2005).\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.      \nSigned: Jean E. Smallin       \nJean E.

She has not met her burden to mitigate the concerns raised under drug\ninvolvement. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nOn January 4, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to have\nher case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on May 31, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on June 4, 2007,\nand received on June 7, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

This was the first time she\napplied for a security clearance.  In response to question 27, Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug\nActivity - Illegal Use of Drugs, she answered, \"yes\" and indicated that she had used marijuana\napproximately 25 times between August 30, 1997, and May 15, 2001.   On June 14, 2002, she was\n7\ninterviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service in conjunction with her background\ninvestigation.  She provided a signed, sworn statement.  In the statement, she discussed her\nmarijuana use and stated:\nI stopped using marijuana in May 01 after graduation from college. I stopped because\nI matured, I was going out into the real world and I needed a real job. I have\nabsolutely no intentions of using marijuana or any other illegal or illicit drug or\nsubstance in the future.   \n8\nAppellant was granted a security clearance in June 2003. On September 28, 2005, she\nsubmitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) in order to upgrade her\nsecurity clearance.  In response to question 24(a), \"Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity,\nSince the age of 16 or the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine,\ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.),\nhallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\"she answered \"yes\" and indicated that she\nused marijuana approximately 30 times between August 1997 and May 2004.  She wrote in the\n9\nadditional comments section:\nAs I discussed with the agent who interviewed me for my Secret security clearance,\nthe extent of my marijuana use in college was approximately 5-6 times a year, only\nwhen drinking/partying. I never personally purchased any, but I contributed to the\npurchase with a group of friends, one of whom would go and make the purchase.\nSince graduating from college, I have used marijuana sporadically as made available\nby acquaintances in graduate school during parties.  I have not used marijuana since\nthe beginning of 2005.  This can be proven because of drug testing in my current\nplace of employment.10\n\n Item 4. \n11\n Response to FORM, dated July 2, 2007. \n12\n Department of the Navy v.

She is also willing to complete a prescribed\ndrug treatment program.  She no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs. She states that\nshe will never use marijuana again. She is willing to submit to voluntary urine tests.  She states that\nat the time of her sworn statement in June 2002,  she discontinued marijuana use and had no\nintention of using marijuana again. She made the mistake of using the marijuana again and fully\nadmitted her mistake on her request for a security clearance upgrade.11\nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant provided the results of two drug tests which she took\non June 8, 2007, and June 27, 2007. Both tested negative. She states that she has maintained a high\nlevel of trust with her co-workers and employers in all three jobs where she has held a security\nclearance. She follows  the rules for protecting classified information. She would never do anything\nto harm this country.  \n12\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive and the revised AGs, effective September 1, 2006.  The revised AGs set\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement:  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.14\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.15\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2.\n16\n Id.\n17\n Id.\n18\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Directive \u00b6 E.2.2.2; Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n16\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n17\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n18\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n19\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.20\n\u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n21\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\n\n AG, \u00b6 24(b).\n22\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nApplicant's past drug abuse raises a security concern. Drug abuse is defined as \"the illegal use\nof a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\"  Between\n22\nAugust 1997 and January 2005, Applicant used marijuana on a sporadic basis. The drug involvement\nsecurity concern is heightened further by her decision to use marijuana after being granted a security\nclearance, after stating during her security background investigation in June 2002 that she had no\nintent to use marijuana in the future. \nThe following Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) apply to Applicant's case.\nDI DC \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) applies due to her past history of illegal marijuana use. DI DC \u00b6 25(c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) applies.  Applicant possessed and purchased\nmarijuana on several occasions during college and graduate school.  \nDI DC \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance) applies.\nApplicant admits to using marijuana on several occasions while holding a security clearance.  Having\nbeen interviewed in depth about her marijuana use during her initial background investigation, she\nshould have been aware that any illegal drug use is a security concern.  In fact, she expressly stated\nin a June 14, 2002 signed, sworn, statement that she had no intentions of using marijuana in the future\nbut used marijuana on several occasions after being granted a security clearance. \nDI DC \u00b6 25(h) (expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use) applies.  Despite Applicant's expressed intentions to\nnever use illegal drugs after graduating from college, she used marijuana on several occasions up until\nJanuary 2005.  Her current intentions to never use marijuana again is less convincing based upon her\nreturn to illegal marijuana use in the past after making a similar claim. Her decision to use marijuana\nafter expressing her intentions to refrain from marijuana use is a failure to clearly and convincingly\ncommit to discontinue drug use.   \n \nThe drug involvement concern can be mitigated. However, I find none of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  In Applicant's case, two of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC)\nhave the potential to apply.  DI MC \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant's drug\nuse was recent. Her decision to use marijuana after telling the Defense Security Service that she has\nno intentions for future use raises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgement.\n\n7\nDI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation) is not applicable. Applicant said that she had no\nintent to use marijuana during her initial security background investigation.  She was granted a\nsecurity clearance.  It is likely the security clearance was granted based on her statement of intent to\nrefrain from illegal drugs in the future.  She continued using marijuana despite these intentions and\nafter being granted a security clearance.  She has already been granted one opportunity to demonstrate\nan intent to refrain from marijuana use.  She did not succeed.  Her current expressed intentions to\nrefrain from marijuana use carries less weight considering her failure to live up to her expressed\nintentions in the past.  \nAlthough Applicant indicated that she does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future, there\nis doubt that she will follow through on her intentions based on her failure to follow her past\nintentions to stop using marijuana. She has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug\ninvolvement security concern.  I find against Applicant under Guideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhile Applicant's case raises the overall concern under Guideline E, no specific disqualifying\ncondition applies to Applicant's case.  The government states Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, considered\nas a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information) applies.\nThis case is really a drug involvement case. The same conduct alleged under Guideline H is being\ncross alleged under Guideline E.  An adverse determination was made under Guideline H. As a result,\nPC DC \u00b6 16(c) does not apply based on the plain language of the disqualifying condition because the\ncredible adverse information was sufficient for an adverse determination under another guideline -\nGuideline H.\nThere are no allegations of deliberate falsification in this case. As such, cross alleging the\nconduct alleged under the drug involvement guideline under the personal conduct guideline is\nredundant. I find for Applicant with respect to Guideline E. \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. While Applicant\nclaims that she no longer intends to use marijuana, her continued use of marijuana after making a\n\n8\nsimilar statement in the past lessens the credibility of this statement.  Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by the drug involvement concern. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality\nof the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nGuideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2\nGuideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The Applicant Facility\nSecurity Officer (FSO) also recommends that the Applicant \u201cregain his clearance.\u201d  Mitigation is\nshown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 3, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 29, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued that same date, and the case was heard on April 25, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence, and called one witness to testify on his behalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on May\n4, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Alcohol Consumption militates\nagainst the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of\nall of the allegations; but denies excessive alcohol consumption subsequent to his last DUI, and\nadmits to receiving only 96 hours of community service as a result of that last DUI.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 27 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\n1.a.  Prior to his last arrest for DUI in October of 2004, the Applicant consumed alcohol on\n\u201cfour to five nights a week, five to six beers on an outing, if not more\u201d (TR at page 36 lines 10~18).\nSubsequent to this last arrest, the Applicant attended a \u201cDUI Program,\u201d and now consumes alcohol\n\u201conce a week, two beers on an outing\u201d (TR at page 37 lines 8~11).  He may have consumed \u201cthree\n\n3\nbeers on an outing since \u2013 since 2004,\u201d but he has not consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication\n(TR at page 37 lines 12~22).\n1.b.  In October of 2004, the Applicant was arrested, and subsequently charged, in part, with\nDUI (Government Exhibit (GX) 2).  He pled no contest to the charge; and as part of his sentence,\nhe performed 96 hours of community service, and attended a DUI Program (Id, and TR at page 30\nline 20 to page 31 line 14).\n\n4\n1.c.  In November of 2003, the Applicant was arrested, and subsequently charged, in part,\nwith DUI (GX 2).  He pled no contest to the charge; and as part of his sentence, he was fined $1,700,\nand attended a DUI Program (Id, and TR at page 31 line 15 to page 33 line 25).\nIn April of 2007, the Applicant was evaluated by a Clinical Psychologist (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AppX) M).  That Clinical Psychologist avers, in part, the following:\nThe results of the psychological questionnaires utilized to provide more objective\ninformation regarding . . . [the Applicant\u2019s] substance abuse potential strongly\nsuggests his potential for substance dependency is relatively low.  Additionally,\nthe absence of any familial history of substance abuse reduces . . . [the Applicant\u2019s]\nrisk of addiction.  [The Applicant\u2019s] use of alcohol was likely supported by the\n\u201cpositive social interactions\u201d which he experienced when drinking, and he apparently\nis now aware of that co-occurrence.\n. . . The potential for his becoming a security risk on the basis of substance abuse or\ndependency is not viewed, on the basis of the information available, to be any greater\nthan that for any other person using alcohol appropriately and socially (Id,\nemphasis supplied).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in Enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\n\n5\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has\ndemonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that\nan applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted Alcohol Consumption is evidenced by two DUI\u2019s, one in\nNovember of 2003, and the last one in October of 2004.  The first disqualifying condition under\nAlcohol Consumption is therefore applicable he has had \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, . . . disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  The\nthird disqualifying condition is also applicable, as there was \u201cbinge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent.\u201d  However, these are countered the first and second mitigating conditions as\n\u201cso much time has passed [nearly three years] . . . that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and \u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his . . . issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of . . . responsible use.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, his former supervisor,\na retired Navy Captain, his FSO, and a colleague speak most highly of his character, credibility and\ntrustworthiness (TR at page 20 line 24 to page 28 line 5, and AppXs J and N).  The totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable\nDecision under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline G is found for the\nApplicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nAlcohol Consumption.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline G, and\n\n6\nof Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has  met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuideline G.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nc. For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision under Guideline K is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:  Applicant is 49, single and has a Bachelor\nof Science degree.  He has worked for his employer (Company) for 20 years.  Applicant has moved\nup the ranks, holding positions of increasing authority and responsibility.  He currently supervises\n90 people who have security clearances.  Applicant has favorable employment and character\nreferences.\nApplicant has had ten documented security violations between 1991 and 2006, and admitted\nall of the allegations in the SOR.   During the entire time the Applicant has been at the Company,\n1\nthere has been a rule which allows employees on a secure floor to have classified information out\nof the classified container until 5:30 p.m. during the work week. At that time, all classified material\nmust be returned to the container and secured for the night.  Applicant worked on the secure floor\nat all times relevant to the case.\nApplicant\u2019s first security violation occurred on March 22, 1991.  This violation was for\nleaving his classified container unsecured and unattended.  His second security violation occurred\non March 28, 1991.  This violation was also for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended.  This time it was unattended for over a day   The Security Administrator wrote at the\ntime, \u201c[Applicant] was obviously concerned that this was his second open container violation within\na one week period, and indicated that he would ensure that his container is properly secured in the\nfuture.\u201d  This report was sent to a person in the Company\u2019s senior leadership (Mr. A) and also to the\nDefense Investigative Service (DIS).  \nApplicant\u2019s third security violation occurred on October 10, 1991. This violation was for\nleaving his classified container unsecured and unattended for approximately 25 minutes. This report\nwas also sent to Mr. A and DIS.  Applicant\u2019s fourth security violation occurred on January 6, 1992.\nThis violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and unattended for approximately\n\n3\nsix hours.  This report was again sent to Mr. A and DIS.  As a result of this report, additional security\nprocedures were applied to Applicant\u2019s container. \nApplicant\u2019s fifth security violation occurred on January 13, 1993.  This violation was for\nleaving his classified container open, a Secret disk on his desk, and a Secret disk pack in his\ncomputer, all unsecured and unattended for two hours and 50 minutes.  There were 81 unsecured\nclassified items in his office at the time of this violation.  Mr. A was sent an email by the security\ndepartment concerning this security violation.  This e-mail indicates that the Applicant \u201cwas\nreminded of the seriousness of the situation with respect to repeated security violations.\u201d  Applicant\nwas also reminded by the security department of the requirements established after his last security\nviolation. Additionally, he was told that, despite the fact this was his fifth security violation in 22\nmonths, DIS would not be sent a report, but that \u201cany further breaches of security would have to be\nreported to the government with the resultant possibility of a formal investigation to determine his\neligibility for continued access to classified information.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s sixth security violation occurred on December 27, 1999.  This violation was for\nleaving his classified container unsecured and unattended.  Applicant stated that he did not have an\nend of day security procedure in place and that is why the violation occurred.  Applicant\u2019s seventh\nsecurity violation occurred on July 21, 2003.  This violation was for leaving his classified container\nunsecured and unattended for approximately 40 minutes.\nApplicant\u2019s eighth security violation occurred on December 3, 2003.  This violation was for\nleaving 16 pages of a classified rough draft unsecured and unattended for 45 minutes.  A report of\nthe incident was sent to the Defense Security Service.  Applicant\u2019s ninth security violation occurred\non October 12, 2005.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended for approximately five hours.  Applicant once again stated to the Company security\ndepartment that \u201che fully understands the importance of protecting classified information as well as\nthe rules and regulations put in place to protect that same information.\u201d His direct supervisor at that\ntime (Ms. B) was also notified of this violation.  \nApplicant\u2019s tenth security violation occurred on May 16, 2006.   This violation was for\nleaving his classified container unsecured and unattended.  Ms. B was notified of this violation.\nApplicant was again notified of his security responsibilities and, again, the Applicant indicated \u201cthat\nhe fully understands the importance of protecting classified information as well as the rules and\nregulations put in place to protect that information.\u201d\n(1) Applicant contends that the Judge did not adhere to the procedural requirements of\nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive because he did not conduct all proceedings in a \u201cfair,\ntimely, and orderly manner,\u201d and he did not issue his decision \u201cin a timely manner.\u201d  In support of\nthis contention he argues that the Judge \u201cinterrupted [Applicant\u2019s] testimony to deal with another\n\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 30.\n2\n See Transcript at 203.\n3\nThe record in this case is not troublesome.  In some cases, a Judge\u2019s manner of going off the record has\n4\nproduced transcripts that are difficult to follow or leave pertinent decisions undocumented.  It behooves the parties and\nthe Judge to ensure that a record is complete and intelligible.\nApplicant argues that he left classified material unattended and unsecured: (1) on March 28, 1991, for less than\n5\na day, not for over a day;  (2) on January 6, 1992, for 40 minutes, not for approximately six hours; (3) on January 13,\n1993, for 50 minutes, not for two hours and 50 minutes; (4) on July 21, 2003, for 11 minutes, not 40 minutes, (5) on\nDecember 3, 2003, for 33, not 45 minutes; and (6) on October 12, 2005, for 45 minutes, not approximately five hours.\nApplicant does not dispute the fact that he left classified material unattended and unsecured on any of the aforesaid dates.\n4\nmatter\u201d on one occasion, \u201cthereby interrupting his own ability to focus on [Applicant],\u201d and he took\nfour and a half months to issue his decision in the case.   \n2\nThe Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments in this regard persuasive.  The transcript\nshows only that the Judge went off the record for an unspecified period of time.  No reason was\ngiven for the recess, and no objection was made by Applicant\u2019s counsel at the time.   There is a\n3\nrebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties in good faith.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to rebut that\npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that heavy burden\nin that he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a\nreasonable person to conclude that the Judge acted improperly, unfairly or unprofessionally.  See,\ne.g, ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 2  (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jun. 6, 2006).   \n4\nThe Board has no supervisory authority over Hearing Office Judges and no basis to assume\nhow large an individual Judge\u2019s caseload may be.  In this case, there is no basis in the record to\nconclude that the Judge processed this case in way that would constitute error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-10880 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005)(where Applicant objected to the 141 day passage of\ntime between his hearing and the issuance of the Judge\u2019s decision).  Absent a showing that a delay\nin the processing of a case prejudiced an applicant\u2019s rights in a meaningful way, mere proof of a\ndelay is not sufficient to warrant remand or reversal of the Judge\u2019s decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 00-0030 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2001); DISCR Case No. 93-1186 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 1995).\n(2)  Applicant also argues that the Judge erred as to six of his findings about the length of\ntime Applicant had left classified containers unsecured and unattended,  and three of his\n5\n\nApplicant objects to the Judge\u2019s statement that the \u201csenior leadership\u201d at Applicant\u2019s company \u201ceffectively\n6\nwere undercutting the work of their own security staff by downplaying or ignoring the repeated violations of Applicant.\u201d\nHe also objects to the Judge\u2019s statements that Applicant \u201cknew the rules but felt he could ignore them,\u201d and that his\nrepeated violations were \u201cnot \u2018inadvertent,\u2019 but the result of a personal attitude.\u201d  Decision at 10.\n5\ncharacterizations based on the evidence as a whole.   Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard does not\n6\ndemonstrate harmful error.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences\nthat could be drawn from the record, and are, therefore, sustainable.   Applicant has not identified\nany harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.\n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law because the Judge failed to examine relevant  evidence and factors, failed to consider\nan important aspect of the case, and reached an overall decision that ran contrary to the record\nevidence.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  He is not\nrequired to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s decision is not measured against a standard of perfection.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-01009 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 2005).  A review of the record indicates that\nthe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness\nof the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  He found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E.  However, he reasonably explained why\n\n6\nthe evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S.\n29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly,\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline K is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On February 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines K and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\nAll references are to the November 7, 2007, transcript of the proceedings.\n1\n2\nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 12, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on June 13, 2007.  I received the case assignment on June 18,\n2007.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 16, 2007, and hearings were held on\nOctober 2, 2007, and November 7, 2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits\n1 through 13, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf, called four additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through P,\nwithout objection. The Pre-Hearing and Post-Hearing Briefs of the Applicant were\nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits Q and R for Identification only.  DOHA received the final\ntranscript of the hearing on November 19, 2007.  The record closed on that date. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 49, single and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Applicant has worked for his employer (Company) for 20 years.  He has\nsteadily moved up the ranks, holding positions of increasing authority and responsibility.\nThe Applicant currently works as Director of a Program.  This Program is part of a major\nProject of the Corporation.  He currently supervises 90 people who have security\nclearances.  (Transcript at 189.)  \n1\nThe record shows that the Applicant has had ten documented security violations\nbetween 1991 and 2006.  (SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.)  The Applicant\nadmitted all of the allegations in the SOR.  Those allegations so admitted are hereby\ndeemed findings of fact.  \nDuring the entire time the Applicant has been at the Company there has been a\nrule which allows employees on a secure floor to have classified information out of the\nclassified container until 5:30 pm during the work week.  At that time, all classified\nmaterial must be returned to the container and secured for the night.  The Applicant\nworked on the secure floor at all times relevant to this Decision.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K,\nTranscript at 171-172 .)\n\nThe Applicant testified that he had little to no independent recollection of the security violations designated\n2\nas SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.  (Transcript at 178-179.)\nThe Applicant testified that Mr. A was not his day to day supervisor. (Transcript at 169-170.)  Mr. A did receive\n3\nthe Performance Evaluations of the Applicant, and he forwarded the Department Performance Reviews of the\nApplicant to the Salary Committee of the Company, during the period encompassing SOR subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.e.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O at 57-137.)  Accordingly, I find that he had a degree of supervisory control\nover the Applicant at these times.\n3\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant\u2019s first security violation occurred on March 22,\n1991.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and unattended.\n(Government Exhibit 10.)2\n \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant\u2019s second security violation occurred on March\n28, 1991.  This violation was also for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended.  This time it was unattended for over a day.  The Security Administrator\nwrote at the time, \u201c[The Applicant] was obviously concerned that this was his second\nopen container violation within a one week period, and indicated that he would ensure\nthat his container is properly secured in the future.\u201d  This report was sent to a person in\nthe Company\u2019s senior leadership (Mr. A) and also to the Defense Investigative Service\n(DIS).  (Government Exhibit 10.)3\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s third security violation occurred on October\n10, 1991.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended for approximately 25 minutes.  This report was also sent to Mr. A and the\nDIS. (Government Exhibit 11.)\nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s fourth security violation occurred on January\n6, 1992.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended for approximately six hours.  This report was also sent to Mr. A and the DIS.\n(Government Exhibit 12.)\nThis report states as follows:\nAfter discussing this violation with the Director of Security, [the\nApplicant\u2019s] Corporate Research Manager and Administrative Services\nManager, the following additional security procedures are to be applied to\n[the Applicant\u2019s] classified container usage. [The Applicant] will 1) secure\nall classified material and his container each time he leaves his office for\nany reason and 2), display a \u201cSecurity Container Check Sheet\u201d on his\ncontainer at all times, which he must initial and annotate with the date and\ntime of each opening and closing of the container. [The Applicant\u2019s]\ncontainer will also be checked at the end of each day by a department\nsecretary or by Security appointed personnel who will initial the \u201cSecurity\nContainer Check Sheet\u201d and annotate the date and time that it was\nchecked.  If [the Applicant] leaves after the evening check, he will contact\nthe Sergeant on duty who will check [the Applicant\u2019s] container prior to\n[the Applicant\u2019s] departure. [The Applicant] was obviously concerned\n\nSee, Applicant\u2019s sworn statement of March 13, 1992, for a further discussion of his first four security\n4\nviolations.  (Government Exhibit 3.)\n4\nabout this violation and indicated he will ensure in the future that his\ncontainer is properly secured.4\nThe Applicant admits that he did not follow all of these requirements strictly, if at\nall.  He stated that he wanted to take care of the problem himself and that he did not\nwant to impose on others because he was working long hours at that time.  (Transcript\nat 196-198.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant\u2019s fifth security violation occurred on January\n13, 1993.  This violation was for leaving his classified container open, a Secret disk on\nhis desk, and a Secret diskpack in his computer, all unsecured and unattended for two\nhours and 50 minutes.  There were 81 unsecured classified items in his office at the\ntime of this violation.  \nMr. A was sent an email by the Security Department concerning this security\nviolation.  This email indicates that the Applicant \u201cwas reminded of the seriousness of\nthe situation with respect to repeated security violations.\u201d  The Applicant was also\nreminded by the security department of the requirements established after his last\nsecurity violation.  He was also told that, despite the fact this was his fifth security\nviolation in 22 months, DIS would not be sent a report. He was also told that \u201cany further\nbreaches of security would have to be reported to the government with the resultant\npossibility of a formal investigation to determine his eligibility for continued access to\nclassified information.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 13.)\nThe Applicant went several years without a reported security violation.  From late\n1998 to December 1999, the Applicant worked for the Company in a foreign country.\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant\u2019s sixth security violation occurred on December\n27, 1999.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended.  (Government Exhibit 2 at page 1.)  The Applicant testified that this violation\noccurred the first day he returned to work after a year in a foreign country.  He further\nstated that he did not have an end of day security procedure in place and that is why the\nviolation occurred.  (Transcript at 174-175.)\nThe Applicant was interviewed by the DIS on January 16, 2002.  This interview\nmentions all six of the Applicant\u2019s security violations as of that date.  The Applicant said,\n\u201cI am very careful about handling classified information, and . . . I do not see any\nproblem with me safeguarding classified information in the future.\u201d  (Government Exhibit\n2 at 1.)\nSubparagraph 1.g.  The Applicant\u2019s seventh security violation occurred on July\n21, 2003.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended for approximately 40 minutes.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  The Applicant\n\nThe Defense Security Service is the successor agency to the Defense Investigative Service.\n5\n5\ntestified that, during this period, his parents\u2019 health was declining and he occasionally\nhad to rush out of the office to assist his parents.  (Transcript at 175-176.)\nSubparagraph 1.h.  The Applicant\u2019s eighth security violation occurred on\nDecember 3, 2003.  This violation was for leaving 16 pages of a classified rough draft\nunsecured and unattended for 45 minutes.  This report was sent to the Defense\nSecurity Service (DSS)  (Government Exhibit 7.)   The Applicant stated that this\n5\nparticular event happened because his mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s\nDisease, had attacked her care giver with a knife and he had to rush to his parents\u2019\nhome.  (Transcript at 175-176.)\nSubparagraph 1.i.  The Applicant\u2019s ninth security violation occurred on October\n12, 2005.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and\nunattended for approximately five hours.  The Applicant once again stated to the\nCompany security department that \u201che fully understands the importance of protecting\nclassified information as well as the rules and regulations put in place to protect that\nsame information.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 5.)   The Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor at that\ntime (Ms. B) was also notified of this violation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 3.)\nSubparagraph 1.j.  The Applicant\u2019s tenth security violation occurred on May 16,\n2006.  This violation was for leaving his classified container unsecured and unattended. \nMs. B was notified of this violation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 3-4.)  The Applicant was\nagain notified of his security responsibilities and, again, the Applicant indicated \u201cthat he\nfully understands the importance of protecting classified information as well as the rules\nand regulations put in place to protect that information.\u201d  In addition, once again,\narrangements were to be made to have the Applicant\u2019s assistant or other colleague\ndouble check his container each evening to make sure it was locked.  Finally, the\nCompany Facility Security Officer met with the Applicant and Ms. B \u201cto further reinforce\nhis need for increased diligence regarding the protection of classified information.\u201d\n(Government Exhibit 4.)\nThe Applicant received the SOR on or about February 13, 2007.  At that time, in\norder to avoid any further security violations, he had all the classified material removed\nfrom his office and placed in an Open Storage Facility (OSF) within the Company\u2019s\nheadquarters.  In this OSF the Applicant can have unfettered access to classified\ninformation without having to worry about his securing the material at the end of the\nwork day.  The material is actually in the custody of other people and the entire OSF is\nthe equivalent of a classified container.  (Transcript at 182-183, 212-213.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant made several arguments about why the number of his security\nviolations does not mean he has a lax attitude about security.  First, he argues that he\ndid not properly understand the importance of all of the security requirements, but now\nhe does.  He testified that he expected there to be a step by step violation process.  He\n\nSee also Transcript at 83.\n6\nSee also the Applicant\u2019s testimony at 183-184, and that of Mr. E at 228-229,  for support of this attitude.\n7\n6\nfully expected there to be oral warnings or other Company sanctions before his security\nclearance became endangered. He further, incorrectly, understood that after a certain\namount of time his violations would no longer count.  The Applicant indicated that he\nbelieved the cumulative number of his security violations would not have an impact on\nhis security worthiness.  (Transcript at 205-207.)   The Applicant further testified that not\n6\nuntil 2006 did he believe that he was in trouble.  Even then, it was not until he received\nthe SOR that he realized the seriousness of the situation.  (Transcript at 179-180.)\nSecond, the Applicant and his witnesses argued that the Company\u2019s earlier\nattitude towards this type of security violation was not as strict as it could be.  The\nExecutive Vice President of the Company testified (Mr. C).  He discussed how the\nCompany used to view each security violation discretely, not recognizing troubling\npatterns like the Applicant\u2019s.  He further stated that the Company has hired a new\nDirector of Security, who is tasked with correcting the problems the Applicant\u2019s case has\nuncovered.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, Transcript at 57-61.)  \nThe new Company Director of Security (Mr. D) provided in-depth testimony, in\naddition to a written statement (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N), about how he believes the\ncorporate security environment at the Company has changed because of the\nApplicant\u2019s case.  He particularly believed that much of what happened with the\nApplicant occurred because security violations were not seen as a performance issue\nwith the Applicant, in that his rating was not effected by his security violations.  The\npolicies were clear cut, but the follow-up by management was not always there.  He\nbelieves that attitude has now changed.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit P; Transcript at 86-95,\n101-103, 135-138.)  He further testified that the Company was somewhat inconsistent in\ntheir reporting to DIS and DSS of the Applicant\u2019s security violations.  (Transcript at 153-\n154.)\nMs. B, the Project Vice President and Applicant\u2019s second level supervisor from\n1997 until 2006, provided a written statement.  In that statement she says:\nI believed, based on my training and observations at [the Company]\nthat failing to properly spin the dial on a safe in a secure and access-\ncontrolled facility was, in the scheme of things, a relatively minor, but not\nunimportant, issue which would only be reported to DSS in the event there\nwas some kind of \u201ctrip wire\u201d that would trigger such reporting.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F at 3.)7\nThe Applicant\u2019s first line supervisor from 2003 to 2006 (Mr. E) provided a written\nstatement (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G) and testified.  In broad terms his testimony\ncorresponded with that of the other witnesses.  In particular, he describes the difference\nin attitude between security violations on the cleared floor and those in open areas.\n\nSee also Applicant\u2019s curriculum vitae, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.\n8\nSee also Applicant\u2019s Exhibits J and M.\n9\n7\n(Transcript at 240-242.)  He also discussed occasions where the Applicant would\nclosely follow onerous security regulations.  (Transcript at 230-232.)\nThe current Vice President of the Project (Mr. F) also provided a written\nstatement (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H) and testified.  He also believed that the seriousness of\nthe situation was not properly brought to the attention of the Applicant, and that had a\nserious impact on the Applicant\u2019s actions.  (Transcript at 259-260, 282-283.)\nThird, the Applicant and his witnesses made much of the fact that the Applicant\u2019s\nviolations occurred in his office, which is on a cleared floor with restricted access.  In\nother words, the possibility of any classified material being compromised was very\nslight.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K.)\nIn addition to evidence concerning mitigation of the Applicant\u2019s security\nviolations, there was considerable testimony and evidence about the Applicant\u2019s general\ngood character and importance to the defense industry.   His performance evaluations\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O) show an individual of intelligence and talent moving up the\ncorporate ladder.   He provided a letter of support from a senior uniformed leader of one\n8\nof the Armed Forces (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  \nThe senior leadership of the Company provided laudatory written statements\nand/or testimony concerning the Applicant.  Mr. C testified about the Applicant\u2019s\nreceiving a President\u2019s Award at the Company and his general importance to the\nCompany.  (Transcript at 42-47.)  Mr. E finds the Applicant to be \u201cone of the most\ntrustworthy and steady . . . steadfast people that I\u2019ve worked with at [the Company].\u201d\n(Transcript at 224-225.)  Mr. F testified that the Applicant is the person he turns to when\nhis Project needs quick, reliable answers.  (Transcript at 258.)9\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n8\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information\nis set out in AG & 33:      \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations\nfor protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about\n\n9\nan individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and\nability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe Applicant has ten security violations over a period of 17 years, the first being\nin 1991 and the last being in 2006.  I find that the following disqualifying conditions apply\nto this case under Guideline K: 34.(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection\nof classified or other sensitive information and 34.(h) negligence or lax security habits\nthat persist despite counseling by management.\nThere are two mitigating conditions that arguably apply to the Applicant\u2019s conduct\nunder Guideline K.  They are 35.(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or\nremedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the\ndischarge of security responsibilities and 35.(c) the security violations were due to\nimproper or inadequate training.\nConcerning cases such as this, the DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cA person\nwho has committed security violations has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that\nthey should be entrusted with classified information. Because security violations strike\nat the heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any\nclaims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 00-0030 (Appeal\nBoard, September 20, 2001).)  In the same case, the Appeal Board further says that the\nGovernment has a compelling interest in protecting classified information from\ndisclosure to unauthorized persons, regardless of whether the disclosure is the result of\ndeliberate or negligent conduct\nThis same history of security violations arguably brings into play disqualifying\ncondition 16.(d) under Guideline E: credible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of\ndishonesty or rule violations.\nThe following mitigating condition under Guideline E arguably applies to his\nconduct: 17.(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\n\nFor purposes of this Decision, I am viewing the term \u201coffense\u201d as including the security violations of the\n10\nApplicant.  No criminal or dishonest conduct is implied to the Applicant in the use of this term.\n10\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.10\nStripped to its essence, the Applicant\u2019s argument, supported by the management\nof the Company, is that it is primarily the Company\u2019s fault that the Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance is in jeopardy.  The theory is that, even though the security system worked, in\nthe main, as it was supposed to, the Applicant did not completely understand how\nimportant it is to follow every security rule.  The evidence is clear that the Applicant\nknew the rules but felt he could ignore them because, in his opinion, the possibility of\nimproper release of classified information was low.  That decision was not his to make.\nThe line between corporate and individual responsibility in a case such as this is\nblurry at best.  However, there comes a point when an individual must be held\nresponsible for his actions.  The fact is the Applicant\u2019s ten security violations were not\n\u201cinadvertent,\u201d but the result of a personal attitude, which he admits having, that \u201cpeople\ndidn\u2019t take the spinning the dial thing seriously.\u201d  (Transcript at 183.)  That attitude, and\nexcuse, may work for the first one or two security violations, but the record shows ten\nviolations. Security personnel talked to the Applicant and, almost every time, he was\ndescribed as being contrite, remorseful, concerned and repeatedly stated that he knew\nhis security responsibilities and would fulfill them.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L at 1.)  Yet,\nevery time, he committed another violation.\nIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to say that the Applicant has responded\nfavorably to counseling or remedial security training when, by his own admission, it took\nreceipt of the SOR to get the point across.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot\nfind that mitigating condition 35.(b) applies.\nCertainly, the attitude of the senior leadership of the Company towards security\nbefore the hiring of the new Director of Security is troubling.  By their attitude, they\neffectively were undercutting the work of their own security staff by downplaying or\nignoring the repeated security violations of the Applicant.  However, the security staff\ndid their job by repeatedly reminding him of his responsibilities and, on at least two\noccasions, changing the procedures the Applicant was to follow.  In addition, there is\nevidence that the Applicant knew security rules well and could be strict in applying their\noften onerous requirements when he felt like it. Once again, corporate culpability can\nonly go so far.  Based on the state of the record, I do not find that his security violations\nwere the result of improper or inadequate training as set forth in mitigating condition\n35.(c).\n The Applicant states that he has changed his attitude about security and\nviolations like this will never happen again.  Part of the reason is that he has had his\nsecurity containers removed from his office and put into an OSF.  This action handles a\nsymptom of the problem, but not the underlying cause.  The underlying cause, as I have\ndiscussed above, is his attitude of almost 20 years that he knows best when it comes to\n\n11\nwhich security rules he will follow.  I must be convinced that the Applicant has truly\nchanged his ways and will show good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness with\nregards to all of his security responsibilities in the future.  I am not so convinced.  I find\nagainst the Applicant with regards to Guideline K.  He is not currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\nTurning next to Paragraph 2.  As stated above, I find that the Applicant\u2019s conduct\nis cognizable under Guideline K.  Given that finding, Guideline E as alleged does not\napply to the facts of this case.  Accordingly, that Guideline is found for the Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, and valuable member of the defense industry.  I have carefully\nconsidered all the potential mitigating evidence in this case, including the laudatory\npersonal opinions of his superiors at the Company and in the Armed Forces.  \nThe Applicant, over a period of years, repeatedly violated security rules which the\nvast majority of the people with security clearances obey without thought.  His conduct\nwas very serious.  The argument that his violations are somehow lessened because,\nassuming everyone else did their jobs, there was no possibility of compromise is\nrejected.  His conduct was recent and frequent, the last violation of the ten being in\n2006.  Based on the current state of the record, I cannot find that there is the presence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes.  Finally, even though he no\nlonger has classified information in his office, I cannot find that there is no likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history\nof security violations.  \n\n12\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\nstated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On December 14,\n2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Answer at 1-2 (Government Exhibit 3).\n2\nDecision at 3.\n3\nId at 3, n. 4; Government Exhibit 4.\n4\n2\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be\ndecided on the written record.  On May 22, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nDavid M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Board can consider new evidence\non appeal.\nIn this case, SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b alleged trustworthiness concerns based on the fact\nthat Applicant\u2019s mother, father, brother, and sister-in-law were citizens and residents of China.1\nSOR paragraph 1.c alleged trustworthiness concerns based on the fact that Applicant had traveled\nto China in 2003.  Applicant admitted without explanation to all three allegations.   \n2\nIn his decision, the Judge found that Applicant had \u201c. . . reported and admitted that she\ntraveled to China for pleasure from August 16, 2003 to September 7, 2004\u201d\u2014a period of over a\nyear.   The Judge based this finding on the dates provided by the Applicant in her Public Trust\n3\nPosition Application (SF-85P).   On appeal, Applicant states that she mistakenly typed the wrong\n4\ndate on her application\u20142004 instead of 2003.  In reality, she had only traveled to China from\nAugust 16, 2003 to September 7, 2003, a period of less than a month.  In support of her statement,\nshe attaches a copy of her Chinese Passport, showing the relevant entry and exit stamps.  Applicant\nalso states that her parents \u201c. . . just immigrated to the US and received their green cards.\u201d  Both\nApplicant\u2019s statements and her attachment are new evidence which was not considered by the Judge\nbelow.  Applicant requests that the Board set aside the Judge\u2019s adverse decision, based on this new\nevidence.  However, her appeal brief articulates no legal basis in support of that request. \n      \nApplicant elected to have her case decided on the written record, and then declined to file a\nresponse to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).  Her request for relief as to the\nmistaken travel dates is not based on newly discovered evidence, unavailable to her prior to the\nJudge\u2019s decision.  Rather, it is based on evidence which was in her custody and control during the\nentire pendency of her case.  While that evidence bears directly on the trustworthiness concern\nalleged in SOR paragraph 1.c, it would not substantially mitigate the trustworthiness concerns set\nforth in SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b.  Moreover, a review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that he\nquestioned the accuracy of the dates at issue, suggesting that Applicant\u2019s trip to China may actually\nhave been of shorter duration: \u201cThe information concerning the dates of her travel to China, provided\nby Applicant in Gov X 4, may be in error.  It appears inconsistent that she could have become a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in June 2004 if she was traveling in China from August 2003 through\n\nDecision at 3, n. 9.  The Judge then went on to note that Applicant had provided no clarifying or corrective\n5\ninformation in response to either the SOR or the FORM.\n3\nSeptember 2004.\u201d5\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party\nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases de novo.  The Board may\nnot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its submission does not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-08653 at 3 (App. Bd. May\n14, 2007).  Accordingly, the Board cannot grant Applicant the relief she requests.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a government contractor seeking a position of public\ntrust. She was born in China and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2004. Her mother, father,\nbrother and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of China. She submitted no evidence in\n\nUndersecretary of Defense Memorandum, Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\n1\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005), Aug. 30, 2006, directed implementation and use\nof the revised adjudicative guidelines for all security clearance adjudications and other determinations made under the\nDirective in which an SOR had not been issued by Sept. 1, 2006. Para. 6.1 of DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, Jan. 1987, as amended, and Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security)\nMemorandum, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, Nov. 19, 2004, direct that trustworthiness determinations be\nadjudicated utilizing the provisions of the Directive.\nGov X 3 (Applicant\u2019s response copy of  SOR dated Jan. 26, 2007).\n2\nThe government submitted four items in support of the allegations, and seven source documents in support of\n3\na request to take administrative notice of material facts concerning China.\n2\nextenuation or mitigation of foreign influence security concerns raised by these family connections.\nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to sensitive\ninformation, in an automated data processing (ADP) position designated ADP-I/II/III, to Applicant.\nEligibility to occupy such a public trust position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a public trust position on September 28, 2004, in conjunction with her\nemployment by a defense contractor in an automated data processing (ADP) position designated\nADP-I/II/III. On December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding, under the Directive and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines,  that it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility\n1\nfor an ADP-I/II/III-designated position, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether eligibility for a public trust position should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations by returning an annotated and notarized copy,\ndated January 26, 2007, admitting the truth of all of the allegations, and electing to have her case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant did not submit any matters for\n2\nconsideration in extenuation or mitigation of her admissions. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on February 27, 2007. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and she was\n3\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM on\nMarch 9, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. She did not submit any further response to the FORM by\nthe April 9, 2007 due date, nor did she request an extension of time to respond. The case was\nassigned to me on May 2, 2007.\n\nGov X 4 (Public Trust Position Application (SF-85P), dated Sep. 28, 2004) at 1, 4.\n4\nId. at 1, 2, 3.\n5\nId. at 3, 8.\n6\nId. at 4; Gov X 3, supra n. 2, at 2.\n7\nGov X 4, supra n. 4, at 1.\n8\nThe information concerning the dates of her travel to China, provided by Applicant in Gov X 4, may be in\n9\nerror.  It appears inconsistent that she could have become a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2004 if she was traveling in\nChina from August 2003 through September 2004. However, she provided no clarifying or corrective information in\nresponse to the SOR or FORM. \nDepartment Counsel listed and identified the seven source documents on pages 6 and 7 of the FORM. They\n10\nare attached behind Gov X 4.\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of every factual allegation set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nforeign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c). Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain eligibility for\na public trust position for the first time.  She was born in China, has lived in the United States since\n4\nat least 1995, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States on June 16, 2004.  Applicant\n5\nreported on her public trust position application, and admitted in response to the SOR, that her\nfather, her mother, her brother and her sister-in-law are citizens and residents of China.  Her husband\nwas also born in China, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Applicant further reported and admitted\n6\nthat she traveled to China for pleasure from August 16, 2003 to September 7, 2004.  She stated that\n7\nshe has never held a U.S. passport and denied that she was ever a dual citizen of the U.S. and another\ncountry.  Her lack of a U.S. passport and the length of her stay in China indicate that she must have\n8\ntraveled on a Chinese passport, especially since she did not become a U.S. citizen until June 2004.9\nDepartment Counsel sought administrative notice of the material facts concerning China set\nforth in part III of the FORM, and provided seven official U.S. Government source documents\nsupporting the truth of those facts.  Applicant did not object to this request, and I did take\n10\nadministrative notice of those facts in reaching my decision in this case. Among the most pertinent\nof these facts are that China has an authoritarian communist government with a poor human rights\nrecord that, despite improving economic relations, remains a rival military and political power to the\nUnited States. China has targeted the U.S. with active intelligence gathering programs, and is one\nof the most aggressive countries in targeting sensitive and protected U.S. technologies. The large\nnumber of Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China. Those traveling to, and living in China are subject to surveillance, monitoring\nand search by Chinese authorities without their consent or knowledge.\nPOLICIES            \n\nSee supra, n. 1.\n11\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\n12\nInformation, dated August 2006 \u00b6 2.\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n13\n4\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability and trustworthiness determinations, including those involving\nADP I, II, and III positions.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\n11\nadjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual's eligibility for a position of public trust. The adjudicative guideline relevant to\nApplicant\u2019s case is Guideline B: Foreign Influence. Potentially applicable DCs and MCs under this\nguideline are discussed in detail below, in connection with my conclusions. \nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n12\ndecisions. The entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nAll available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative Process\nfactors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the applicable guidelines, are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a trustworthiness\ndetermination must be clearly consistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to\nwhether access to sensitive information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved\nin favor of the national security.   \n13\nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and\nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n14\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n17\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by substantial evidence.  The\n14\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to sensitive ADP-I/II/III information. \u201cDepartment Counsel\nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n15\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\n[clearance] decision.\u201d  Once the government has met its initial burden of production, the burden of\n16\npersuasion (including any burden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government,\nbut remains with Applicant.  \n17\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information in a position of public trust seeks to enter\na fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship\nthat transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this\nspecial relationship that the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence\nin those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive information. Decisions under this Directive\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information or ADP systems. Such decisions entail\na certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of sensitive information.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)            \n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 6.\n18\n6\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d18\nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, brother and sister-in-law are all citizens and residents of China,\nand she reported that she traveled there to visit them from August 2003 to September 2004. These\ncircumstances raise security concerns under foreign influence disqualifying condition (FI DC) 7(a)\n(\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d). China is active in the collection of\nprotected information, including from U.S. citizens, so her temporary and their permanent presence\nthere creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion. FI DC 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing this\ninformation\u201d) also potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s Chinese connections. There need not be\nevidence of an actual conflict of interest to raise security concerns, the potential conflict, arising from\nApplicant\u2019s numerous and close ties to Chinese citizens and residents, is sufficient to shift the burden\nto her to disprove its existence or otherwise mitigate the concerns. Finally, her extended visit to\nChina raises security concerns under FI DC 7(i) (\u201cconduct, especially when traveling outside the\nU.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country\u201d) based on China\u2019s documented practice of surveillance and\nmonitoring of visitors.\nApplicant has neither asserted that any foreign influence mitigating condition (FI MC)\napplies to her circumstances, nor is there any evidence in the record that would support the\napplication of any FI MC.  I have reviewed each potential FI MC and conclude that, on this record,\nnone apply. \nWhole Person Analysis           \nExcept for her husband, Applicant\u2019s entire immediate family are citizens and residents of\nChina. Applicant submitted neither evidence nor other information from which any mitigating\ncondition or circumstance might be applied to lessen the security concerns raised by the potential\nfor conflict of interest, coercion, pressure, duress or manipulation created by her foreign connections.\nThese foreign connections will continue into the foreseeable future. Applicant is a mature and\neducated individual who failed to alleviate security concerns in the face of her burden to do so.\nGiven China\u2019s reportedly active collection of protected information, this burden is significant, and\nApplicant failed to overcome it. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her access to sensitive\ninformation or eligibility for a public trust position.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n\n7\nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue access to sensitive information, in an automated data\nprocessing (ADP) position designated ADP-I/II/III, to Applicant. Eligibility to occupy such a public\ntrust position is denied.\nDavid M. White             \nAdministrative Judge             \n",

Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all\nadjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 28, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On December\n14, 2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations).2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was originally\nassigned to another administrative judge on April 11, 2007, but transferred to me on May 22, 2007,\ndue to workload considerations. I convened a hearing on June 14, 2007, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. The government offered three exhibits, all of which were admitted without\nobjection (Gx. 1 - 3). Applicant testified and introduced nine exhibits (Ax. A - I),  which were\nadmitted without objection. I also left the record open to receive Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nsubmission, which is admitted without objection as Ax. J. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nJune 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged through the SOR that Applicant accrued $25,833 in delinquent debt\nfor 25 unpaid accounts, 19 of which (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.l, 1.m - 1.o, 1.q - 1.y) have\nbeen referred to collection agencies. The remaining accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.i - 1.k) were charged\noff as business losses. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. Her admissions are\nincorporated herein as facts. Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible, and she responded to questioning\nfrom government counsel and the bench in a candid and straightforward manner. She also was well\ninformed about the status of her past due debts and her current finances. After a thorough review of\nthe transcript and exhibits, I make the following findings of additional relevant fact:\nApplicant is 29 years old and has worked since October 2004 for a health care and medical\ninsurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for TRICARE,\nthe Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families.\nShe is a single mother of three children, ages 10, 7, and 18 months. Applicant and the father of the\nyoungest child were married in March 2006, but separated soon thereafter. Her estranged husband\ngives her about $400 each month as child support pending a final divorce decree. The other two\nchildren were born of a previous relationship. Applicant receives from their father $852 each month\nin court-ordered child support.\nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant worked for three years in a medical services\ncompany, but was laid off in 2003 when the company was sold. From March 2003 until June 2004,\n\n4\nshe was unemployed while studying to be a medical assistant. In June 2004, she started a medical\nclinic internship that she hoped would lead to full-time employment at a medical clinic, but left after\nthree hurricanes hit the area that summer and forced the business to close. Thereafter, she was hired\nby her current employer.\nApplicant became pregnant with her youngest child in February 2005. A few months later,\nshe was diagnosed as a high-risk pregnancy and had to take medical leave because she was put on\nbed rest. Several of the medical bills listed in the SOR resulted from delays resolving her claims for\nshort-term disability benefits and gaps in her insurance coverage. (Ax. D) After the child was born\nin November 2005, Applicant returned to work, albeit briefly. In December 2005, she developed a\nhypertensive condition in her brain caused by other neurological abnormalities that kept her out of\nwork until early 2006. At that time, after several attempts, she had found a neurologist who\nprescribed an effective course of treatment. Despite continuing to suffer severe headaches and other\nsymptoms, Applicant\u2019s attendance at work has been excellent. As of the hearing, she was awaiting\na surgical procedure that will hopefully provide a permanent solution. As a result of her 2003 lay-off,\nand her inability to work through most of 2005, Applicant did not earn any reportable income in\n2004, and earned only $8,200 in reportable income in 2005. (Ax. F)\nAfter she was hired by her current employer in 2004, Applicant and her children moved in\nwith her parents to save money on living expenses, such as child care. Her grandmother and step-\ngrandfather lived a few doors away and were able to care for the children. However, she was forced\nto find her own place to live around mid-2005 when she learned her step-grandfather was a\nregistered sex offender. (Ax. E) With the new rent obligation, which she never missed (Ax. J), bills\nshe already was late in paying became delinquent when she had to take medical leave. Applicant had\nto rely on help from her parents and on her credit cards and other personal credit to make ends meet.\nWhen she returned to work in 2006, Applicant realized she would not be able to pay the debts\nshe had accrued over the previous three years. She consulted a bankruptcy attorney and began the\nprocess of filing for Chapter 7 protection. (Ax C) On March 7, 2007, she filed her petition, and, as\nof the hearing, no protests from her creditors had been received before the deadline, and all parties\nwere awaiting official discharge of her debts sometime in June or July of this year.\nIn April 2007, Applicant moved back in with her parents, but her children went to live with\nher estranged husband\u2019s sister. Applicant sends her the monthly child support from the children\u2019s\nfathers, and she also provides clothing, school supplies and other special needs as they arise.\nOtherwise, Applicant\u2019s only monthly expenses consist of a monthly self-storage rental ($89), a pay-\nas-you-go cell phone (average $20), and, in exchange for the use of her parents\u2019 car she pays the\ninsurance ($148). (Ax. I) She is trying to save at least $5,000 as contingency funds before she moves\nout and resumes caring for her children.\nApplicant has an excellent reputation at work. (Ax G) As evidence of her reliability and\ntrustworthiness, available information shows Applicant reported a violation of health information\nprivacy  laws when she witnessed a new employee she was training using another\u2019s social security\nnumber to access his records. (Ax. H)\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive. They apply to all adjudications\nor trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n A memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\n4\nSecurity to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of\ntrustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as\noriginally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\n Directive, 6.3.\n5\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, Section 2 lists the following factors: \u201c(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness\n6\nof the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) The\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; (7) The motivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, Section 2.\n7\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531(1988).\n8\n5\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\n3\nsuitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must reflect\n4\nconsideration of both disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative\nissue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case, as well as a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of all available relevant and material information.  The presence or absence of\n5\na disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an\napplicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nsensitive information. Further, the decision must include \u201cthe careful weighing of a number of\nvariables  known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past\n6\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d7\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to\nsensitive  information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information\non which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must\nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with\nsecurity clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\n8\npersuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. Resolution of any\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n10\n  \u201c(a) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (c) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n11\n6\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position should be resolved in\nfavor of the government.9\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n10\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations that Applicant owed at\nleast $25,000 in delinquent debts accrued between 2000 and 2006. Available information further\nshows she was unable to pay those debts, and has recently petitioned for discharge of her obligations\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These facts warrant consideration of Guideline F disqualifying\nconditions 19(a) and 19(c).  \n11\nBy contrast, available information shows Applicant accrued the listed debts as a result of\nunforeseen events, and through circumstances beyond her control. Applicant was unable to work for\nmore than a year due to a high risk pregnancy, and a subsequent medical problem that, after several\nfailed attempts in late 2006 and early 2007, is now being resolved. In 2004, her attempt to reduce\nexpenses by moving in with her parents and using her grandmother as daycare for her children was\nderailed when she learned her step-grandfather was a sex offender. No longer able to leave her\nchildren near that person, in 2005 she rented her own house, thereby impeding her ability to pay\nother bills. Soon thereafter, she endured a high-risk pregnancy that left her out of work for much of\n2006. Many of the listed medical bills resulted from improperly processed claims for disability\nbenefits and insurance claims.\nIn 2006, by the time she was again receiving steady income, Applicant\u2019s debts had, through\ninterest and penalties, outpaced her ability to pay or even settle them. Under the circumstances, it\nwas reasonable for Applicant to seek bankruptcy protection. Available information shows it is more\nlikely than not her debts have been discharged. She has also made the difficult decision to separate\nfrom her children, so she can significantly reduce expenses and save enough money for future\ncontingencies before she again obtains her own housing and rejoins her children. Applicant has\nvirtually no major expenses, and no new debts. Further, she has begun establishing good credit\nthrough her reliable payment of rent for the year before she moved in with her parents in April 2007.\nAll of the foregoing requires consideration of Guideline F mitigating conditions 20(a), 20(b), and\n\n \u201c(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n12\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b)\nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances; (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n See notes 6 and 7, supra.\n13\n7\n20(c)  On balance, and in light of all of the available information probative of this issue, I conclude\n12\nthis guideline for the Applicant.\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant is a mature adult,\n13\nwho now has a measure of financial stability for the first time in several years. She also appears to\nbe a productive and trustworthy employee. While bankruptcy is not an ideal solution to one\u2019s debts,\nunder certain circumstances, as presented here, it is the most reasonable and effective means for\nensuring one\u2019s financial problems will not continue to be a source of pressure or coercion. The\ncircumstances leading to her financial problems no longer exist, and she has taken what steps she\ncan to improve her financial standing so as to avoid similar problems in the future. As a matter of\ncommon sense, the facts presented in this case do not pose an unacceptable risk to the interests of\nnational security. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.y:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the information presented, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\nMatthew E.

The Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nDecember 14, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct)  of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\non December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official\namendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006,  this\ncase proceeds under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 27, 2006 and January 26, 2007, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February\n21, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was dated on February 28, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March\n14, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nApplicant's security clearance.  Applicant knowingly and voluntarily waived the 15-day notice rule.2\nThe government offered one exhibit, marked as Exhibit 1.  Applicant offered one exhibit, marked\nas Exhibit A.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation contained in the SOR.  The admission is incorporated\nherein as a finding of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 20-year-old data entry clerk employed by a federal contractor.   She is single\n3\nand has one child.   She is a high school graduate.   She has no military service, and this is her first\n4\n5\napplication for a security clearance.6\nWhen Applicant executed her security clearance application, on June 23, 2005, she answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201c27.  Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use\n\nId. at 10.\n7\nId. at 11.\n8\nId. at 37.\n9\nId. at 15.\n10\n4\nof Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d  She failed to disclose\nher use of marijuana from about 2002 to 2004.\nApplicant admitted that she lied on this one question on her SF 86.   She gave the following\n7\nstatement:\nBasically, I wanted to apologize, because, yes, I did lie on the SF 86.  But at the time,\nI was younger, and didn\u2019t really know what I was doing.  I had just gotten out of high\nschool, and I didn\u2019t really know the seriousness of the matter.8\nWhen asked what she had learned in the last two years, she replied:\nI learned a lot.  I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have a lot of the friends that I used to have.  I\nstopped talking to a lot of people.  Spiritually, I have changed my life, which\naltogether is going to change everything that I do, everything that I say, what, you\nknow, how I act.  I have matured, I believe, greatly with my daughter and with work.\nAnd my work ethic, I believe, has grown a lot more than when I first started.  Like\nthe witness said, at first, I never wanted to go to work because I didn\u2019t like it.  I had\njust gotten out of high school, all my friends were going out and having fun.  And I\nwas going to this job, not knowing anything, and so it was a big change for me.  And\nplus, I had a daughter at 17 years of age.  That\u2019s a big deal, it still is.  I\u2019m now only\n20 years old, and I have a two-year-old, but I\u2019ve learned to take care of the\nresponsibilities that I need to, and how I need to do it, and when I need to do it.9\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, who hired Applicant for her current job, testified.  Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor is also the grandmother of her daughter.  She had a career in the military, before working\nfor the government.   The witness made these observations about Applicant:\n10\n\u2022\n\u201cHer work ethic, since the time I hired her until now has improved 100%.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cShe has done a great job of changing her life, and that\u2019s why I came today.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u201cIt took her about nine months for her to grow up, to understand that this is a real world, this\nis a really good job.\u201d\n\nId. at 13-15.\n11\nId. at 22, 28-31.\n12\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n13\n5\n\u2022\n\u201cWhen I hired her, she did not realize the security level of the job; she didn\u2019t understand it.\nAll of her friends were just getting out of high school.  They worked at McDonald\u2019s, Burger\nKing, anything they could get their hands on.  But this was a real high-level job.  None of her\nfamily had ever worked for the government and none of them had ever had that expectation.\nSo she couldn\u2019t understand how serious this was.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cI am proud of her.  She\u2019s changed, she had to drop a lot of her friends, and she had to work\nin an environment that\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cI\u2019ve hired over 120 people, 85% of them between 18 and 21 years old.  Only about 15%\nmake it.  Those that don\u2019t just didn\u2019t understand the seriousness of this.  But I\u2019m proud to\nsay that I feel she has come a long way, not only in business, but as a mother.\u201d11\nAbout two months on the job, her supervisor heard rumors about Applicant\u2019s drug use.\nWhen she confronted Applicant, she denied using drugs.  After telling her about the seriousness of\nthe situation, and that \u201cwe have a lie detector which will get to the truth about this\u201d, Applicant\nadmitted her use of marijuana.  Her supervisor then called the facility security officer (FSO) and\nreported the false answer.  The FSO advised her the SF 86 had already gone forward, and that\nApplicant should inform the Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator when an interview was\nconducted, which she did.  \n12\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines are\ndivided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common-sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.13\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n14\nSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n15\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n16\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n14\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n15\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.16\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n17\n7\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n17\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b6 16.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant admitted that she lied on her security clearance application when asked about\nillegal drug use.  The government established its case under Guideline E.\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts; and\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nApplicant did not voluntarily come forward and admit her mistake.  It was only after being\nconfronted by her supervisor that the truth came out.  To her credit, she told the truth to the DSS\ninvestigator, and she has shown remorse for her omission.  Mitigating condition \u00b617(a) does not\napply.\nOn the other hand, Applicant has taken positive steps to avoid illegal drug use by no longer\nassociating with those with whom she smoked marijuana, she has matured, and now demonstrates\nresponsibility at her job, and she has shown responsibility in raising her child..  I base this on the\ntestimony of her supervisor, who although has a personal family relationship with Applicant, did not\nlet that relationship influence her decision to notify the FSO that Applicant falsely answered one\nquestion on her SF 86.  She placed the requirements of her job ahead of attempting to cover up for\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n18\nId.\n19\nId.\n20\n8\nApplicant (which she did not do).  I believe she is a person of integrity and character, and that her\ntestimony about Applicant is truthful and credible.  Mitigating condition \u00b6 17(d) is applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n18\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n19\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered her age (20),\n20\nher education, her employment, and what might have motivated her to be less than truthful.\nApplicant supplied a false answers on a security clearance application.  This is problematic because\ncandor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  If a person discloses their personal adverse information, then he or she is more likely\nto be trustworthy with confidential or classified information. \nApplicant was 18 and immature when she answered the SF 86.  She has had to grow up in\na hurry, especially having the responsibility of a young child.  She has turned her life around in the\nlast year and a half, understands the seriousness of her mistake, and I am confident she will not make\nthis kind of mistake in the future.  This is an isolated incident involving one question.  It happened\nover two years ago.  While one might argue that more time should elapse, the evidence shows that\nApplicant understands the need to protect classified information.  And the evidence shows that she\nis sufficiently mature and will now exercise good judgment and discretion that is expected of one\nwho holds a security clearance. \nI also place strong emphasis on her supervisor\u2019s testimony.  If she did not believe that\nApplicant was ready for a security clearance, she would not have testified.  I give her credence\nbecause she did what she had to do as a supervisor, not as the child\u2019s grandmother.  She notified\nsecurity about Applicant\u2019s false answer on the SF 86.  Her Army experience and her work for the\ngovernment have given her insight into what is required for a security clearance.  She has experience\nwith over a hundred people she has hired that are in Applicant\u2019s age range.  It is for these reasons\nthat I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 29, 2007, after the hearing,\n1\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states that she feels she did not present sufficient information\nat the hearing as to why she did not list the criminal charges against her in her Security Clearance\nApplication (SF-86).  She therefore restates her testimony on that issue.  She cites a Hearing Office\ndecision in a case she believes is similar to hers.  In that case, the applicant was granted a clearance.\nShe also submits three letters of recommendation from supervisors.  \nTo the extent that Applicant provides any evidence on appeal that was not presented at the\nhearing, the Board cannot consider it, since the Directive does not allow consideration of new\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  This applies to any additions to Applicant\u2019s testimony\nand the three letters of recommendation.  Moreover, Hearing Office decisions in other cases are not\nbinding  on the Board or on other Hearing Office judges.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s ability to cite a\nHearing Office decision in another case that appears to support Applicant\u2019s position does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision in this case is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24062 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 2005).\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s restatement of her testimony, there is no indication in the\ntranscript that Applicant was prevented during the hearing from presenting her explanation of her\nfailure to disclose her criminal conduct on her SF-86.  Moreover, the Judge included Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation in his decision, although it is clear from the decision that the Judge did not find\nApplicant\u2019s explanation credible.  Under the Directive, the Board must give deference to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.    \nThe Judge found that Applicant was involved in six criminal offenses between 1997 and\n2003 and that she falsified her SF-86.  The Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for her failure to disclose the information in question on her SF-86.  The Judge was not\nbound, as a matter of law, to accept Applicant\u2019s explanation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01676\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007).  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the evidence\nas a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

In 2005, she deliberately failed to disclose in her security clearance\napplication her four felony charges and her conviction for larceny under false pretenses. Applicant\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised by her criminal conduct, and\npersonal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 13, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based\non information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary\naffirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to\nclassified information.  Applicant answered the SOR on January 3 and January 24, 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 7, 2007. On April 5, 2007, with the parties\u2019\nagreement, I issued a notice of hearing convening a hearing for April 24, 2007. Applicant failed to\nappear at her scheduled hearing. On that day, she submitted a request for postponement explaining\nthat she was not able to appear at her hearing because her company\u2019s CEO convened an all-hands\nmeeting for April 24, 2007.  Based on Applicant\u2019s request, I reconvened the hearing on April 25,\n2\n2007. At the hearing, the government presented seven exhibits, marked GE 1-7. Applicant testified\non her own behalf, and presented no exhibits. DOHA received the transcripts (Tr.) on May 2 and 4,\n2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nOn February 26, 2007, the government moved to amend the SOR and provided Applicant\nwith notice and an opportunity to object to the government\u2019s motion and to answer the SOR. The\namended SOR corrected the allegation under SOR \u00b6 2.a (Guideline E), by adding the full text of\nquestion 23 of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application. It provided notice that the government also\nwas alleging Applicant had falsified question 23.f, in her security clearance application.  Applicant\n3\ndid not object to the amendment, and I granted the government\u2019s motion. (Tr. 26) \n\n  The motion was marked as Appellate Exhibit 1. The text of the new allegations is as follow: \u201cSOR \u00b6 2.b You\n4\ndeliberately provided false or misleading information regarding material facts in a continuance request you submitted\nto the DOHA on April 24, 2007, when you stated that \u201cDue to a mandatory ALL HANDS meeting that was hosted by\nthe CEO of X Corporation this morning, April 24, 2007, I was unable to attend my clearance, no such meeting took place\nyesterday.\u201d; and \u201cSOR \u00b6 2.c You deliberately provided false or misleading information regarding material facts to your\nemployer on April 24, 2007, when you told your supervisor words to the effect that you were unable to go to work on\nApril 24, 2007, because you had to attend a security clearance hearing. Whereas, in truth and fact, you failed to appear\nat your security clearance hearing that had been scheduled for April 24, 2007, and provided DOHA false or misleading\ninformation for your failure to attend said hearing, as set forth in subparagraph 2.b, above.\u201d \n  GE 8.\n5\n  GE 3 (FBI Identification Record, dated Nov. 22, 2005).\n6\n3\nOn April 25, 2007, the government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2 (Guideline E), by adding \u00b6 2.b\n(alleging that Applicant lied in her April 24, 2007, request for continuance), and \u00b6 2.c (alleging that\nApplicant lied to her supervisor when she requested leave from work on April 24, 2007, \u201cto attend\na security clearance hearing\u201d).  I denied the government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR, pursuant to\n4\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.10.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a - c, with explanations. She denied \u00b6 1.d, and \u00b6 2.a. In her\nJanuary 24, 2007, answer to the SOR, she had admitted \u00b6 2.a. At her hearing, she denied providing\nfalse information with the deliberate intent to mislead the government, and denied \u00b6 2.a. Her\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, the evidence as a whole, and considering\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old administrative project assistant. She has worked for a defense\ncontractor for approximately two years. Applicant is not married, but has four children, ages 16, 14,\n12, and 10. In 1994, she completed an associate\u2019s degree in computer science.\nIn June 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of uttering forged checks\n(felony offenses) and two counts of check forgery (felony offenses). In August 1997, Applicant was\narrested and charged with two counts of uttering forged checks (felony offenses), two counts of\ncheck forgery (felony offenses), and two counts of larceny under false pretenses (misdemeanors).5\nApplicant explained that the August 1997 charges were based on the same incidents that led to the\nJune 1997 charges. The court found her guilty of two counts of larceny under false pretenses, and\nsentenced her to serve 30 days in jail (suspended), to pay court costs, and to pay a $100 fine.6\nIn December 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with grand theft (a felony) and theft\nover $500. She was working as a cashier at a large retail store and allowed several family members\nto go through her cash register check out line without making payment for their merchandise. She\nbelieved she was being a good family member by allowing her family members to go through her\n\n  GE 2 (Applicant\u2019s interview, dated April 5, 2006), and GE4 (State criminal history record, furnished\n7\nDecember 20, 2005).\n  GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated October 27, 2005).\n8\n  This is contrary to her statement to a defense investigator in April 2006 (GE 2), in which she admitted the\n9\n1997 conviction and paying a fine. \n  GE 6.\n10\n  GE 7, and Tr. 42-52.\n11\n4\ncash register check out line without paying for their merchandise. (Tr. 60-61) The charges were nolle\nprosequi when the retail store witnesses failed to appear in court.7\nIn her October 2005 security clearance application,  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question\n8\n23.a, which asked whether she had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense.\nApplicant failed to disclose that in June and August 1997 she was charged with at least four counts\nof felony offenses (two counts of uttering forged checks and two counts of check forgery), and that\nin December 2003 she was charged with another felony, i.e., grand theft.\nApplicant claimed her failure to disclose the information was not deliberate and that she\nmade an honest mistake. She submitted several explanations for her failure to disclose the 1997\nfelony charges: 1) the 1997 felony charges were downgraded, and she pled to a misdemeanor; 2) she\nbelieved she only had to disclose felony convictions; 3) she was in a hurry to complete her SF 86,\nand misread the question; 4) she believed she did not have to disclose the misdemeanor conviction\nbecause it was more than seven years old and, as such, outside of the scope of question 23.f; and 5)\nin 1997, she was young and did not realize she was convicted of a misdemeanor until 2005-2006\nwhen her pay was garnished by the state to collect the unpaid fine.  Concerning the December 2003\n9\nfelony grand theft charge, and the charge for theft over $500, Applicant claimed she believed she did\nnot have to disclose them because the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 64).\nOn April 5, 2007, with the agreement of the parties, I issued a notice of hearing scheduling\nApplicant\u2019s hearing for April 24, 2007. On April 23, 2007, department counsel called Applicant to\nremind her of the scheduled hearing. She indicated she would attend her hearing. (Tr. 72) I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled, and noted on the record that Applicant failed to appear at her hearing. I\nissued an order requiring Applicant to show why her security clearance, if any, should not be revoked\nand the processing of her case terminated for failure to appear at her hearing as scheduled. That day,\nshe submitted a request for continuance explaining that she was not able to appear at her hearing\nbecause the CEO of her company convened an all-hands meeting for April 24, 2007.  I granted the\n10\ndelay, and reconvened the hearing on April 25, 2007. \nAt her hearing, Applicant admitted, and the evidence established, she lied in her request for\ncontinuance. There was no company all hands meeting scheduled, and she did not have to attend any\ncompany meetings on April 24, 2007. She also lied to her employer when she requested leave from\nwork on April 24, 2007, \u201cto prepare security clearance paperwork for an important clearance\nissue.\u201d  During her hearing, Applicant explained that on April 24, 2007, she had to attend a meeting\n11\nwith her daughter\u2019s school principal.

(Tr.\n12\n73) When asked why she did not inform the government in April 23, 2007, of her meeting with her\ndaughter\u2019s principal, Applicant stated she wanted to tell the administrative judge herself. (Tr. 73-74).\nApplicant expressed remorse for her past criminal behavior and stated she was sorry for\nproviding the wrong information in her security clearance application. She explained she was young\nand immature at the time of her 1997 offense. She claimed she has not been in trouble during the last\nthree years, and asked that her past mistakes not be considered against her. She averred she is\ndependable, truthful, and a hard-worker. Applicant highlighted that this was her first time applying\nfor a security clearance, and she did not know how to complete her security clearance application.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.\n13\n14\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\n\n  See Department of the Navy v.

Hereinafter, the particular paragraph of the Guidelines will be cited as part of the relevant\n19\ndisqualifying and mitigating condition. See n.1 supra.\n  It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\n20\nstatement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive\nbranch of the Government of the United States. Egan, 484 U.S. at 527 (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001). \n6\ninformation.  The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the\n15\nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.16\nThe responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n17\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest\nto ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who\nwill protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.18\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  The government established its case\n19\nunder Guideline J by showing that Applicant was involved in six offenses between 1997 and 2003.\nI also find, as discussed below under Guideline E, that Applicant deliberately falsified her 2005\nsecurity clearance application. Her falsification of the SF 86 is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, a\nfelony.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and\n20\nDC 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s past behavior, from 1997 to 2005, forms a pattern of criminal activity. Her\nfalsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct concerns raised by her past behavior. I am\nrequired to consider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of\nthe conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is\n\n  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 ( App. Bd. May 19, 2006).\n21\n  I specifically considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a): so much time has elapsed since\n22\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 32(d): there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\n  Guidelines \u00b6 15.\n23\n7\nrecent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the circumstances of the\nincidents alleged; and her rehabilitation.21\nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is recent and not\nisolated. Considering her criminal behavior, the nature and seriousness of her misconduct, her\nfalsification of the SF 86, her disregard for the law, and her lies in her request for continuance, I find\nher favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline J security concerns. Her behavior\nraises questions about her ability and willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect\nclassified information. Her falsification and lies weigh against a finding of rehabilitation and positive\nbehavioral changes. I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply.  Guideline J is decided\n22\nagainst Applicant.\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.23\nApplicant admitted she failed to disclose relevant information in her answers to SF 86\nquestions 23.a and 23.f. She further admitted she lied in her request for continuance. In light of\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, age, maturity, length of employment, the number of incidents that she failed\nto disclose, the seriousness of those incidents, and the circumstances surrounding those incidents,\nI find Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and made with the intent to mislead the government.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . ., and DC 16(e): personal conduct or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress . . ., apply.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude that none\napply. Applicant\u2019s falsification is recent. Considering the totality of the circumstances in her case,\nnot enough time has passed to mitigate the security concerns raised by her behavior. Furthermore,\nshe presented no evidence that she has reduced her vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined above under the discussions of Guidelines J,\nincorporated herein, I conclude none of the MCs apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s age, education, maturity, her two years working for a defense contractor, and that this\n\n8\nis her first time applying for a security clearance. As previously discussed, Applicant\u2019s overall past\nbehavior forms a pattern of criminal activity with significant adverse security implications. Her\nfalsifications bring to the forefront the criminal conduct concerns raised by her past behavior. Her\nfailure to provide truthful answers in her security clearance application shows she cannot be trusted,\nand show a serious lack of judgment. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the\noverall judgment and trustworthiness security concerns raised by her behavior.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The notice from the state also advised him if he did not take action on the\narrearage he would be subject to enforcement actions. Applicant stated he set up an allotment to pay\n$282 a month on this debt. He did not provide any documentation to support his claim.\nOn his security clearance application (SCA) Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to question 27c which\nasked in the last 7 years if he had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other\ndebts. Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to divulge that he owed taxes for several tax years was that\nbecause he did not own property he did not think he had to list his tax debts.  The wording of the\n6\nquestion specifically asks if there is a lien against his property. If he did not have property it is\nreasonable that he answered \u201cno\u201d even though he had delinquent taxes.

An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant failed to pay his taxes for several years and is in arrears\non his child support. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s debts are\nrecent and unpaid and he failed to provide any information or tangible evidence that his actions are\nnot likely to recur. His provided no proof that he has made any voluntary payments on either his tax\ndebts or child support debt. Rather the IRS applied overpayments to his delinquent tax debts and the\nenforcement division of the state\u2019s child support agency notified him that action would be taken if\nhe failed to make payments. He stated he started an allotment to pay his child support, but provided\nno proof that he has actually made a payment. In addition, he provided no explanation as to why he\nfailed to pay his taxes or his child support in the first place and why his taxes have been delinquent\nfor so many years. Although the balance on his delinquent taxes has been reduced, it has not been\nthrough a good faith effort. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nPersonal Conduct\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nI considered the applicability of Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). I previously found Applicant did not\ndeliberately falsify information when he responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 27c which asked if he had a lien\nplaced on his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts. Although he had failed to pay his taxes,\n\n7\nhe did not have any property and therefore he answered the question correctly. The question did not\nask him if he had unpaid taxes. I find no disqualifying conditions apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on\nfinancial considerations. Because I found Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SCA, I conclude\nhe has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. Therefore, I am\npersuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked as an airframe mechanic for a federal contractor\nsince 2000. He married in 1995. His wife was a Russian citizen and two years ago became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. His parents-in-law are Russian citizens, hold Russian passports, and live\nin the U.S. with Applicant and his wife and daughter. They have permanent residency status.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law served more than 30 years in the Russian Navy and retired at the rank of\nCaptain. He and his wife maintain contact with friends in Russia. Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B, foreign influence. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 16, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its preliminary decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign\ninfluence). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the President on December\n29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines). Applicant answered the SOR\nin writing on February 22, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 11, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on\nMay 16, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered three exhibits for admission\ninto the record, marked as GE 1-3. The exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. The\nGovernment offered nine exhibits for Administrative Notice. Eight of the exhibits were admitted and\nmarked as Administrative Notice (AN) I-VIII. The exhibit that was not admitted for Administrative\nNotice was offered as a GE 4 and was admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified\non his behalf and offered one exhibit, marked as AE A. The exhibit was admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 52 years old and has been employed as an airframe mechanic by a defense\ncontractor since 2000. He holds two federal licenses to maintain and modify aircraft. He served in\nthe Marine Corps from 1973 to 1977 and was honorably discharged. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Russia. He met her through a magazine advertisement and\ncorresponded with her for approximately a year before meeting her in person in London in 1994,\nwhere she was attending a language school.

Therefore, his wife had to start the time\nperiod upon their return and became a U.S. citizen approximately two years ago. Applicant and his\nwife have a nine year old daughter. His wife is a 3  grade school teacher and has received a\nrd\nprestigious honor for her teaching abilities. Applicant visited Russia once in 1998 to meet his in-\nlaws. He hopes to visit St. Petersburg one day. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are both citizens of Russia. They maintain Russian passports.\nThey moved to the U.S. in October 2005, to be with their only child and only grandchild. They live\nwith Applicant and his wife and daughter and have permanent residency status. They intend on\napplying for U.S. citizenship when they become eligible. Neither are employed outside the home,\nbut both assist in teaching their granddaughter Russian and assisting her with her studies. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law served in the Russian Navy from August 1953 to August 1984. He\nattained the rank of Captain and patrolled Russia\u2019s territorial waters. He receives a meager pension\nfrom the Russian government of approximately $50 a month. His wife also receives a $50 pension\nfrom the Russian government. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, while he was on active duty, was an\ninstructor for a period at the Russian Naval Academy. He is active on the Internet and accesses\nRussian websites. Applicant did not know if his father-in-law communicated by email to friends in\nRussia. His parents-in-law do receive phone calls from friends living in their former home town.\nThey also telephone the same friends in Russia  perhaps once every couple of months. Applicant and\nhis wife are their sole source of financial support. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 73 and his mother-in-law is 66. The father-in-law had no\nsiblings. The mother-in-law has one relative, a cousin, with whom she maintains contact. Since\nmoving to the U.S. they have not returned to Russia. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is very close to her parents and they are very close to their granddaughter.\nThey do not own any property in Russia, nor does Applicant or his wife. He is unaware if his father-\nin-law held a security clearance while in the Russian Navy.\nRussia is a federation with a government that consists of a president, prime minister, and a\nbicameral legislature.  It is a vast and diverse nation that is evolving politically, economically and\n1\nsocially.  Russia has an aggressive, ongoing and recent collection program targeting sensitive and\n2\nprotected U.S. technologies.  It\u2019s collection efforts include targeting multiple U.S. Government\n3\norganizations and all types of technologies since at least 1997.  Russia has significant intelligence\n4\n\nGE 4, Intelligence Threat Handbook, Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies for the Interagency\n5\nOPSEC support Staff (IOSS), June 2004, at 6. \nId. at 4.\n6\nId.\n7\nAN VI, Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States, Statement for the Record Before\n8\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee by Lieutenant General Michael D.

Many of the collection operations are directed at the U.S. in various capacities  Their\n5\n6\ncollection interests, both militarily and commercially are likely to continue.  In addition to Russia\u2019s\n7\ninvolvement in collection activities and espionage they also provide certain technology to other\ncountries.  They sell technology for both money and diplomatic influence.  Countries that Russia is\n8\n9\ninvolved with providing technology to and support include China, Venezuela, India and Iran.10\nRussia has significant problems involving terrorism and there is a heightened potential for\nterrorist actions against civilians.  The U.S. State Department warns that this dangerous situation\n11\nis likely to continue for some time.  Russia also continues to have serious human rights violations.\n12\n13\nThere is political pressure on the judiciary, intolerance of ethnic minorities, corruption and selectivity\nin enforcement of the law.  Russia\u2019s security forces were involved in additional significant human\n14\nrights problems, including alleged government involvement in politically motivated abductions,\ndisappearances, and unlawful killings.  In almost every aspect of the government there appears to\n15\nbe government pressure to limit freedom, including exerting influence over judicial decision, corrupt\nlaw enforcement, media restriction including harassment, intimidation and killing of journalists.16\nThere is widespread governmental and societal discrimination as well as racially motivated attacks.17\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Adjudication under this Guideline should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nBased on all of the evidence I find the Government established a disqualifying condition\nunder Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign family\nmember,...who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), FI DC 7(b) connections\nto a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information), and\nFI DC 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\napply.\nWhile family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying\nunder Guideline B, such ties do raise a prima facie security concern. This concern is sufficient to\nrequire an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the\napplicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance. 32\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s case requires the recognition that Russia is a top collector of sensitive\ntechnological information and is a leader in industrial espionage against the United States. It\u2019s\nhuman rights record reflects a government willing to exert its control in questionable, illegal and\nunacceptable ways to obtain its objectives. These actions threaten U.S. security interests. American\ncitizens with family members who are citizens of Russia could be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure.\nThe Government having established a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nrebut or mitigate the allegations. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens of Russia and reside with\nApplicant. His father-in-law spent more than 30 year in the Russian Navy. Those years were\ncharacterized as the \u201ccold war,\u201d a period of time that the two countries were on the brink of war and\nglobal disaster. He taught at the equivalent of the Russian Naval Academy. He and his wife live with\nApplicant to be close to their daughter and granddaughter. Applicant, his wife and daughter are very\nclose to her parents. Applicant\u2019s in-laws maintain contact with friends in Russia. They frequent\nRussian websites. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s devotion to the Russian Navy and attaining the rank\nof Captain cannot be discounted as to his loyalty toward his home country. These ties to Russia and\nApplicant\u2019s ties to his in-laws also cannot be discounted, as they create potential vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation, or pressure. Although Applicant is a very loyal citizen, his relationship with\nhis in-laws and their relationship with their daughter and granddaughter makes Applicant vulnerable\nto exploitation. Although the in-laws are permanent residents, the fact remains that they are Russian\ncitizens and have Russian passports. Based on the facts, their familial contact in the United States\nis limited to Applicant, his wife and daughter. Applicant\u2019s ties with his in-laws are constant and\nclose, creating security concerns. After considering all mitigating conditions under Foreign Influence\nMitigating Conditions 8(a)-(f), I conclude none of them apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n8\nI considered all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s credibility and demeanor while\ntestifying. I considered Applicant\u2019s devotion to his family, including his in-laws and his hopes to\nreturn to visit Russia one day. I also considered his in-laws\u2019 citizen status and intentions, and also\nhis father-in-law\u2019s retired status as Russian Navy Captain. Applicant obviously is a loyal American\nand a devoted family man. His wife has assimilated into the American culture and has become a\nhighly regarded teacher.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden\nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He established that his efforts have been successful and he has\nacknowledged his alcohol abuse, provided evidence of actions taken to overcome the problems, and\nestablished a pattern of responsible use. He also has shown that his behavior does not cast doubt on\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn December 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn January 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2007, for\na hearing held on May 30, 2007. Three government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were admitted\ninto evidence. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. The record was left open for 30 days\nfor additional material from Applicant and six documents were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. The transcript was received on June 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted, with explanation, the seven allegations relating to alcohol consumption.\nAfter a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the entire\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked as a radiology\ncontrol technician for the past five years. During 2005 he had two DUI arrests arising from drinking\nto excess. The first occurred in January 2005, when the staff of the bar in which he had been drinking\nalerted the police when he left. He was stopped by the police and given a sobriety test which showed\n.23% BAC on the breathalyser. He was fined $250, required to attend alcohol classes, and lost his\ndriver\u2019s license for four months but given a permit to drive to work. He completed the courses in late\nsummer 2005. \nThe second DUI occurred in December 2005, when he fish-tailed his car on the highway\nwhen he saw a police car and the car ended up in a snowbank and would not move. The officer\napproached, offered help, asked if he had been drinking, and gave him a sobriety test. The test\n\n3\nshowed .17% BAC. In April 2006 he appeared in court and pled guilty to DUI. As a result of his\naccelerated rehabilitation after the first offense, it was taken off his record, so the second offense is\nregarded as his first offense. \nApplicant lost his license as of January 2006 for nine months after the second offense, but\nin May 2006, when he appeared in court it was extended for one more year and he was not given a\npermit to drive to work. \nAs a result of the conviction, Applicant was placed on one-year probation until April 2007,\nwhich had terminated at the time of the hearing in this matter. He was required to obtain a drug and\nalcohol evaluation which he did in June 2007 (Exh. B, 4 and 5). He was also required to perform 100\nhours of community service which he has completed (Exh. B, 2 and 3), and to attend a weekend\nretreat which he has done. He then was required to meet with a counselor once a month for four\nmonths and had done so for two of the monthly sessions at the time of the hearing. He will have his\ndriver\u2019s license by the end of August after two more aftercare sessions pursuant to state\nrequirements. He also attends two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings per week and will do so for four\nmonths. He then goes into the third phase of aftercare which requires him to meet with a counselor\nevery three months for a year. Thus, the state requirements are extensive and spread over a lengthy\nperiod of time. \nApplicant advised his supervisor, colleagues, and family of his DUIs. His family consists of\nhis parents and a married brother who live a few miles from him. All are supportive of his efforts\ntoward rehabilitation. He has a college education, and purchased a home in June 2005. He has a\nstable relationship with a girlfriend whom he sees regularly and is supportive of his rehabilitation\nefforts. \nApplicant is well-regarded as a good worker who is reliable and trustworthy by his supervisor\nand colleagues (Exh. A and Tr. 33-40). He is an hourly employee and his pay has risen from $16 to\n$24 an hour in the five years he has worked for the company. He has had no security violations\nduring that time and has held a security clearance for nearly all of the five years of employment. \nApplicant very much regrets the two incidents that led to his arrests and believes he has\nchanged his life.He has matured greatly in the past two years (Tr. 26). The two DUIs were the only\nlegal difficulties he has ever had. He now rarely drinks and, if he does, it is a glass of wine with\ndinner. He does not drink and drive and will never again do so.  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\n\n4\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe government initiated this action under the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective\nSeptember 1, 2007, concerning alcohol consumption under Guideline G. The security concern is that\nexcessive alcohol consumption leads to exercise of questionable judgment and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness (AG 21) The specific concerns include alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence (AG 22 a). Those\nconcerns were met by establishing the two DUI\u2019s of Applicant in 2005. \nThe mitigating conditions (MC) in the revised guidelines have been expanded while\ncontinuing the include those in the old guidelines. These include the fact that so much time has\npassed and there it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment (AG 23 a), and that the individual acknowledges his alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern\nof responsible use if the person is an alcohol abuser (AG 23 b). I find that Applicant has\nacknowledged his alcohol abuse, provided evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and\nestablished a pattern of responsible use under AG 23 (b). Also, the behavior does not cast doubt on\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment which is now an alternative to application\nof a strict passage of time factor pursuant to AG 23 (a). I find the allegations are mitigated. \nAnother mitigating condition requires successful completion of alcohol counseling and\nrehabilitation (AG 23 d). Since the process is still on-going for Applicant and, as required by the\nstate, will be for another year so it is not applicable. Another requires that there be no previous\nrelapse (AG 23 c). Since there was a prior treatment less than a year earlier, this also is inapplicable.\n\n5\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nBased on that analysis, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s age at the time of the offences, his record\nof work stability, his rehabilitation efforts to remedy his alcohol problems, and the unlikelihood of\na recurrence, justifies application of the whole person analysis. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a\nsecurity clearance to him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2 of the Directive,\nwhich is pending revision to incorporate them. A copy of the applicable AG was  provided to Applicant with the SOR.\nA copy of this amended notice was served on Department Counsel and Applicant by email on June 13, 2007.\n2\n2\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor who admitted occasional use of\nmarijuana with decreasing frequency over a number of years. His most recent use was after\nsubmission of his security clearance application, while holding an interim clearance. Recently, he\nfinds marijuana use distasteful, but used it anyway due to peer pressure. He could not rule out future\nuse under foreseeable circumstances. Drug involvement security concerns raised by this inability or\nunwillingness to follow rules and regulations, and lack of trustworthiness and independent good\njudgment were not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on November 17, 2003, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as an electrician. On December 29, 2006, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR\ndetailed reasons, under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\n1\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized statement dated March 16, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of the factual allegations, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. On April 23, 2007, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. The case was\nreassigned to me on May 7, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June 1, 2007, and an amended\nnotice of hearing, changing only the location, was issued on June 13, 2007.  The hearing was held\n2\nas scheduled on June 28, 2007. The Government offered two exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered\none exhibit that was marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr) on July 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b,\npertaining to drug involvement under AG H.

After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He\nheld an interim clearance during some of the time since he first applied in 2003, but is unsure of the\nexact dates involved.  He admitted to using marijuana approximately once per year during the seven\n3\nyears preceding his security clearance application, and to one additional use in August 2005 while\nhe held an interim clearance, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He further admitted using marijuana\nwith friends once or twice weekly while in high school, and once or twice monthly from 1985 to\n1990. In 1990, his employer started a drug-prevention program, including urinalysis testing. His use\ndeclined to three or four times a year until 1993, then to about once a year until his last use in August\n2005.  \n4\nApplicant stated that he has not enjoyed smoking marijuana for many years, and has turned\nit down on many occasions.  He attributed his more recent uses to \u201ccuriosity\u201d and, essentially, peer\n5\npressure. Each use was in a social setting, sharing marijuana provided by someone else. He equated\nits wrongfulness to running a red light \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see the harm in it.\u201d He said future use was\n\u201cunlikely,\u201d and more unlikely if he was granted a clearance, but he could not rule it out.  He could\n6\nnot explain why having a clearance made future use more unlikely when criminal laws and company\npolicy against drug use did not deter him, and he used marijuana in the past while holding an interim\nclearance.  \n7\nThere is no evidence of Applicant\u2019s drug use except his candid admissions. All of his\ncompany-administered urinalysis test results have been negative.  Being honest in connection with\n8\nthe security clearance process is more important to him than actually receiving a clearance.9\nApplicant was entirely credible in his testimony during the hearing. He did not submit any testimony\nor documentary evidence from others concerning his character, reliability or trustworthiness.\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n10\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n11\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n12\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n4\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information. AG H is the\napplicable guideline in this case. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n10\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n11\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n12\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nRegulation, Appendix 8, Guideline H \u00b6 24.\n16\n5\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n13\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n14\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n15\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\" so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\n unfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\n\u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d16\nThe SOR alleges, and Applicant admits to, use of marijuana on multiple occasions between 1996\nand August 2005, including while he held an interim clearance after submission of his security\nclearance application.\n\nDrug abuse is defined as the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\n17\napproved medical direction. Regulation, Appendix 8, Guideline H \u00b6 24(b).\nTr. at 55.\n18\n\u201cDuly qualified medical professional\u201d means a physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist. Regulation,\n19\nAppendix 8, Guideline H \u00b6 25(d). \n6\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under two drug involvement disqualifying\nconditions (DI DC). DI DC 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d)  applies because Applicant admittedly used\n17\nmarijuana approximately once a year during the period alleged. DI DC 25(g) (\u201cany illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance\u201d) also applies.  Applicant admittedly used marijuana while\nholding an interim security clearance. The security concerns from this casual and infrequent social\nmarijuana use are not so much with respect to Applicant\u2019s temporarily impaired judgment, but bear\ndirectly on his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. No other DI DC\napplies in this case.\nI have considered all of the possible drug involvement mitigating conditions (DI MC). DI MC\n26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior occurred over a long period\nof time, including about 15 years during which his company had an active drug prevention program.\nHis most recent use was less than two years ago, and occurred while his current clearance application\nwas pending and he held an interim clearance. Applicant himself would not expressly rule out future\nuse. No prediction can yet be made that recurrence is unlikely. Applicant\u2019s history of casual drug use\nwhen peer pressure overcomes his minimal self-control and stated distaste for the results, casts\nongoing doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and good judgment. \nApplicant said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind signing the statement of intent with automatic revocation\nof clearance for any violation,\u201d  has largely disassociated himself from drug-using associates and\n18\ncontacts, and has changed the environment where drugs were used, all of which may mitigate\nsecurity concerns under DI MC 26(b) by demonstrating intent not to abuse drugs in the future.  The\nremaining such possible indicator listed under DI MC 26(b) is an appropriate period of abstinence.\nApplicant\u2019s abstinence period has been only 23 months, and while he said he had no plans to use\nmarijuana in the future, he candidly refused to rule it out. The possibility of losing his security\nclearance and job did not deter him from regular drug use between 1990 and 2005. He has not shown\nsufficient rehabilitation that signing a statement of intent would now be sufficient to demonstrate\nintent not to abuse drugs in the future, when company policy and criminal prohibitions were\ninsufficient to prevent past drug abuse.  \nDI MC 26(c) involves abuse of prescription drugs, so it does not apply. DI MC 26(d)\n(\u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional\u201d)  does not apply. Applicant offered no evidence of having\n19\nentered or completed any rehabilitation program, and no duly qualified medical professional\nprognosis was provided. \n\n7\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. He has regularly, albeit with decreasing frequency, used\nmarijuana on social occasions for about 25 years. He was not deterred by the fact such use is illegal,\nor by the potential adverse impact on his employment or security clearance. He engaged in each of\nthe admitted offenses voluntarily. He is mature and fully accountable for his choices. The only factor\nhe cited to make recurrence less likely was that he would not want to use drugs if he held a clearance,\nbut admitted his last use occurred while he held an interim clearance.\nApplicant has been forthright and honest about his actions, without which they would\nprobably be unknown.  However, his more recent history of drug abuse is an ongoing security\nconcern in large part because it occurred due to peer pressure, and even though he did not enjoy the\nexperience. This indicates that he is easily persuaded to commit an illegal and distasteful act to\nplease others, at least in the perceived absence of swift and sure sanctions, and reflects poorly on his\nself-control, trustworthiness, and ability or willingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. It\nis not clearly in the interest of national security to grant him access to classified material.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline\n\nExec.

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On February 26, 2007, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive (Directive),  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs\nissued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy\nof the Directive and the applicable Guidelines.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 26,\n2007 and April 16, 2007, and requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.\nThe Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 31, 2007.  The FORM\ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 9.  By letter dated  June 14, 2007, a copy of the\nFORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or\nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on June 28, 2007.  He did not submit\nadditional information within the required time period.  On September 10, 2007, the case was assigned\nto me for a decision.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains eleven allegations of disqualifying conduct under revised Adjudicative\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k.)  (Item 1.)  Applicant admitted all\neleven allegations, totaling approximately $18,000.  His admissions are admitted herein as findings\nof fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old and employed as a cameraperson/editor by a government contractor.\nIn July 2005, when he completed a security clearance application (SF-86), he reported he was married\nin 1999 and separated from his wife in August 2002.  (Item 1.)  His current marital status is not clear.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1987 to 1991.  He received a bachelor of arts degree\nin 1997. He has been steadily employed since 1997, and he has worked for his present employer since\n2001. He reported two judgments and seven financial delinquencies on his July 2005 SF-86. He\nacknowledged the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. through 1.k. on his SF-86. He stated on the SF-86 that\nhis debts occurred while he was in college, and he further stated he had saved money to pay his\ndelinquencies and intended to pay them. (Item 1.)\n\n3\nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about his financial delinquencies on January\n11, 2007.  He acknowledged the debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h. of the SOR and admitted he had\nnot  paid or settled those debts.  He suggested he be granted a conditional security clearance until his\ndelinquent debts were paid off. He failed to provide evidence that any of the alleged debts had been\npaid.  He stated he would have paid his debts sooner if he had known that he would receive a security\nclearance after having done so.  (Item 7 at 5.)\nApplicant\u2019s 2005 credit bureau report shows that at least three of his delinquencies were turned\nover for collection in 1999. (Item 9.)  Nothing in the record suggests he sought or participated in credit\ncounseling.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. \nThe revised AG set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of\nan applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination\nas to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\n\n Guideline F, \u00b6 19(a) reads: \u201cInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d Guideline F, \u00b6 19(c) reads: \u201cA history\n3\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2013Financial Considerations\nAn applicant\u2019s failure to live within his or her means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  See Guideline F, \u00b6 18.\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was responsible for eleven unsatisfied delinquent debts\ntotaling approximately $18,000.  The allegations raised security concerns under two Guideline F\ndisqualifying conditions, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   Applicant admitted responsibility for all eleven debts\n3\nand asserted in July 2005 and in January 2007 that he had saved money to pay his debts.  His answer\nto the SOR in March and April 2007 indicated he had failed to satisfy any of the eleven debts.  \nThrough Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence, the Government established that\nApplicant had a history of not meeting his financial obligations and was unable or unwilling to satisfy\nhis debts as specified in Guideline F, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \nSeveral conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial\ndelinquencies.  Unresolved financial delinquency might be resolved if it happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(a))\nAdditionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  (Guideline F,\u00b6 20(b))  Still other mitigating\ncircumstances that might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d)).\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies are numerous, long-standing, and continue\nto the present day.  All of his financial delinquencies remain unresolved, suggesting that the\ncircumstances that caused these delinquencies are likely to continue in the future, thereby casting\ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Accordingly, \u00b6 20(a)\ndoes not apply as a mitigating condition.  Applicant attributes his financial delinquencies to debts\naccrued in college. The record shows he graduated from college in 1997 and has been steadily\nemployed since  then.  Thus, the facts do not of themselves establish that Applicant\u2019s unresolved\nfinancial delinquencies occurred while he was a student, were largely beyond his control, or that he\nacted reasonably under the circumstances.  Nothing in the record suggests Applicant contacted his\n\n5\ncreditors to negotiate payment or settlement plans, even though he said, in July 2005 and January 2007\nthat he had saved money to pay his creditors and intended to do so. Accordingly, I conclude \u00b6 20(b)\ndoes not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nNothing in the record suggests Applicant has sought or participated in financial counseling\nand the evidence strongly shows his underlying financial problems are neither resolved nor under\ncontrol.  Accordingly, I conclude that \u00b6 20(c) is inapplicable.  \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies date from 1999.  His record statements suggest he\nperceived the award of a security clearance as a quid pro quo for paying his debts, and he appeared\nunwilling to act on his obligation to pay his creditors and honor his financial commitments.\nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant the application of \u00b6 20(d).   See ISCR\nCase No. 01-21030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 7, 2004).\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe revised AG and the Directive require that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension. His  history of not\nmeeting his financial obligations and his inability to pay his debts over a period of several years raises\na security concern because it suggests a lack of good faith. Twice he promised to pay his delinquent\ndebts, and twice he failed to do so. Since he has not sought consumer credit counseling or assistance\nin learning how to manage his finances, Applicant has failed to demonstrate his delinquencies will not\ncontinue to be security concerns in the future. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed,\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant\nshould not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nevidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense\nDirective, 5220.6., as amended.  I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor who had two alcohol related\ndriving incidents. He did not falsify his June 28, 2005 security application. He mitigated the security\nconcerns raised under the alcohol consumption and personal conduct guidelines. Applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nAfter a review of the case file, Department Counsel requested a hearing within 20 days of receipt of Applicant\u2019s\n2\nanswer. Applicant was notified that the Government requested a hearing in a letter dated May 15, 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated March 26, 2007.\n3\nGE 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated June 28, 2005).This was an EPSQ Version 2.2.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 28, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On February 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR,\n1\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn March 26, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave an administrative determination (decision on the record). He specified that he did not wish to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. However, Department Counsel requested that the case\nbe scheduled for a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2007. I scheduled the hearing\n2\nfor July 18, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on July 18, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-6) were admitted without objection. Applicant did not submit any\nexhibits at the hearing. Applicant testified in his own behalf. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record\nopen until July 23, 2007. Applicant submitted a packet of information which was marked as\nApplicant Exhibit (AE A). Department Counsel had no objection to the post hearing submission. The\nhearing transcript was received on July 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted to allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c in the SOR under\nGuideline G and denied allegations in subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He also denied the allegation\nin subparagraph 2.a under Guideline E.  The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After\n3\na complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  After high school graduation\n4\nin 1982, he attended community college courses. He has worked for his current employer for ten\nyears. Applicant submitted a security clearance (SF 86) application on June 28, 2005 and holds a top\n\nId.\n5\nTr.50.\n6\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, supra, note 3 at 1.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 55.\n9\nGE 3 (District Court Traffic System Citation).\n10\nTr 59; 60; 63; and 64.\n11\nGE 4(Incident Report, dated December 12, 2002); Tr. 68; 69; and 70.\n12\n4\nsecret clearance.  Applicant is thrice divorced and has three adult children. He is engaged to be\n5\nmarried.6\nApplicant started drinking in high school. In September 1985, when he was 21 years old,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with Operating under the Influence of Liquor/Drugs. He was\nfound guilty and his driving license was suspended.  He admits consuming alcohol, at times to the\n7\npoint of intoxication, from 1982 to at least June 2006.8\nApplicant worked steadily in the security field until an accident at work in 1993. He was hit\nby a generator which damaged three discs in his lower back. He was out of work on Worker\u2019s\nCompensation for about a year and a half. He worked part-time after his recovery until 1996. Since\nthat time he has been with his current employer.  In 1997, he received a clearance for Sensitive\n9\nCompartmented Information (SCI).\nOn December 22, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.\nHe received a Probation Before Judgment and was fined approximately $300. His driver\u2019s license\nwas restricted for one year. He attended a Victim Impact Panel. He successfully completed probation\non April 4, 2002.  \n10\nApplicant was not court ordered to alcohol counseling; however, at that time he and his wife\nwere in marriage counseling for his wife\u2019s drinking problems. His wife wanted Applicant to\naccompany her to a neighborhood bar in the evenings. Applicant was having difficulties in his\nmarriage at the time of the 2000 incident. He did not want to reveal the details of his wife\u2019s behavior\non the night of December 22, 2000. He arrived home early to surprise her, but had a painful\nexperience.11\nApplicant worked occasionally for a friend as a bouncer in his bar. On December 12, 2002,\nApplicant visited the bar, but was not actually working that night. When he arrived, the bouncer\nasked him for his help. The bouncer was attempting to get one unruly person out of the bar.\nApplicant assisted his friend and saw the man had a gun. At that point, Applicant had not had\nanything to drink. After the man finally left, Applicant remained in the bar and had two beers and\nan alcohol shot. The ousted bar patron was identified as an off duty policeman. He returned to the\nbar and threatened Applicant.  When Applicant exited the bar sometime later, the man who had\n12\n\nId. \n13\nTr. 61.\n14\nGE 5(Clearance Decision Statement, dated August 25, 2004).\n15\nThe decision also listed criminal conduct based on the arrest for DWI in 2000.\n16\nApplicant voiced his disagreement with certain facts in the decision. Specifically, he denies that he violated\n17\nhis probation or that he drove while intoxicated during that probation.\nGE 3, supra note 10.\n18\nTr. 93.\n19\n5\nbeen ousted was waiting for him. The man tried to stop Applicant and his friend from leaving.\nApplicant used a cell phone and called the police because the man had a gun. \nThe county police filed a report. When the police responded, they found Applicant and the\noff duty police officer. There were inconsistent stories in the report about the off duty officer\nthreatening Applicant with his gun. The incident report identified Applicant as the victim who called\nin to report that an off duty officer pulled a gun on him. Applicant acknowledged that he had a few\ndrinks prior to leaving the bar. No charges were filed after the incident. Applicant told his security\nofficer about the incident as well as his attorney. They both recommended that Applicant not file\ncharges against the off duty police officer.13\nApplicant was interviewed five times in 2003 and 2004 by NSA for concerns about his\nalcohol incidents. He volunteered information at the hearing that he was given a polygraph which\nhe did not pass during those interviews. He was adamant that the investigators twisted his words and\nrepeatedly asked the same questions concerning his drinking habits.  He recalled that during the time\nof the interviews, he was working 16 hour days and had to request breaks. 14\nNSA issued an August 25, 2004 Clearance Decision Statement holding that Applicant did\nnot meet the standards for access to NSA/CSS/ SCI under Director of Intelligence Directive (DCID)\n6/4, Personnel Security Standards and Procedures Governing Eligibility for Access to SCI.  The\n15\nbasis for the decision was alcohol consumption and personal conduct.   The report summarizes\n16\ntestimony from Applicant during the various interviews.  \n17\nAt the hearing, Applicant denied drinking during his probationary period in 2000. The\nclearance decision summarizes that at one point he admitted that and then retracted the statement.\nThe government exhibit from the Motor Vehicle Department does not reflect a violation of that\nprobation.   Applicant reported his current drinking habits as perhaps a couple of beers when he\n18\nshoots pool with his neighbor. His stress was visible when answering repeated questions about his\nconsumption of alcohol. He did not want to relive the very negative experience that he had during\nthe NSA interviews when answering questions during a polygraph.  He was adamant in that his\n19\nwords were taken out of context and misused. He credibly explained that the interviews were\noverbearing and that he was told to answer questions in a certain manner so that he could pass the\npolygraph.\n\nAE A (Letters of Appreciation 1999 through 2000).\n20\nAE A (Performance Appraisals from 1999 through December 27, 2005).\n21\nId.\n22\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n23\n6\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance questionnaire on June 28, 2005, he\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to question 32: Your Investigation Record-Clearance Action To your knowledge\nhave you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you\never been debarred from government employment?  (Note: An administrative downgrade or\ntermination of a security clearance is not a revocation.)\nApplicant denied that he intentionally falsified his security application. He did not fill out the\nelectronic form for his clearances. He also does not recall the 2005 form. When he is out in the field,\nhis security manager handles the forms. Applicant states there have been clerical errors before in his\npaperwork. Applicant stated at NSA they updated paperwork every year and typically he just signs\nhis name to it. He read the question at the hearing and stated that he checks with his security manager\nbefore answering any questions. He recalls the April 2003 security application form as his last. Many\ntimes Applicant just signed the signature page. He does not have access to EPSQ. He does not have\na copy of the 2005 form. He believes he filled it out while he was on the road. Thus, he may have\nfaxed the information and not seen the completed form at all.   \nApplicant still consumes alcohol in moderation. He reports that the amount varies as to\nwhether he is having dinner out or shooting pool in a club. He drinks about twice a month\n(sometimes beer or wine or whiskey).  During his marriage counseling, he was given specific alcohol\nassessments for alcohol dependency and the physician found that Applicant did not meet the criteria\nfor alcohol dependence. Applicant attended meetings with his second wife who was a member of\nAlcoholic Anonymous. He does not drink and drive. He does not drink every day. Applicant now\nlives in a different state. He is no longer in a marriage where alcohol play a major role. He does not\nfrequent bars due to his demanding work schedule. \nApplicant enjoys his current position and is very committed to its success. He is a well\nrespected employee and a valued member of the team. He maintains a professional appearance and\nsets a good example to the other staff. He displays a high degree of proficiency and professionalism\nin his work.  He has received many letters of appreciation and  accommodation.  He has excellent\n20\nrapport with his customers and his work exceeds expectations.  His most recent Performance\n21\nAppraisal (2005) rates him as a superior employee.22\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n23\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n24\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n25\n Id.\n26\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n27\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n28\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n29\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n30\n7\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n24\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n25\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n26\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n27\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n28\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n29\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  \n30\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\n \n\nAG \u00b6 21.\n31\nISCR Case NO. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).\n32\nId.\n33\n8\nGuideline G(Alcohol Consumption) The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.31\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested in\n1985 and 2000 for alcohol related driving incidents. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b622(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents\nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent) applies. Applicant admitted that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point\nof intoxication, from 1982 to at least 2006. Thus, AC DC AG \u00b621(b) (habitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) arguably applies.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Alcohol\nConsumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) AG \u00b623 (a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). There are\nno \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based on\n\u201ca careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.  If the\n32\nevidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d, then\nan administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged\ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  AC MC \u00b623 (a)\n33\nhas some applicability in this case. Applicant was found guilty of DUI in 1985 when he was 21. He\ndid not have any alcohol driving incidents until 2000 when he was in a marriage crisis. He was given\na Probation Before Judgment and successfully completed probation.  His alcohol use was in part due\nto the extreme emotional distress created by his wife\u2019s problems with alcohol. The incident in 2002\nwas noted because he called the police when he felt threatened. No charges were filed. Thus, the last\nalcohol driving incident was seven years ago. While other emotional crisis may possibly occur in the\nfuture, he is not in that marriage. He has changed his drinking habits and does not drink and drive. His\npast conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. The\nwhole person analysis, infra, provides additional discussion of mitigating circumstances\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) The Concern Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n34\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\n9\nApplicant completed his security clearance application on June 28, 2005. The government\nestablished that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF 86 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to question\n32. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to this question. When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing\nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.\nAn administrative judge must determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.   For Personal Conduct\n34\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar forms\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) to\napply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified that he does not recall the 2005 security form and that he usually\nsigns the form and his security officer transmits the data if Applicant is in the field. He was also\ncredible in his statement that he checks with his security officer before he answers any questions\nbecause he understands the importance of them. He has gone through the process a number of times\nand did not have a copy of the 2005 application form prior to the investigation that began in 2006. At\nthe hearing, he looked at the question and stated he would check with his security officer before\nanswering it because it talks about suspension or revocation and he believes it was a downgrade\nbecause he still has a clearance. I find that he did not intentionally falsify his answer to this question.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nApplicant was candid in his demeanor and testimony at the hearing. He acknowledged that he\ndid not want a hearing because he had gone through the NSA interviews and had his words taken out\nof context. He was forthright in acknowledging anxiety at this hearing because he has responded to\nall the interviews and questions concerning his past behaviors truthfully and it is still an issue. He still\nis upset when he recalls the failed polygraph and the circumstances of the questioning. \nHe has completed his alcohol probation and does not have a diagnosis. He does not drink and\ndrive. He is no longer in the marriage that contributed to the 2000 alcohol incident. He has a top secret\nclearance and enjoys his work. He has letters of appreciation and commendations over the years.\nDespite his prior crisis in his marriage in 2000, he continued to perform in his work.  He never\n\n10\nmishandled classified information and continued to work on a regular basis. His circumstances have\nchanged and his life is devoted to work. He works long hours and lives a quiet life. Although he admits\nthat he still drinks alcohol, his description is such that it really depends on circumstances as to whether\nhe drinks or how much. He is adamant that he does not drink and drive. He no longer works as a\nbouncer for his friend. In fact, he lives in another state.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concern pertaining to his alcohol\nconsumption and his personal conduct.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated February 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the specific factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j of the SOR. He denied the underlying conduct implied in the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.l with explanations. For example, he agreed that shots were fired into the house of attorney-witness. He, however, denied he did the shooting or that he is a suspect. As to the remaining allegations, he denied that the factual allegations are properly raised under Guideline E. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. 9 Applicant is 47 years old and works as a systems engineer for a Department of Defense contractor. He received a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1997 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science earlier. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force for five years and for seven years in the Air Force Reserve at the rank of Captain. He has held a security clearance since 1983, without any violations.10 Applicant married in 1986. His two daughters from this marriage are now 20 and 15. He and his wife separated in 1999 after he learned about her infidelity. Both 11 Applicant and his former wife obtained counsel in 1999. His former wife\u2019s first attorney withdrew from representation on October 8, 1999. Applicant also changed attorneys twice between October 1999 and February 2000. 12 Applicant\u2019s former wife\u2019s second attorney testified on beh",

On January 30, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 6, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on February 26, 2007, and requested a hearing\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\nBecause counsel mutually agreed, I actually convened the hearing late on Monday, March 10, 2008 to\n1\nresolve preliminary issues.\nIn its memorandum for post hearing submissions, the government listed these exhibits as 2 through 7, and\n2\nin a later response, Applicant\u2019s attorney references these exhibits as Attachments 2 through 7. The cover letter\nfrom counsel is listed by the government as exhibit 8.\nAE E (Copy Notice of Termination of Spousal Maintenance or in the Alternative a Motion to Modify Spousal\n3\nMaintenance filed by attorney-witness in the other highly contested divorce case he handled around the same\ntime he represented Applicant\u2019s wife); AE F (Order submitted in this same case by attorney-witness); AE G\n(Article published on the internet regarding the wife in the other highly contested case and her conduct related\nto her efforts to take custody of her son from a prior marriage). The government objected to Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission of these exhibits, marked by Applicant\u2019s counsel as Attachments 5 through 7. On April 18, 2008,\nI issued an Order, requesting Applicant to brief the reasons for the submissions of these exhibits and gave\nthe government an opportunity to respond.\n2\nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 5, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 3, 2008, and I received the\ncase assignment on January 7, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 9,\n2008, for a one-day hearing on January 31, 2008. Following several telephone\nconferences with counsel, I cancelled the hearing and rescheduled this case for a two-\nday hearing on a mutually agreed upon date. DOHA issued an amended notice of\nhearing on February 21, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 11,\n2008.  The government offered 18 exhibits (GE) 1 through 18, which were received and\n1\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Four witnesses testified on behalf of the\ngovernment. Applicant and four witnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted one\nexhibit (AE), which was received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 20, 2008. I held the record open\nuntil April 11, 2008, for the submission of additional matters by both parties. On April 9,\n2008, Applicant submitted his response, including attachments 1 through 7. The\ngovernment submitted one additional document and its response to Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission on April 10, 2008. The government submitted a copy of the requested 2001\ncourt order as did Applicant (as attachment 1 to his submission). I marked this exhibit as\nJoint Exhibit 1. Applicant timely submitted six additional documents, which I have\nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) B through G.  The government objects to the\n2\nadmission of AE E, AE F, and AE G as beyond the scope of the post-hearing order for\nsubmissions and as not relevant to the case.  AE B, AE C, and AE D are admitted into\n3\nevidence without objection. The record closed on May 8, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nOn October 18, 2007, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR. On\nNovember 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the motion to amend through counsel.\nApplicant objected only to new allegation 1.k. At the hearing, I reviewed each and every\nrequest to modify existing allegations and to add four new allegations under Guideline\nE. After hearing argument on each proposed amendment and new allegation, I granted\n\nThree judges heard aspects of Applicant\u2019s divorce case. The judges are referenced as Judge #1, Judge #2\n4\nand Judge #3, the order in which they appeared as the presiding judge.\n3\nthe government\u2019s request to amend allegations 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g.  (Tr. 12-13, 15,\n20) I also granted the government\u2019s request to add allegations 1.l, 1.m and 1.n. and to\nomit allegation 1.d as duplicative. (Tr. 13, 32, 33) I denied the government\u2019s request to\nadd allegation 1.k. (Tr. 25) For due process reasons, I also denied the government\u2019s\nrequest to allege under Guideline I the issue raised in proposed allegation 1.k. (Tr. 26-\n28)\nAs a result of the above rulings, the original SOR is amended as follows:\nAllegation 1.a now reads: \u201cYou were charged with Third Degree Criminal\nTrespassing on or about [ . . .] 2000 in [. . . .], based on a complaint filed by your ex-\nwife\u2019s divorce attorney. On or about [ . . .] 2000, the charge was dismissed.\u201d\n Allegation 1.c now reads: \u201cOn or about . . . ., 2001, shots were fired into the\nhouse of your ex-wife\u2019s attorney. You are considered a suspect in this case.\u201d\nAllegation 1.e now reads: \u201cOn or about . . . . ., 2002, your ex-wife\u2019s attorney was\nshot through his office window. You are considered a suspect in this case.\u201d\nAllegation 1.g now reads: \u201cOn or about . . . ., 2002, your ex-wife\u2019s attorney filed\nfor a Temporary Restraining Order against you in the [county courthouse in State].  On\nor about . . . . . , 2002, the court issued a Permanent Restraining Order against you.\u201d\nThe new SOR allegations are as follows:\nAllegation 1.l reads: \u201cOn or about . . . . ., 2000, the Court issued a Temporary\nRestraining Order against you prohibiting you from contacting your ex-wife\u2019s\ncommanding officer or other military officers or the press concerning issues surrounding\nthis case or any other matter collateral to the marriage.\u201d\nAllegation 1.m reads: \u201cOn or about . . . ., 2002, you or someone on your behalf\nwedged two pleadings signed by you and bearing your handwritten notes in the front\ndoor of the home of Judge #2,  who presided over your divorce hearings. On [ . . . ]\n4\n2002, Judge #2 recused himself from your divorce action.\u201d\nAllegation 1.n reads: \u201cOn or about . . . . , 2002, you called Judge #3 who presided\nover your divorce proceedings, at his home. On or about . . . ., 2002, Judge #3 issued\nan Order prohibiting you from directly or indirectly communicating with him other than in\nformal courtroom proceedings or pleadings.\u201d\n\nAs part of the custody evaluation in the divorce proceedings, both Applicant and his wife had to undergo a\n5\npsychological evaluation. GE 2 (Signed affidavit, 2000) at 1-2.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel correctly notes that allegation 1.k does not identify any specific conduct by Applicant.\n6\nSubsequent to my decision, the Appeal Board addressed the issue of whether failure to file tax returns and\n7\nthe financial issues related to unpaid taxes could be raised under Guideline F and as conduct under Guideline\nE, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16 (d). ISCR No. 06-20964 (App. BD. April 10, 2008). The Appeal Board held that the\nfailure to file a tax return is conduct which can be considered under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16 (d). The Appeal Board\ndecision is distinguishable from the facts in this case because allegation 1.k does not raise any conduct\nissues, only personality traits.\n4\nDenial of allegation 1.k and addition of Guideline I \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel sought to add the following allegation to the\nSOR under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 16(d):\n1.k: On or about . . . ., 2000, you underwent a psychological evaluation by\nDr. Smith, Psy.D [not actual name] as part of Parenting Time Evaluation\nordered by the Court in connection with your divorce proceedings. Dr.\nSmith\u2019s diagnostic impression was that you have an Axis I Adjustment\nDisorder with Mixed Emotional Features and Axis II Mixed Personality\nDisorder with traits of narcissism, perfectionism, and a tendency to\ndecompensate to regressive defenses or behaviors when experiencing\nstrong emotion.5\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel agreed that this allegation concerned\npsychological conditions and argued that the allegation was proper because it showed\nhow he responded to stress. (Tr. 23) AG \u00b6 16 (d) specifically states that any \u201dcredible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, which when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information . . .\u201d [emphasis supplied]. I denied this request on the\ngrounds that this new allegation raised issues properly raised under Guideline I\n(Psychological Conditions). Guideline I notes that a security concern may arise because\ncertain emotional, mental and personality conditions can impair judgment, reliability or\ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 27. Allegation 1.k specifically sets forth a diagnostic impression\nabout certain personality traits of Applicant, which could raise a security concern and\ndisqualify Applicant for a security clearance. This allegation, however, does not address\nany specific conduct by Applicant in response to stress or any type of conduct.  The\n6\nallegation specifically focuses on his personality traits.  See AG \u00b6 28(b). Given that\nGuideline I provides explicit coverage for this adverse information, it was improperly\nraised under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 16(d). Thus, the addition of allegation 1.k is denied.7\nApplicant\u2019s psychological evaluation is not pertinent to this decision and I have not\ndrawn any adverse inferences against Applicant based upon this evaluation.\n\nContrary to the implied argument in Applicant\u2019s brief, beyond a reasonable doubt is not the standard of proof\n8\nin a security clearance case.\n5\nIn light of my denial, Department Counsel sought to add a new Guideline I\nallegation. Due process requires that an Applicant be given fair notice of the allegations\nagainst him. To add a new guideline containing a new allegation which often requires\nadditional psychological evaluations and expert witness testimony violates Applicant\u2019s\nrights to fair notice and the opportunity to respond to the allegations against him. Thus,\nthe government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to add a Guideline I is denied.\nEvidentiary Issues and rulings \nCounsel for Applicant objected on hearsay grounds to testimony from the\nattorney-witness regarding statements by the attorney-witness that Applicant shot him,\nshot at his wife, and shot at Judge #1. I sustained this objection, but allowed the witness\nto testify regarding his opinion about who he considered responsible for the shootings.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 701, 801. (Federal Rules of Evidence do not control admissibility of\nevidence at security clearance hearings, but do provide persuasive guidance.)\nAt the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s case, Department Counsel sought to enter the\npsychological reports as rebuttal evidence. Applicant objected to the admission of this\nevidence. Following an in camera review, I denied the government\u2019s request to admit\nthe psychological reports as rebuttal character evidence. The reports do not address\nApplicant\u2019s credibility or his character. The reports review the results of a psychological\nevaluation conducted eight years ago. The reports identify personality traits and\npotential behavior resulting from these personality traits. Personality traits are not the\nsame as character. Thus, to allow these reports as rebuttal evidence would be highly\nprejudicial and confuse his personality traits with his character. Since these reports lack\nprobative value on the issue of Applicant\u2019s character and credibility, these reports are\ninappropriate rebuttal evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.\nI have reviewed the arguments of both parties regarding AE E, AE F, and AE G.8\nOn cross-examination, the attorney-witness acknowledge that at the same time he\nrepresented Applicant\u2019s wife, he represented a husband in another contentious and\nnotorious divorce proceeding. Otherwise, the attorney-witness had no recall about this\nnotorious case except that the wife had been arrested for kidnaping her son and for\nassault. AE E and AE F have no relevance to the case before me, except to show that\nthe attorney-witness represented the husband in this contentious and notorious case.\nLikewise, AE G has little relevance to the facts of this case, other than to show at least\none of the parties in the other case acted inappropriately and illegally in another\nsituation and may have a connection to the 2002 shooting of attorney-witness. AE E, AE\nF and AE G are admitted into evidence for the limited purposes just described. \n\nResponse to SOR, date February 26, 2007; Response to proposed amendment to SOR, dated November\n9\n12, 2007.\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SF-86)) at 1-2, 5, 8; Tr. 278, 335.\n10\nGE 1, supra note 10, at 3-4; GE 2, supra note 5, at 1-2.\n11\nGE 6 (State Court docket sheet for Applicant\u2019s divorce) at 6-7.\n12\nId.\n13\n6\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nspecific factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j of the SOR. He denied the underlying\nconduct implied in the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.l with explanations. For\nexample, he agreed that shots were fired into the house of attorney-witness. He,\nhowever, denied he did the shooting or that he is a suspect. As to the remaining\nallegations, he denied that the factual allegations are properly raised under Guideline E.\nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.   \n9\nApplicant is 47 years old and works as a systems engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He received a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1997\nand a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science earlier. He served on active duty in the\nUnited States Air Force for five years and for seven years in the Air Force Reserve at\nthe rank of Captain. He has held a security clearance since 1983, without any\nviolations.10\nApplicant married in 1986. His two daughters from this marriage are now 20 and\n15. He and his wife separated in 1999 after he learned about her infidelity.  Both\n11\nApplicant and his former wife obtained counsel in 1999. His former wife\u2019s first attorney\nwithdrew from representation on October 8, 1999. Applicant also changed attorneys\ntwice between October 1999 and February 2000.  \n12\nApplicant\u2019s former wife\u2019s second attorney testified on behalf of the government\nand will be identified as attorney-witness throughout this decision. Applicant and\nattorney-witness disliked each other. Between October 1999 and the summer of 2002,\nthe attorney-witness filed motions for contempt or restraining orders against Applicant.\nHe also filed criminal charges and made allegations of serious criminal misconduct.\nApplicant filed a grievance and numerous motions for sanctions against the attorney-\nwitness.  The actions taken by each during the divorce proceedings reflect the animosity\ntowards the other. The court issued a final divorce decree in May 2000, reserving\njurisdiction over issues of child custody and property, including real property and\nfinancial property.13\n\nId. at 3. Under state law, when a summons is attached to a petition for divorce and served, a mandatory\n14\nrestraining order automatically enters that prohibits either party from hiding, concealing, encumbering or\notherwise disposing of marital property without permission of the other party or order of court. State Code -\n1410-107. Tr. 50.\nGE 2, supra note 5, at 3-4; Tr. 50-54. A search of state law on marital property did not find any cases which\n15\nsupports this position of the attorney-witness on the status of the toys. Because they are minors, children\ncannot own toys. Thus, a court could view the children\u2019s toys as marital property or the parents as custodians\nof the toys for the children.\nGE 2, supra note 5, at 3-4; Tr. 237-241.\n16\nGE 2, supra note 5, at 3-4; GE 7 (Criminal complaint and dismissal notice) at 1-3; Tr. 50-54, 238-241, 244.\n17\n7\nOn October 19, 1999, the attorney-witness filed a Motion for Contempt.\nThereafter, the attorney-witness contacted Applicant\u2019s attorney demanding the return of\nmarital property Applicant had supposedly disposed of improperly.  The \u201cmarital\n14\nproperty\u201d consisted of children\u2019s outgrown toys, which Applicant had donated to his\ndaughters\u2019 school. Attorney-witness viewed the removal of the toys as a violation of the\nautomatic restraining order attached to the petition for divorce prohibiting the disposal of\nmarital property.  \n15\nIn February 2000, Applicant and his former wife sold their home. Just before\nclosing on the house, Applicant\u2019s attorney received a telephone call from attorney-\nwitness, demanding that the proceeds of the sale of the house be placed in an escrow\naccount, as it was marital property. If not, he would request the court to stop the sale of\nthe house.16\nApplicant proceeded to the office of attorney-witness to sign the escrow papers\nfor the proceeds from the sale of the house. He took with him the toys requested by\nattorney-witness. When he entered the office, attorney-witness became upset with the\ntoys and told Applicant to leave with the toys. Applicant left the office without the toys.\nHe returned 45 minutes later and retrieved the toys upon the advice of his attorney.\nDuring this interval, attorney-witness called the police. He then filed a criminal trespass\ncharge against Applicant. Within a few days of the filing, Applicant appeared at the\npolice station and signed for the summons on this charge. Five months later, the\nprosecutor dismissed the charges indicating that there was no prima facie case and no\nlikelihood of success at trial. Based on the decision of the prosecutor, I find that the\nattorney-witness had no basis for these allegations.  \n17\nIn April 2000, the court conducted a lengthy hearing on the October 1999\ncontempt citation and a Motion to Compel filed by Applicant. The court dismissed the\n1999 contempt motion, finding that Applicant had substantially complied with the\nrestraining order. The court also found in favor of Applicant on his motion to compel. In\nlight of the court\u2019s rulings, I find that Applicant substantially complied with the initial\n\nGE 6, supra note 12, at 3-5.\n18\nGE 8 (Letter); Tr. 61, 242. The state grievance authority\u2019s finding that the attorney-witness had grounds to\n19\nfile a criminal trespass charge is given little weight in light of the prosecutor\u2019s decision.\nGE 6, supra note 12.\n20\nId.; Tr. 267-268.\n21\nTr. 65-66, 218-226, 245-245.\n22\n8\nrestraining order. By filing the contempt motion and the criminal trespass charge, the\nattorney-witness sought to gain an advantage in the divorce case.18\nIn the summer of 2000, acting upon his understanding from talks with his\nattorney and based on the criminal charges, Applicant filed a grievance against the\nattorney-witness with the state attorney grievance authority, which is the legally\nappropriate venue. Applicant continued to raise additional issues during the processing\nof this grievance. The state grievance authority ultimately concluded that attorney-\nwitness had not violated the state\u2019s legal ethical rules.   \n19\nDuring this same period of time, while represented by counsel, Applicant filed\nnumerous motions for sanctions in his divorce proceedings, alleging unethical conduct\nby the attorney-witness. The court dismissed all his motions. In November 2000, the\ncourt allowed Applicant\u2019s then counsel to withdraw as his representative and Applicant\nto represent himself. Thereafter, Applicant re-filed his motions for sanctions as allowed\nby the court. The court again dismissed all his motions. In filing these motions, Applicant\nviolated no rules or laws; rather, he used a legitimate legal process to raise his\ncomplaints about the attorney-witness.20\n \nIn late 2000, the court issued a restraining order against Applicant. The order\ndirected that he not contact his former wife\u2019s commanding officer or any other military\nofficers regarding issues or matters collateral to their marriage. The record contains no\nevidence Applicant violated this Order. The court docket sheet does not show a motion\nfor contempt alleging violation of this restraining order has been filed. I find that\nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he has complied with this order credible.  \n21\nIn the summer of 2001, an unknown person fired a bullet through the dining room\nwindow of attorney-witness\u2019s home. At the time, his wife was sitting in the room. She\nwas not injured. Although the attorney-witness believes that Applicant is the shooter, the\npolice have never arrested or charged Applicant or anyone else with this shooting.\nApplicant denies any involvement in this shooting. The detective testifying at the hearing\ndid not provide any information on this incident. There is no evidence of record which\nindicates that Applicant committed this crime or was in any way responsible for this\nshooting.22\n\nJoint Exhibit 1 (Order).\n23\nGE 6, supra note 12, at 32; GE 14 (Petition for Temporary Restraining Order in 2002) at 1; Tr. 81, 161, 218-\n24\n226, 246.\nTr. 148.\n25\nBased on information from his criminal attorney, Applicant understands that the district attorney does not\n26\nconsider him a suspect in this shooting as there is insufficient evidence to meet a probable cause standard.\nTr. 297-300.\n9\nJudge #1 issued an Order in the summer of 2001, restricting Applicant\u2019s ability to\nfile future motions in his divorce case. Based on Applicant\u2019s numerous motions,\nobjections and petitions, Judge #1 ordered Applicant to obtain leave of court to file a\nmotion. Judge #1 also instructed that the motion must be related to the welfare of\nApplicant\u2019s minor children. Judge #1 restricted Applicant\u2019s ability to continue filing\nfrivolous motions. He did not prohibit Applicant from filing necessary motions.  \n23\nIn the fall of 2001, Judge #1 recused himself from Applicant\u2019s divorce case. The\ndocket sheet contains no information as to why the judge recused himself. The SOR\nalleges that the recusal came after an unidentified person shot at Judge #1's home prior\nto his recusal. The director of court security confirmed that an incident occurred at\nJudge #1's home. The record contains no additional documentation or testimony which\nexplains the reasons for Judge #1's recusal from Applicant\u2019s divorce case. I decline to\nfind that Judge #1 recused himself from Applicant\u2019s divorce case on the grounds\nApplicant shot at Judge #1 as there is simply no evidence that Applicant is responsible\nfor this shooting. The police did not interview Applicant and do not consider him a\nsuspect in this case, although the director of court security does. No formal charges\nhave ever been brought against Applicant regarding this incident and he denies he had\nany responsibility for this incident.  \n24\nShortly after he recused himself from Applicant\u2019s divorce case, Judge #1 gave a\nverbal directive to the then director of court security that Applicant was to be escorted\nwhile in the courthouse. Judge #1 did not conduct any formal hearings nor did he issue\na restraining order directing that Applicant was to be escorted when in the courthouse.\nCourt security and the sheriff\u2019s office clearly understood that Applicant was to be\nescorted while in the courthouse. However, the record contains no evidence that\nApplicant was told about Judge #1's verbal directive. Applicant learned through a friend\nthat his picture had been posted in the courthouse shortly after Judge #1 gave the oral\ndirective.25\nIn early 2002, a sniper shot the attorney-witness in the head while he sat in his\noffice chair. He did not see who shot him. The police investigated this shooting and\nhave not arrested anyone. The police, however, still consider Applicant a suspect based\nsolely on the opinion of the attorney-witness that Applicant shot him.  The investigating\n26\ndetective provided no other basis for suspecting Applicant. At the hearing, Applicant\nacknowledged that he should have been a suspect, but denies that he shot the attorney\n\nGE 4 (Applicant\u2019s 2004 signed statement) at 2; GE 14, supra note 24, at 1; Tr. 91-96,  218-221, 225, 246-\n27\n248. A few days prior to the 2002 shooting, the attorney-witness deposed the wife of a client in another\ncontentious case. In August 2002, this woman, who is a paranoid schizophrenic, was arrested for kidnaping,\nassault and battery after she hired three men to kidnap her son from the residence of an ex-husband, the\nfather of the son. Her ex-husband was beaten by these men. All the individuals involved, except the former\nhusband and child, are in jail serving the sentences imposed by a court. The attorney-witness never\nmentioned this woman to the police. AE G, supra note 3; Tr. 137-139, 221. \nGE 12 (2002 Order); Tr. 268-269.\n28\n10\nwitness. The attorney-witness believes Applicant shot him because Applicant filed a\ngrievance against him and filed motions for sanctions against him.27\nIn the spring of 2002, Judge #2 found wedged in the front door of his residence\ntwo pleadings signed by Applicant, which Judge #2 believed Applicant or his\nrepresentative delivered. Applicant acknowledges that he put these documents in Judge\n#2's front door. Judge #2 viewed the action as an act of trespass and attempt at an ex-\nparte communication with him by Applicant, in violation of Judge #2's previous\ninstructions to file all papers related to the divorce proceeding at the courthouse. Judge\n#2 reported Applicant\u2019s action to the police because he was the subject of an\ninvestigation for criminal activity (the shooting of attorney-witness). Judge #2 recused\nhimself from Applicant\u2019s divorce case in an Order issued the next day.28\nOn a Friday in the summer of 2002, the attorney-witness filed a \u201cverified\ncomplaint for restraining order\u201d against Applicant, stating that Applicant was in the alley\nbehind his office. The attorney-witness noted the 2000 restraining order against\ncontacting Applicant\u2019s former wife\u2019s supervisors and listed the following past incidents of\nviolence or threats in the sworn complaint:     \n1)\n[. . . ] trespass at his office [without noting that the district attorney found\nthis criminal allegation baseless].\n2)\n[ . . . ] shot at my wife. \n3)\n[ . . . ] shot at Judge #1.\n4)\n[ . . . ] shot me in the head.\n5) \nThreatened Judge #2 in 2002.  \n6)\nJune 6 received letter threatening my office staff.\nAs previously noted, there is insufficient evidence in this record that Applicant\nshot the attorney-witness or to warrant an arrest or trial. Likewise, there is insufficient\nevidence Applicant shot at the attorney-witness\u2019s his wife or Judge #1. The police do\nnot consider Applicant a suspect in these shootings. The statements of the attorney-\nwitness in this complaint do not reflect that he witnessed two of the shootings and that\n\nGE 14, supra note 24, at 1, 3; Tr. 136, 140-142.\n29\nDuring the custody issue battles, Applicant obtained an Order from the court, which would not allow\n30\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife to remove their minor children from the state, even if her job transferred her.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he challenged this Order because Judge #1's Order of  2001 did not\n31\nprevent him from filing any pleadings in the file.\nI note that the court docket sheet contains a reference to an affidavit for citation for contempt of court filed\n32\non July 2001, which is after the order limiting Applicant\u2019s ability to file motions. Applicant filed an objection on\nJuly 2001. The docket sheet also reflects certain contempt motions had been filed in early June. GE 6, supra\nnote 12, at 28-44; GE 16 (Order); Tr. 269-271.\nGE 13 (Petition for Removal, 2002); Tr. 136, 140-142.\n33\n11\nhe saw who shot him. He did not provide testimony about a threat to Judge #2 nor is\nthere any evidence of such a threat in the record. The attorney-witness alleged fear of\nharm by Applicant when he filled out this complaint even though the first four events\noccurred between five and 16 months prior to the filing of the complaint. The letter to his\nstaff, if one exists, was not attached to the complaint and is not of record. The court\nissued a temporary restraining order the same day, ordering Applicant to have no\ncontact with the plaintiffs, to stay away from certain places, and be escorted for court\nappearances involving the attorney-witness.  The next Monday, the attorney-witness\n29\nfiled a Petition for Removal of the minor children on behalf of his client, Applicant\u2019s\nformer wife.30\n \nIn the summer of 2002, Judge #3 issued an Order prohibiting Applicant from\ncontacting or directly or indirectly communicating with him other than in formal\ncourtroom proceedings, following Applicant\u2019s telephone call to Judge #3 at home three\ndays earlier. In his response to the SOR, Applicant attached a document showing that\nhe also faxed documents to Judge #3 around the time of the telephone call. Applicant\nacknowledged this conduct at the hearing. In the same Order, Judge #3 struck all filings\nfrom the record because Applicant had violated the summer of 2001 Order.  From the\n31\ndocket sheet, I am unable to determine the basis for Judge #3's ruling. Judge #3 also\nindicated he was going to issue a separate contempt order, but such an Order is not\nlisted in the docket sheet.    \n32\nWithout deciding the underlying issues, the court entered a permanent\nrestraining order in September 2002, which given the animosity between Applicant and\nthe attorney-witness was a proper exercise of judicial authority to prohibit future\nproblems between the two. There is no evidence Applicant violated this order. The\nattorney-witness\u2019s vague and generalized statement, without concrete evidence that\nApplicant violated this order or others, does not constitute reliable evidence of a\nviolation.  \n33\nIn early September 2005, Applicant entered the local courthouse to file papers.\nHe walked through the security procedures, then to the clerk\u2019s office. He filed his papers\nthen delivered a copy of the papers to an office in the building. Thereafter, he\n\nGE 17 (Sheriff\u2019s office report of September 2005 incident); AE A (video-tape); Tr 187-194, 259-262.\n34\nGE 17, supra note 34; GE 18 (Restraining Order, September 2005); Tr. 189-194, 263. \n35\nTr. 184-187, 215.\n36\n12\nproceeded to leave the building. While delivering the papers, a staff person observed\nApplicant in the hallway. Just after Applicant deposited his papers outside the office and\nreturned down the hall, a sheriff deputy exited a nearby room. The staffer spoke to the\ndeputy and both reviewed the papers delivered by Applicant. At this time, the deputy\nbegan to follow the Applicant as he left the building. The deputy\u2019s supervisor testified\nthat as Applicant was preparing to exit the building, the deputy asked Applicant his\nname and Applicant did not respond. The supervisor considered this resisting. The CD\nvideo-tape, without audio, provided by Applicant, which showed his actions during his\nstay in the courthouse, reveals that as Applicant walked by the security gate, the deputy\nwas following him. Applicant stopped and spoke to the deputy a few steps from the exit\ndoor. The video-tape does not show any misconduct towards the deputy at this point.\nThe video-tape only shows the lower body and feet of Applicant and the deputy as\nApplicant stepped out the door. As Applicant attempts to exit the courthouse, the deputy\npulled Applicant back into the building. What happened as Applicant started to go out\nthe door and for the three minutes sheriff deputies talked with him is not visible on the\nvideo-tape. The deputy\u2019s supervisor testified that Applicant took quick steps towards the\ndeputy who put his hands up. Applicant took another step and a quick step towards\nanother deputy. The deputies considered these moves as acts of aggression and\ndetained Applicant. The video-tape does not show any of these moves by Applicant.\nThe video-tape reflects that three minutes after Applicant attempted to exit the\ncourthouse, the deputies had handcuffed him and were walking him to the security\noffice. Applicant sat in the security office handcuffed for 12 minutes, ignored by the\ndeputies. The officers then escorted him out of the building.34\nApplicant returned to the courthouse to file a complaint with Internal Affairs about\nhis treatment by the sheriff\u2019s deputies two days earlier. Applicant met with the\nsupervisor (who testified at the hearing). The supervisor took Applicant\u2019s complaint and\ninvestigated the incident. He found no wrongdoing by his deputies after talking with\nthem and reviewing their reports. As Applicant left the courthouse that day, the\nsupervisor handed Applicant a restraining order signed by Judge #1. Applicant\nacknowledged receiving this restraining order, which prohibits him from entering the\ncourthouse unless escorted.   \n35\nThe court services supervisor, who is responsible for the sheriff deputies\nassigned to the courthouse, testified that his office co-exists with the county security\noffice, which oversees the security at all county buildings. The supervisor advised that a\nsheriff would escort Applicant when called by the security office. His office acted as\nbackup for escorting the Applicant when the security office needed assistance. He had\nno recollection of any encounter with the Applicant in the courthouse between October\n2001 and September 2005.36\n\nId. at 172, 178-179, 195-196.\n37\nGE 3 (Signed affidavit, 2004) at 5. In 1999, his wife called the police, alleging that he was beating her. He\n38\nleft the house and drove to the home of a friend, a police officer. His friend called his house and found out that\nthe investigating police did not believe her. No charges were ever filed. GE 2, supra note 5, at 5. The attorney-\nwitness attempted to testify about supposed acts of violence by Applicant. Given that the SOR contained no\nallegations of domestic violence, I granted Applicant\u2019s objection to this unsupported testimony.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he made his former wife an offer to resolve the attorney fee issue,\n39\nwhich she rejected. He then testified that he had given up his right to any retirement benefit in the future, but\nhe has not provided the documentation which supports this testimony. Tr. 230, 250 He has provided\ndocumentation which reflects that the government stopped its payments to him in October 2007, pending a\nfinal computation of his benefit. AE E, supra note 3. No other evidence has been submitted.\nResponse to SOR, February 26, 2007, at 2-3; GE 6, supra note 12, at 40; Tr. 219, 225-226, 298-299.\n40\n13\nThe director of county security acknowledged that when Applicant was in the\ncourthouse, he never exhibited any threatening behavior. He also acknowledged that he\ndid not see any aggression on the video-tape, which is part of the evidence. Following\nthe issuance of the restraining order in September 2005, the director recalled one time\nwhen Applicant entered the courthouse and failed to obtain an escort. When he pressed\nfor enforcement of the restraining order, Judge #1 declined.37\nThe record contains no evidence of any criminal charges filed against Applicant\nprior to or after the criminal trespass charge. Applicant acknowledged he had been\ncharged with criminal misconduct as a juvenile. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s\nformer wife ever filed domestic violence charges against him.38\nThe court awarded Applicant\u2019s former wife over $30,000 in attorney fees on\nFebruary 26, 2002. Applicant appealed. The appellate court affirmed the fee award on\nJune 13, 2003. Applicant declined to pay his wife the attorney fees for several years. As\npart of the property distribution in his divorce, the State court awarded Applicant a\npercentage of his former wife\u2019s military retirement benefit. In the fall of 2007, his former\nwife requested the court to review this award. Recently, he agreed to forego his $1,150\na month payment from his wife\u2019s retirement benefit to pay these fees. It is unclear\nwhether he has given up his right to this benefit forever or until these fees are paid.39\nDuring the criminal investigation of the shooting of attorney-witness, the police\nsearched Applicant\u2019s home after obtaining a search warrant in criminal court. The police\nseized 29 items from his home, including a number of guns. The police ran a ballistic\ntest on two guns, which were found not to be the caliber of the gun used in the shooting\nof the attorney-witness. Based on this information I find that the remaining guns not\ntested were not the caliber of the weapon used in the shooting. In addition, because the\npolice filed no criminal charges against the Applicant, I find that all the seized guns were\nproperly registered to Applicant, a gun collector. The police eventually returned the\nseized guns to Applicant.40\n\nGE 15 (Employee notice performance, dated July 29, 2005) at 1; Tr. 254-258, 311-314, 346-348.\n41\nId. 327-330, 334-335, 338-341, 348-350.\n42\nTr. 248-249, 266, 269-272, 319-320.\n43\n14\nApplicant worked with a female co-worker, whom he described as difficult and\nless than competent. At the hearing, another co-worker testified to the same view of this\nparticular female co-worker. Because of problems with the female co-worker,\nmanagement requested Applicant to avoid all direct and indirect contact with her. He\ncomplied with this request, until she left him a threatening voice-mail message on July\n28, 2005. Applicant asked a co-worker to listen to the voice-mail. The co-worker agreed\nwith Applicant\u2019s view of the message. Applicant prepared an e\u2013mail response, which his\nco-worker reviewed. His co-worker agreed the response was appropriate. Management\ndid not agree and issued Applicant a notice of discipline. Applicant responded to the\ndiscipline by finding another job in another area of the company.41\nTwo co-workers and two friends testified on his behalf.  All recommend him for a\nclearance. Two testified that they never heard him express any anger or animosity\nagainst any judges or the attorney-witness, and one witness indicated Applicant never\nexpressed any desire to punish or for vengeance against the female co-worker who\ncaused him problems. One long-time friend was aware that he was a suspect in the\nshooting of the attorney-witness. He was confident that Applicant did not shoot the\nattorney-witness. Two witnesses describe a very good relationship with his children.42\nApplicant admits that he did things in his divorce which were wrong. He\nunderstands now that some of his behavior and actions were \u201ccrazy\u201d as he was always\non the defensive. He is afraid to go into the courthouse and avoids entering the\ncourthouse. He does not want to be arrested and go to jail. His friends file his court\npapers. He likes his current job and is good at it. He also acknowledges that it was\nwrong to call Judge #3 in 2002. He did not understand the impropriety of his conduct at\nthat time. He thought he needed to be pro-active in solving the child custody issue.43\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n15\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe government seeks to deny Applicant his security clearance based on his\npersonal conduct during his divorce proceedings. Under Guideline E, a security concern\npertaining to personal conduct arises when:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n16\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. See AG \u00b6 15 \nThe government argues that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct raises a security\nconcern under the following disqualifying conditions:\nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other\nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered\nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This\nincludes but is not limited to consideration of:\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations\nTo establish its case under this guideline, the government must show that\nApplicant was the actor in the alleged conduct. The government established that the\npolice charged and arrested Applicant for third degree criminal trespass in early 2000.\n(SOR \u00b61.a) Applicant\u2019s arrest occurred, not because he decided to illegally enter the\noffice of the attorney-witness, but because in response to a demand from the attorney-\nwitness, he appeared at the office of the attorney-witness to sign documents creating an\nescrow account. When he arrived, Applicant had also brought with him children\u2019s toys,\nwhich the attorney-witness had demanded be returned. The attorney-witness became\nvery upset about the toys and called the police, alleging criminal trespass when\nApplicant did not remove the toys. Five months later, the prosecutor dismissed the\ncharges against Applicant because he could not prove the elements of a prima facie\ncase of criminal trespass and had no hope of succeeding at trial on the charges. In light\nof the prosecutor\u2019s decision, Applicant did not violate any rules of law or society. He\nappeared at the attorney-witness\u2019s office at the direction of his own counsel and the\nrequest of the attorney-witness. The implied criminal conduct and rules violation in this\nallegation are not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3). Even is the allegation is\nestablished, Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under AG \u00b6 17(f)\nbecause the government has not substantiated that the Applicant violated any rules.\nUnder SOR \u00b61.b, the government has established that in the fall of 2001,\nsomeone fired shots into Judge #1's home, and that subsequent to this incident Judge\n\n17\n#1 recused himself from Applicant\u2019s divorce case. The only evidence of record which\nindicates that Applicant may have been the shooter is the unsupported opinion of the\nDirector of Security Services. Given that there is no direct, circumstantial or forensic\nevidence substantiating this opinion, I find Director of Security Services\u2019s opinion\ninsufficient to establish Applicant\u2019s culpability. Because of the lack of any evidence that\nApplicant was involved in this shooting and in an exercise of my discretion, I decline to\ninfer that Applicant is responsible for this shooting. The government has not established\nthe criminal conduct implied in this allegation under AG \u00b6 16(c) and (d)(3), and thus, a\nviolation of the rules of society. Should these facts be deemed sufficient to establish this\nallegation, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under AG \u00b6 17(f) because the\ngovernment has not substantiated that Applicant fired shots at Judge #1.\nIn the summer of 2001, someone fired a shot through the dining room window of\nthe attorney-witness\u2019s home. Although the police interviewed Applicant about this\nincident, the record contains no evidence that the police consider Applicant a suspect in\nthis shooting. The police detective, who testified at the hearing, never mentioned that\nApplicant was a suspect in this incident. The attorney-witness believes that Applicant is\nresponsible for this shooting, but no one saw Applicant commit this crime. I decline to\ninfer misconduct on the part of Applicant based on the unsupported belief of the\nattorney-witness. Although the government has established that this shooting took\nplace, it has not established that Applicant is the shooter in SOR \u00b61.c., and thus, its\ncase under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3). See also AG \u00b6 17(f).\nLikewise, the government has not established the implication that Applicant shot\nthe attorney-witness, although it has established the fact that the attorney-witness was\nshot and Applicant is a suspect. (SOR \u00b61.e) The attorney-witness sustained a serious\nhead injury in early 2002 when an unidentified individual shot him while he was sitting in\nhis office. He did not see the shooter. Subsequent to the shooting, the police\ninterviewed Applicant and confiscated a number of guns from his house pursuant to a\nsearch warrant. The police submitted only two guns for ballistic testing, which indicates\nthat the remaining guns were not the correct caliber. The two guns tested did not match\nthe bullet used in the shooting. In the six and one-half years since this incident, the\npolice have not arrested anyone for this shooting. The police still consider the Applicant\na suspect based solely on the unsupported opinion of the attorney-witness, who\nbelieves that Applicant shot him. The attorney-witness reached this conclusion by\nreasoning that when Applicant failed to succeed through legal methods, such as the\nfiling of a grievance and motions for sanctions to inflict harm on the attorney-witness\u2019s\ncareer, he resorted to the use of a gun, even though Applicant had no prior history of\ncriminal conduct outside of the Attorney-witness\u2019s baseless allegation of criminal\ntrespass. Allegations of misconduct require more than speculation, insinuation, and\ninnuendo. Although the facts alleged are proven, the underlying inference that Applicant\nshot the attorney-witness is not. This allegation is found in favor of Applicant because\nthe allegation is unsubstantiated under AG \u00b6 17(f).\nThe court directed Applicant to pay his former wife more than $30,000 in attorney\nfees connected with their divorce. Applicant appealed this award. The appellate court\n\nThe assertion of a threatening letter in the summer of 2002 is not supported by any documentation.\n44\n18\naffirmed the $30,000 fee award. Applicant has not paid his former wife this money. Until\nrecently, Applicant has made no effort to pay this award because he had no intent to\npay the fees. Under state law, the court awarded Applicant a percentage of his former\nwife\u2019s military retirement. Following his former wife\u2019s request to the court to review this\naward, Applicant agreed to forego his spousal benefit until the attorney fee award and\njudgment is paid. Payment of this debt resulted from actions taken by his former wife to\nforce him to pay this judgment, not actions of the Applicant. The government has\nestablished its case under SOR \u00b61.f.\nThe government established that the state court issued a temporary restraining\norder against Applicant in the summer of 2002 and a permanent restraining order\nagainst Applicant a few months later. Both orders directed him to stay away from the\nattorney-witness and his family members. The record contains no reliable evidence that\nApplicant violated this Order. The attorney-witness\u2019s gratuitous statements that\nApplicant violated this order are considered unreliable given the absence of direct\nevidence of any violation. In issuing these orders, the court made no findings on the\nvalidity of the underlying facts, all of which are unproven. More troublesome is the fact\nthat when filing for the initial temporary restraining order, the attorney-witness listed six\nfactual allegations as if each allegation was a proven fact, when none of the allegations\nare proven. The attorney-witness failed to convince me that he filed for a restraining\norder because he feared harm from the Applicant. He waited nearly five months after he\nwas shot to file for a restraining order against Applicant. This is a long time to wait if one\nfears injury from another person, particularly if he believes the person shot him. Four\nother cited events occurred even further back in time.  He filed for this restraining order\n44\none work day before he filed a petition on behalf of Applicant\u2019s former wife to remove\ntheir children from the state. The attorney-witness\u2019s decision to file for this restraining\norder came not out of fear, but to gain an advantage in the latest custody issues in the\nApplicant\u2019s divorce. The government has established that the court issued the\nrestraining orders set forth in SOR \u00b61.g.\nApplicant received an Employee Performance Notice on July 29, 2005 because\nhe failed to follow his manager\u2019s direction not to communicate with a female co-worker.\nHe received a threatening telephone call from this co-worker and responded by e-mail\nasking her not to make any threats to him. The government has established the\nallegation in SOR \u00b61.h.\nAs to SOR \u00b61.i, the government has established the facts alleged. However, this\nentire situation raises concerns because throughout his entire time in the courthouse,\nApplicant acted appropriately. He did nothing out of the ordinary. As he attempted to\nleave the courthouse, for reasons which are unclear, a sheriff\u2019s deputy decided to detain\nhim to determine his name. The need for this information as Applicant is leaving the\nbuilding is puzzling. The deputies contend that Applicant exhibited aggressive behavior\n\nThe sheriff deputies provided the video clips in evidence to Applicant. If other incriminating evidence exists,\n45\nthe Sheriff\u2019s deputies did not produce it.\n19\ntowards them, but no such behavior is shown on the video-clips of record.  The\n45\nhearsay testimony of the supervisor as well as the written reports are given little weight.\nAlthough the deputies handcuffed him and took him to their office, where they detained\nhim for a period of time, they did not arrest or charge him with any misconduct. In fact,\nthey ignored him. I find that the government has not established any misconduct by the\nApplicant in September 2005.\nTwo days after the above incident, the court issued another restraining order\nagainst Applicant because of supposed threatening behavior, which required him to be\nescorted anytime he was in the courthouse. On at least one occasion subsequent to the\nreceipt of the restraining order, Applicant failed to notify security that he was in the\ncourthouse and would wait for his escort. The government has established SOR \u00b61.j.\nThe court issued its first restraining order against Applicant in late 2000, which\nprohibited Applicant from contacting his former wife\u2019s commanding officer or other\nmilitary officers or the press, facts which the government has established under SOR\n\u00b61.l.\nApplicant acknowledges that he left court pleadings related to his divorce\nproceedings at the home of Judge #2. As a result, Judge #2 recused himself from\nApplicant\u2019s divorce case. The government has established the conduct in SOR \u00b61.m.\nIn addition, the government established that in August 2002, Applicant called\nJudge #3 at his home, in violation of previously established procedures for conducting\nApplicant\u2019s divorce case. Three days later, Judge #3 issued an order prohibiting\nApplicant from directly or indirectly communicating with him other than in formal\ncourtroom proceedings or pleadings. I find SOR \u00b61.n. is established.\nIn light of my findings under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l., 1.m, and 1.n, I will\nconsider if Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns. Under AG \u00b6 17,\nsecurity concerns may be mitigated by:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n\n20\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nMost of the incidents raised in the SOR occurred during Applicant\u2019s divorce.\nThere is no question that serious issues arose in Applicant\u2019s divorce. Some of the\nissues directly relate to Applicant\u2019s conduct during the course of his divorce; however,\nmany of the issues are not directly related to him or established as his conduct. \nThe court issued three restraining orders against Applicant. There is evidence of\nonly one violation of these restraining orders. Because his wife retired from the military,\nthere is little likelihood that he will contact her military superiors in the future, and since\nhe did not violate this restraining order in the past, he is not likely to do so in the future.\nHe has mitigated the security concerns as to allegation 1.l. Applicant has shown that he\ndid not violate the rules, and has, thus, mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) and (f).\nThe restraining order against the attorney-witness and his family remains in\neffect. There is no evidence Applicant has violated this restraining order. Since\nApplicant has complied with the conditions of the restraining order, the government has\nnot substantiated its claim that Applicant violated the rules. He has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns as to allegation 1.g under AG \u00b6 17(f).\nApplicant violated the September 2005 restraining order on one occasion. Given\nthat Judge #1 refused to enforce an alleged violation of the September 2005 restraining\norder and the director of security testified that he is no longer requiring Applicant to be\nescorted when in the courthouse, I find that this restraining order is no longer in effect,\nand thus, the potential for a future violation is nonexistent. However, a concern\ncontinues about Applicant\u2019s judgment because he failed to comply with the terms of the\nrestraining order. In so doing, he showed a willingness to ignore court orders. He has\nnot mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to allegation 1.j.\nAlthough Applicant has little direct contact with his former wife, who is not\nrepresented by the attorney-witness anymore, and there is little likelihood that he will\nhave contact with either in the future, his attitude towards the payment of the court\nordered fees has not changed. He does not want to pay the fees, but has been forced\nby his former wife to do so. His continuous refusal to comply with the court order reflects\npoor judgment. He has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to\nallegation 1.f.\nApplicant, however, has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his\nonly on-the-job disciplinary action. He changed jobs to avoid any further problems with\nthe female co-worker. This decision indicates an exercise of good judgment in his\nemployment. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about SOR \u00b61.h.\n\n21\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with Judge #2 and Judge #3 outside of the courthouse\nshows a lack of judgment and a failure on his part to make sure, as a pro se litigant, he\nunderstood and followed the conduct rules inherent in all court systems. His conduct\nalso raises a concern about judicial intimidation. Throughout his divorce proceedings,\nApplicant\u2019s emotions drove his decision making. He failed to listen to his attorneys and\nto always follow the orders of the court. His conduct reflects poor judgment. He has not\nmitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his judgment. After considering his conduct\nand the above conditions for mitigation, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b61.f, 1.j, 1.m, and 1.n.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The issues in this case began when\nApplicant\u2019s former wife retained the attorney-witness to represent her in their divorce.\nThe attorney-witness immediately filed a motion for contempt with the court and created\nan issue over $80 worth of children\u2019s toys. When Applicant returned the toys as\ndemanded, the attorney-witness filed a criminal trespass charge, which changed\nApplicant\u2019s and his former wife\u2019s approach to their divorce. The prosecutor dismissed\nthe charges because he could not prove a prima facie case of any wrongdoing by\nApplicant.\nDuring the course of his divorce proceedings, Applicant responded to the criminal\ncharges by filing an allegation of ethical violations against the attorney-witness. At the\nsame time and despite having legal counsel, he personally filed numerous motions for\nsanctions against the attorney-witness with the court. While legal, Applicant\u2019s actions\noffended the attorney-witness and led to a very intense dislike of each other. The\nrelationship between these two individuals can still be characterized as adversarial.\n\n22\nThe allegations that Applicant shot at two individuals and shot the attorney-\nwitness are serious. However, the record lacks direct, circumstantial or forensic\nevidence that Applicant is responsible for these incidents. Under the United States\nConstitution and the criminal law system, mere speculation, innuendo, and suspicion\nare insufficient to prosecute any individual for a crime. An individual is innocent until\nproven guilty by the state after a trial by a jury of peers, a right guaranteed by the Sixth\nAmendment to the Constitution. Imbedded in this precept is the Sixth Amendment\nConstitutional Right to confront one\u2019s accusers. Applicant has not been arrested as the\npolice lack any probable cause, meaning any relevant evidence, to arrest him for these\nincidents. He has not been tried by a jury of his peers and convicted. The opinion of the\nattorney-witness is insufficient to establish that Applicant committed these crimes. His\nopinion is based on the adversarial nature of his relationship with Applicant during the\ntime he represented Applicant\u2019s former wife. I decline to find that Applicant committed\nthe criminal conduct inferred in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e.\nThe first restraining order resulted from Applicant\u2019s conduct during the course of\nhis divorce proceedings. While the underpinnings to the second restraining order have\nnever been proven, Applicant\u2019s conduct in the court proceedings and his adversarial\nrelationship with the attorney-witness contributed to the decision of the court to enter a\npermanent restraining order against him. The video-tape evidence fails to show any\naggressive behavior by the Applicant while in the courthouse in September 2005. Even\nso, the sheriff\u2019s office sought the third restraining order, based on their claims of\nthreatening conduct by Applicant. The court granted the order, in part it appears,\nbecause of past behavior in the courthouse. Given that lack of enforcement of this\nrestraining order following an allegation that Applicant violated and the decision of the\nsecurity director not to require an escort for Applicant, I find that this Order is no longer\nbeing enforced. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he has complied with the restraining orders,\nexcept on one occasion.\nThe antagonistic relationship between Applicant and the attorney-witness still\nexists. There is no evidence that Applicant has obtained any counseling to train him on\nhow to handle similar situations in the future.\nApplicant readily admits that his conduct during the course of his divorce\nproceedings was at times \u201ccrazy\u201d and that he did things that were wrong. An overall\nview of his conduct during the period covering 1999 through 2005 shows that Applicant\nbehaved improperly on many occasions during his divorce. He responded negatively\nand without much thought to the events taking place around him. At times, the behavior\nof the attorney-witness spurred Applicant to make inappropriate decisions without\nthinking or listening to his attorneys or using common sense. He contacted two judges\noutside of the courtroom in violation of specific instructions on how to proceed in court.\nHe steadfastly refused to pay his wife the attorney fees owed, until she took action to\nobtain payment. In this time of extreme emotional stress, Applicant showed a lack of\ngood judgement on many occasions. In a security clearance case, such actions reveal\nsomething about how a person may act in the future when under great stress. Although\nnot an accurate predictor of future behavior in all situations, Applicant\u2019s behavior during\n\n23\nthis period of time raises concerns about how he will act in the future if he is again\nunder extreme emotional stress.\nDuring his long and contentious divorce proceedings, Applicant held a security\nclearance and never violated security procedures, a fact I must consider, but is not\nconclusive as to future actions. Since Applicant has demonstrated that he does not think\nclearly when under extreme stress, the security concern arises as to how Applicant may\nrespond if pressured or coerced by those seeking classified information and he is under\nextreme stress. Having reviewed all the evidence as a whole, my findings against the\ngovernment on many issues, and my findings against Applicant, I find that Applicant has\nnot mitigated the government\u2019s concern that his past conduct and poor judgment in a\nhighly stressful situation will not reoccur if highly stressed again. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nDenied \nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n24\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 23 year old engineer with a major defense contractor, successfully mitigated\n\n2\nsecurity concerns for marijuana use during college by demonstrating an intent not to use again and\nseparating himself from his college associates with whom he used. An allegation of use while\nholding a security clearance was rebutted by a factual showing his last use occurred four months\nprior to his employment. Clearance is granted.  \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn December 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMarch 2, 2007, and a hearing was held on March 22, 2007. Four government exhibits and three\napplicant exhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant, and one witness testified on his behalf.\nThe transcript was received on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations relating to use of marijuana but denied that he had\nused marijuana while holding an interim security clearance. After a complete review of the record,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor employed as an electrical design\nengineer since July 17, 2006. He had worked in a cooperative program at the same company while\na student through a his university sponsored program for two periods of three months each in 2005\nand 2006. The second and last employment while a student concluded in February 2006 (Exh. A).\nHe applied for a security clearance on a SF 86 on February 23, 2006 on which he acknowledged use\nof marijuana. The last use was in April 2006 just before his graduation (Tr. 15). He elaborated on\nthe frequency of use in his statement to an investigator saying he had used marijuana approximately\nforty times over a five year period while in college. During the time he worked with the cooperative\nprogram for his company he did not use marijuana (Tr. 15 and Exh. 2). Applicant has a Bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering and applied communications granted in May 2006.\nApplicant owns his own home which he has been restoring since January 2007. He is single\nwith an annual salary is $57,000. He is regarded as a dedicated and highly regarded employee by his\nsupervisor (Exh. B). \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was with his college friends whom he no longer sees and he no\nlonger associates with people who use drugs. His company does random drug testing. He does not\nintend to use illegal drugs in the future. His statement on that intent to the investigator was somewhat\nequivocal but he clarified it at the hearing to my satisfaction and the investigator and department\ncounsel who both agreed with the clarification as no longer equivocal (Tr. 57-58). \nThe government conceded at the hearing that Applicant did not use drugs while holding a\nsecurity clearance and that a finding on the allegation should be in his favor (Tr. 57).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. Applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe government has cited drug involvement under Guideline H as a security concern in the\nproposed denial of a security clearance for the Applicant. Drug involvement is always a security\nconcern because it raises questions about a person\u2019s willingness or ability to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations (AG \u00b624). Any drug abuse is a condition that may be disqualifying (AG \u00b6 25 a).\nMitigating Conditions that might be applicable are that there is a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future, by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, and changing the\n\n4\nenvironment where drugs were used (AG \u00b6 26 b 1 and 2). The mitigating factors are applicable here\nsince he has demonstrated an intent not to use and no longer associates with the same people with\nwhom he used while in college. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude Applicant\u2019s youth, record of conduct, and candor justifies a\nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him. He\nis an intelligent young man with a promising career whose college life and indiscretions are behind\nhim as he embarks on a career in his chosen field. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

On December 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\nThis was typed incorrectly in the Judge\u2019s decision.\n1\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 20, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Christopher Graham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law; whether the Judge\u2019s\napplication of Guideline H mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We\nremand the case to the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant has no prior military service and\nwas granted a security clearance in 2003.  Prior to the events of September 11, 2001, he was\nemployed in the financial industry for 19 years.  His company\u2019s offices were destroyed in the attack\non the World Trade Center.  Applicant also lost a close friend, and his mother was hospitalized with\na nervous breakdown.  In November 2001, his employer laid off 400 people, including Applicant.\nDuring this time, Applicant used marijuana approximately six times, due to the stress.  There were\nother friends who had also lost jobs and lost friends in the tragic events.  This group of friends would\nsocialize and on occasion smoke marijuana.  This lasted between one and two months.  Applicant\nmoved when he found employment, and has not seen these people since 2001.  \nApplicant found work in October 2002, and his employer required a drug test.  He passed the\ntest.  In March 2003 Applicant accepted employment with his current employer and again passed a\ndrug test, which was a condition of employment.  He was granted a security clearance in July 2003.\nIn November 2004, Applicant and his wife were on a camping trip with some couples that\nthey recently met.  One evening after the children were in bed, Applicant was sitting around the\ncampfire talking with some of the men.  At some point, someone lit up a marijuana cigarette and\nstarted passing it around.  Without thinking, Applicant took a couple puffs and passed it on.  At that\npoint, his wife told him what he had just done.  He immediately left the area, and he and his wife\nretired for the evening.  There was no evidence prior to that evening, nor did he expect, that this\ngroup would be smoking marijuana.  After that trip, Applicant his wife disengaged from the people,\nand only see them sometimes at school events.  \nOn April 14, 2003, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) and answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cQuestion 27.  Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal\nUse of Drugs.  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used\nany controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,1\ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d   He failed to disclose\nhis marijuana use in the late fall of 2001.  \n\n3\nIn 2005, Applicant submitted an application with a federal government agency and took and\npassed a drug screening test.  He was also required to complete a SF 86.  In filling out the form, he\nnoticed for the first time that question 27 asked about drug use for the last seven years.  He realized\nhe had misread the SF 86 he completed in 2003.  Most employee applications in the financial\ncommunity generally went back only for a 12 month period.  He had no knowledge of the security\nclearance process.  In the 2005 application, he correctly listed his marijuana usage in 2001 and 2004.\nApplicant took full responsibility for his mistakes.  He signed a statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any future violation of Guideline H (Drug involvement).  If\nhe were exposed to illegal drug use anywhere, he would remove himself from the situation.  When\nhe received the SOR, he reported it to his employer\u2019s ethics committee, which referred him to the\ndirector of security.  Applicant talked to the director of security and followed his advice regarding\nthe process.\nThe vice president and division manager of Applicant\u2019s employer testified that he was\nsurprised when Applicant told him about the SOR.  He said it was out of character, and he advised\nhim to work through the system as hard as he could and be as straightforward and honest as he had\nbeen.  He believed the incidents were lapses of judgment, he saw no change in character from the\nperson that he hired, and felt that there was no discrepancy between the person he hired and in the\nperson that had been working for him.  Applicant\u2019s performance had significantly increased.  He\nwanted Applicant to continue to work for him.  That witness has held a security clearance since\n1966, and he believed that Applicant should be granted a clearance.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \nThe Judge\u2019s findings will be discussed below insofar as they relate to his conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this\nstandard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge.  We review matters\nof law de novo.\n\n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\n2\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n\u201c[A] demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\n3\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2001 is understandable considering the circumstances of dealing with the\n4\ncollapse of the World Trade Center, the loss of his job, the loss of his best friend, and the hospitalization of his mother.\nSeveral other acquaintances had similar problems.\u201d Decision at 7.  \u201cIt\u2019s plausible to see Applicant sitting around with\nthese persons, consoling each other by sharing alcohol and an occasional joint.  It is reasonable to believe that given the\nimpact of 9/11 and the loss of one\u2019s job, a group might join to (sic) together to drown their sorrows with beer and a few\njoints get passed around.\u201d Decision at 8.\n4\n(1) Guideline E.  The Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion under Guideline E is sustainable given\nthe fact that the omission on his 2003 SF 86 was an isolated incident, it occurred at a time when\nApplicant was unfamiliar with the security clearance process, prior to being asked about the\nomission Applicant subsequently provided the correct information in response to the same question\non his 2005 SF 86, and Applicant had otherwise favorable character recommendations.  On this\nrecord, the Judge could plausibly conclude that Applicant\u2019s explanations were not unreasonable\nwhen viewed in their time sequence and context, and Applicant\u2019s initial lack of awareness of the\nseriousness of the issue.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion, although not the only reasonable\ninterpretation in that regard, is not per se arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDepartment Counsel for his part offers a plausible alternative interpretation of the record\nevidence consistent with an adverse resolution under Guideline E.  That alternative interpretation\nof the record evidence does not demonstrate harmful error.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).\n \n(2) Guideline H.  The Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline H is\nproblematic.  The record contains significant evidence which could arguably support a favorable\napplication of Guideline H Mitigating Conditions 26 (a)  and (b),  including the fact that Applicant\n2\n3\nhad used marijuana on only a few occasions, that his last use occurred in 2004, that his use had\nhappened under unusual circumstances that were not likely to recur, that he had disassociated\nhimself from drug using individuals and the environment where drugs were used, and that he had\nsigned a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any future violations.\nHowever, in his conclusions, the Judge used language which could be construed as not being\nconsistent with DoD policy or prior Appeal Board decisions, in particular, describing illegal drug\nuse in a way that suggested it was \u201creasonable\u201d under certain circumstances.   The objectionable\n4\nnature of the language significantly detracts from the Judge\u2019s overall analysis of Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances and leaves the decision unsustainable as written.  The Board, therefore, remands the\ncase to the Judge for the issuance of a new decision which analyzes Applicant\u2019s conduct under\nGuideline H in a manner consistent with DoD policy, prior Appeal Board decisions, and the\nprovisions of the Directive.  \n  \n\n5\nOrder\nThe decision the Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Sparks, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 45-year-old deputy program manager employed by a federal contractor.  He\nsmoked marijuana six times in 2001.  After obtaining a security clearance, in 2004, he smoked\nmarijuana once.  The drug use is not recent, he no longer associates with other persons involved, and\nhe signed a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.  He successfully mitigated the\nsecurity concerns about drug involvement.  He also gave one false answer on a security clearance\napplication in 2003.  His actions were negligent, but not deliberate, and the government failed to\nmake its case about personal conduct.  Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 12, 2005).\n1\nTr. at 13, 39.\n2\nId. at 15.\n3\nId. at 13.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 12, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 22, 2006, detailing\nthe basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending\nofficial amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the\nSOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006,\nDoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 12, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on March 14, 2007.  I convened a hearing on April 4, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to issue Applicant a security clearance.  The\ngovernment offered four exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-4.  Applicant offered fifteen exhibits,\nmarked as Exhibits A-K and M-P.  The government objected to Exhibit D, which was overruled.\nAll other exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 12,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 45-year-old deputy program manager employed by a federal contractor.   He\n2\nis married and has three children.   He has a masters in business administration (MBA) in\n3\nmanagement.   He has no prior military service and was granted a security clearance in 2003.\n4\n5\nApplicant was employed in the financial industry for 19 years prior to the events of\nSeptember 11, 2001.  In November 2001, his employer laid off 400 people, including Applicant.\nThe company\u2019s offices were destroyed in the World Trade Center collapse.  He also lost a close\nfriend, and his mother was hospitalized with a nervous breakdown.  During this time, he used\n\nId. at 14-17.\n6\nId. at 18-20.\n7\nId. at 26.\n8\nId. at 56-58.\n9\nId. at 27-32.\n10\n Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I (Statement of Intent, dated January 12, 2007) at 1; Tr. at 38-39.\n11\n4\nmarijuana approximately 6 times, due to the stress.  There were other friends who had also lost jobs\nand lost friends in the tragic events.  This group of friends would socialize and on occasion smoke\nmarijuana.  This lasted between one and two months.  He moved when he found employment, and\nhas not seen these people since 2001.   \n6\nHe found work in October 2002, and his employer required a drug test.  He passed the test.\nIn March 2003, he accepted employment, with his current employer, and again passed a drug test,\nwhich was a condition of employment.   He was granted a security clearance on July 18, 2003.\n7\nIn November 2004, Applicant and his wife were on a camping trip with some couples that\nthey recently met.  One evening after the children were in bed, applicant was sitting around the\ncampfire talking with some of the men.  At some point, someone lit up a marijuana cigarette and\nstarted passing it around.  Without thinking, Applicant took a couple puffs and passed it on.  At that\npoint, his wife told him what he had just done.  He immediately left the area, and he and his wife\nretired for the evening.  There was no evidence prior to that evening, nor did he expect, that this\ngroup would be smoking marijuana.  After that trip, Applicant his wife disengaged from the people,\nand only see them sometimes at school events.  \nOn April 14, 2003, applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86), and he\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cQuestion 27.  Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug\nActivity - Illegal Use of Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have\nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates,\ndomestic law alone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d\nHe failed to disclose his marijuana use in the late fall of 2001.  \nIn 2005, Applicant submitted an application with a federal government agency, and took and\npassed a drug screen.

In the 2005 application, he correctly listed his marijuana usage in 2001 and 2004.   \n10\nApplicant took full responsibility for his mistakes.  He signed a statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any future violation of Guideline H (drug involvement.)   If\n11\n\nTr. at 60-61.\n12\nId. at 35-37.\n13\nId. at 66-69.\n14\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n15\n5\nhe were exposed to illegal drug use anywhere, he would remove himself from the situation.   When\n12\nhe received the SOR, he reported it to his employer\u2019s ethics committee, which referred him to the\ndirector of security.  Applicant talked to the director of security and followed his advice regarding\nthe process.13\nThe vice president and division manager of Applicant\u2019s employer testified that he was\nsurprised when Applicant told him about the SOR.  He said it was out of character, and he advised\nhim to work through the system as hard as he could and be as straightforward and honest as he had\nbeen.  He believed the incidents were lapses of judgment, he saw no change in character from the\nperson that he hired, and felt that there was no discrepancy between the person he hired and in the\nperson that had been working for him.  Applicant\u2019s performance had significantly increased.  He\nwanted Applicant to continue to work for him.  The witness has held a security clearance since 1966,\nand he believed that Applicant should be granted a clearance.14\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines are\ndivided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.15\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n16\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n17\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n18\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n19\n6\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n16\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n17\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n19\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nGuidelines \u00b6 24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction.\nGuidelines \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nApplicant admitted smoking marijuana six times in 2001, and one time in 2004.  Applicant\nadmitted that he smoked marijuana one time, while holding a security clearance.\nGuidelines \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;(2 and him ) changing or avoiding\nthe environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2001 is understandable considering the circumstances of dealing\nwith the collapse of the World Trade Center, the loss of his job, the loss of his best friend, and the\nhospitalization of his mother.  Several other acquaintances had similar problems.  It\u2019s plausible to\nsee Applicant sitting around with these persons, consoling each other by sharing alcohol and an\noccasional joint.  He no longer associates with these people.  It occurred five years ago and is not\nrecent.  The other use in 2004 was an aberrational event.  Applicant got caught up in the moment\naround the campfire when someone passed a joint.  He took two puffs, passed it along, and at that\npoint, his wife interrupted him and asked him what he was thinking about.  He realized his mistake,\nwithdrew, and they have had no further social contact with these people.  Applicant stated his intent\nnot to use drugs in the future, and signed a statement of intent that provides automatic revocation of\n\n8\nhis clearance for any drug violation.  I find that Guidelines \u00b6 26 (a), (b) (1,3,and 4) apply and I\nconclude guideline H for Applicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant admitted that he answered Question 27. incorrectly on the 2003 security clearance\napplication.  He explained that in his 19 year history with financial industry, it\u2019s a question about\ndrugs appeared on an employment application, it normally only ask for drug use in the past 12\nmonths.  He admitted he did not read the form carefully, and he was commuting several hundred\nmiles between his old and new jobs.  I characterize his conduct as negligent, but not deliberate, and\ntherefore the government has failed to make its case under guideline E.\nIf, assuming arguendo, that the government did make its case, then the following mitigating\nconditions apply to mitigate the security concerns:\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\nand\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under\ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nApplicant corrected his mistake regarding question 27 on his 2005 security clearance\napplication.  He answered questions truthfully to DSS investigators, he self-reported to his\ncompany\u2019s ethics committee.  Based on the testimony of his division manager, his employer believes\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n20\nId.\n21\nId.\n22\n9\nthat the offenses did not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nHe has acknowledged the behavior and the stressors and circumstances of the 2001 marijuana use\nno longer exist.  He no longer associates with the persons that provided the marijuana in 2004.  Such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n20\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n21\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (45),\n22\nhis education which includes a MBA, his employment, and what might motivate him to be less than\ntruthful.  Applicant supplied a false answer on a security clearance application.  This is problematic\nbecause candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself, then he may be trusted\nwith confidential or classified information.  Applicant was unfamiliar with the security clearance\nprocess.  He had spent 19 years in the financial industry where the only questions about drug use\nasked for the prior 12 month period.  It is reasonable to believe that given the impact of 9/11 and the\nloss of one\u2019s job, a group might join to together to drown their sorrows with beer and a few joints\nget passed around.\nLikewise, he\u2019s sitting around the campfire on a camping trip, engrossed in discussion, and\nsomeone passes a joint.  Without thinking, he takes two puffs, passes it on, and then his wife brings\nhim back to reality.  He no longer associates with these people, and he signed a statement of intent\nnot to use drugs in the future.  I am confident this aberrational behavior will not happen again.  He\nhas become a vital part of his company\u2019s team as demonstrated by his division program manager\u2019s\ntestimony.  The totality of the record raises no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's\nability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion\nexpected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is  clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Sparks, Esquire \n \n \n \n____________________ \n \nDecision on Remand \n____________________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding his marijuana use and failure to \nprovide accurate information on his security clearance application. Clearance is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 12, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On December 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 12, 2005). For \nconvenience, the security clearance application in this decision will be called an SF 86. There is no \nallegation of falsification of the 2005 SF 86.   \n \n2Exhibit I (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Dec. 22, 2006). Exhibit I is the source for the facts \nin the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer dated January 12, 2007, and received at DOHA on January 22, \n2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided at a hearing.4 The case was assigned to Judge Graham on February 27, 2007.  \nA hearing was held on April 4, 2007.  At the hearing, the Government offered four \nexhibits (GE 1-4), and Applicant offered 15 exhibits (AE A-K and M-P). The Government \nobjected to consideration of AE D5 because OPM\u2019s opinion that there were no security \nissues is not relevant (R. 30). Judge Graham overruled the Government objection (R. \n30).6 All other exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(R.) on April 12, 2007. Judge Graham issued his decision granting a clearance on July \n20, 2007. \n \nAppellate Litigation \n \nThe Government appealed Judge Graham\u2019s decision.7 On December 17, 2007, \nthe Appeal Board remanded the Applicant\u2019s case for a new decision. The Appeal \nBoard\u2019s sustained Judge Graham\u2019s decision that Applicant had mitigated the security \nconcerns pertaining to the allegation that he omitted information from his 2003 SF 86 \nstating: \n \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion under Guideline E is sustainable given \nthe fact that the omission on his 2003 SF 86 was an isolated incident, it \noccurred at a time when Applicant was unfamiliar with the security \nclearance process, prior to being asked about the omission Applicant \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Exhibit II (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated Nov. 12, 2006).  \n \n5 AE D is an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) document indicating that as of August 31, \n2005, there were no security issues concerning Applicant\u2019s background. \n \n6I will consider the OPM document (AE D) for the limited purpose of showing that OPM did not \nfind any security issues in addition to those currently discussed in this opinion. \n \n7The briefs filed by the parties were not part of the file provided to me. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsubsequently provided the correct information in response to the same \nquestion on his 2005 SF 86, and Applicant had otherwise favorable \ncharacter recommendations. On this record, the Judge could plausibly \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s explanations were not unreasonable when \nviewed in their time sequence and context, and Applicant\u2019s initial lack of \nawareness of the seriousness of the issue. Therefore, the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion, although not the only reasonable interpretation in that regard, \nis not per se arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \n \nISCR Case No. 06-22755 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007) at 3-4. \n \nIn regard to the Guideline H security concerns, the Appeal Board noted that \nApplicant had provided evidence which might support application of several mitigating \nconditions; however, Judge Graham\u2019s opinion contained \u201cproblematic\u201d language \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s rationale for using marijuana.  The Appeal Board stated: \n \n(2) Guideline H. The Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s conduct under \nGuideline H is problematic. The record contains significant evidence which \ncould arguably support a favorable application of Guideline H Mitigating \nConditions 26 (a) and (b), including the fact that Applicant had used \nmarijuana on only a few occasions, that his last use occurred in 2004, that \nhis use had happened under unusual circumstances that were not likely to \nrecur, that he had disassociated himself from drug using individuals and \nthe environment where drugs were used, and that he had signed a \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any future \nviolations. \n \nHowever, in his conclusions, the Judge used language which could be \nconstrued as not being consistent with DoD policy or prior Appeal Board \ndecisions, in particular, describing illegal drug use in a way that suggested \nit was \u201creasonable\u201d under certain circumstances. The objectionable nature \nof the language significantly detracts from the Judge\u2019s overall analysis of \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances and leaves the decision unsustainable as \nwritten.  \n \nId. at 4 (footnotes omitted). \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case \u201cfor the issuance of a new \ndecision which analyzes Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline H in a manner consistent \nwith DoD policy, prior Appeal Board decisions, and the provisions of the Directive.\u201d  Id.   \nI will briefly state facts pertaining to the Guideline E allegation in the Findings of Fact, \nbecause they explain how the marijuana use was disclosed. These facts are also \nrelevant to credibility and the \u201cWhole Person Concept.\u201d  However, I will not discuss the \nGuideline E allegation, or restate Judge Graham\u2019s findings or conclusions in the \nAnalysis or the Formal Findings sections of this decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted in his response to the \nSOR that he used marijuana in late 2001, and in the fall of 2004, while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He also admitted that he failed to disclose the marijuana use in 2001 \nwhen he completed his 2003 SF 86. His response to the SOR also provided mitigating \ninformation concerning the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old (R. 45). On March 17, 2003, he began his current \nemployment and was granted a security clearance in July 2003 (R. 63). He is currently \na deputy program manager employed by a federal contractor (R. 13, 39). Prior to the \nstart of his government Applicant was employed on Wall Street for 19 years (R. 13), and \nas a cargo manager at a large airport (R. 18). He has been married for 18 years, and \nhas three boys, ages 10, 12 and 14 (R. 15). He has a masters degree in business \nadministration (R. 63). Applicant has no prior military service. \n \nMarijuana Use \n \nOn September 12, 2001, the day after the World Trade Center collapse, \nApplicant\u2019s office building collapsed (R. 14). He lost a close friend in the attack (R. 15), \nand his mother was hospitalized with a nervous breakdown. In November 2001, \nApplicant\u2019s employer laid him off, along with about 400 other employees (R. 14). \nApplicant was socializing with other workers from the financial industry. Some of the \nworkers had lost friends on 9/11, and/or were unemployed (R. 16-17).  Marijuana use \noccurred in this group. Applicant used marijuana approximately six times, during an \napproximately 60-day period (R. 16-17, 51). He said the decision to use marijuana was \ndue to stress (R. 16). He recognized that he was associating with the wrong type of \npeople (R. 16). He moved when he found employment and has not associated with the \nmarijuana users in New York since 2001 (R. 25).  \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant and his wife were on an overnight camping/rafting \ntrip with about 40 people from a church group that they had recently met (R. 21-23). \nOne evening after the children were in bed, Applicant was sitting around the campfire \ntalking with some of the men (R. 23). At some point, someone lit up a marijuana \ncigarette and started passing it around (R. 23). Without considering the ramifications of \nusing marijuana, Applicant took a couple puffs and passed it on. At that point, his wife \ntold him what he had just done (R. 24), and she gave him \u201chell for it\u201d (R. 50). He \nimmediately left the area, and he and his wife retired for the evening. There was no \nevidence prior to that evening, nor did he expect, that this group would be smoking \nmarijuana (R. 24). After that trip, Applicant and his wife ended their association from the \npeople who were on the camping trip (R. 25). He currently only sees them occasionally \nat school events (R. 25).  He described his decision to use marijuana in 2004 as a \u201cbad \ndecision\u201d and a \u201clapse in judgment\u201d (R. 23-24, 38).  He recognized almost immediately \nafter using the marijuana that it was illegal, and during the confrontation with his wife, he \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nrecognized his misconduct was aggravated by his holding a security clearance (R. 24, \n49-50).8 He did not consider a single use of marijuana to be drug \u201cabuse\u201d because he \nequated drug abuse with drug addiction (R. 49).   \n \nApplicant took responsibility for his lapses in judgment concerning his marijuana \nuse (R. 39, 60-61). He passed his employer\u2019s drug test in 2002 (R. 18-19). In March \n2003 Applicant accepted employment with his current employer and again passed a \ndrug test, which was a condition of employment (R. 19-20; AE A). In 2005, he passed \nanother employment-related drug test (R. 30-31; AE B, E).  He said if he was exposed \nto drug use in the future, he would remove himself from the location (R. 38). He signed \na statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any future violation of \nGuideline H (Drug involvement) (R. 39). He denied that he would use drugs in the \nfuture, citing the importance of his security clearance and desire to be a role model for \nhis children (R. 60). \n \n2003 and 2005 Security Clearance Applications  \n \nOn April 14, 2003, Applicant executed his SF 86, and he answered, \u201cNo\u201d to the \nfollowing question: \n \nQuestion 27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use \nof Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, \nhave you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, \ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription \ndrugs?\u201d   \n \nApplicant described the completion of the 2003 SF 86 as \u201crushed\u201d and contended \nhe overlooked the requirement for seven years of information about marijuana use (R. \n55-56).  He did not leave out the drug information because he was worried about being \nhired, as a security clearance was not a prerequisite for the employment (R. 57).  He \ndenied that he deliberately omitted information about his 2001 marijuana use (R. 58).   \n  \n In 2005, Applicant submitted an application with a federal government agency \nand took and passed a drug screening test (R. 26; AE B). He was also required to \ncomplete a SF 86. In filling out 2005 SF 86, he noticed for the first time that Question 27 \nasked about drug use for the last seven years (R. 28-29). He realized he had misread \nthe SF 86 he completed in 2003. Most employee applications in the financial community \ngenerally went back only for a 12 month period (R. 28-29, 56). In 2003, he had no \nknowledge of the security clearance process. In the 2005 application, he correctly listed \nhis marijuana usage in 2001 and 2004 (R. 18, 28).  On December 12, 2005, he provided \na statement to an OPM investigator that was consistent with his description of his drug \nuse at the hearing (R. 33; AE G).  \n \n8 A contractor-managed training program informed Applicant that use of marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance was forbidden (R. 48). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n    \nThe vice president and division manager of Applicant\u2019s corporation has been \nemployed by that corporation for 13 years, and he has held a security clearance since \n1966 (R. 65, 69). He supervises approximately 100 personnel (R. 66). Applicant worked \nfor him for about four years, and his office is three doors down from Applicant\u2019s office \n(R. 66-67). He was surprised when Applicant told him about marijuana use and the \nomission of his drug use from his 2003 SF 86 (R. 67). He believed it was out of \ncharacter (R. 67). He advised Applicant to work through the system, and continue to be \nstraightforward and honest (R. 67). He believed the incidents were lapses of judgment, \nhe saw no change in character from the person that he hired, and he felt that there was \nno discrepancy between the person he hired and in the person that had been working \nfor him (R. 68). Applicant\u2019s performance had significantly increased. He described \nApplicant\u2019s work as excellent, and he wanted Applicant to continue to work for him (R. \n69). He recommended that Applicant be granted a clearance (R. 69). \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals laud his hard work, dedication and initiative \n(AE O-P). His performance is described as outstanding and superb. He is an important \nasset to the corporation. He has strong leadership skills and is a role model for other \nemployees. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \n \n9 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n10 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nGuideline \u00b6 24 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning drug11 \ninvolvement stating, \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d12 \u201cillegal drug possession,\u201d and \n\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). The other five disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  These \nthree disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used marijuana in 2001 and \n2004.  His 2004 marijuana use occurred while he was holding a security clearance. His \n2004 marijuana use breached the government\u2019s trust encompassed by holding a \nsecurity clearance and raises especially serious security concerns. \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n \n11Guideline \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. Sch. I (c)(10). \n  \n12 Guideline \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d13 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in \nNovember 2004, which is still relatively recent.14 His overall marijuana use included a \n \n13 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence \nof drug use for five years prior to the hearing.  The Appeal Board determined that the judge excessively \nemphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, and gave \ntoo little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy.  For the recency analysis the Appeal Board stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \n14 In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the \nrecency analysis of an Administrative Judge stating: \n \nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history \nof improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the \nsecurity clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times \na year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the \nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nrelapse from his previous marijuana abuse in 2001.15 This mitigating condition is not \nfully applicable. However, he receives some credit for only using marijuana once in \nNovember 2004, for not using any drugs thereafter, and based on his commitment not \nto use drugs in the future.16 Based on all the facts and circumstances, he has met his \nburden of establishing that his drug use will not recur, and because he will not use \ndrugs his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment is not undermined.   \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has \u201csignificantly\u201d disassociated from drug-using \nassociates and contacts; avoided the environment where drugs were used; abstained \nfrom drug abuse since November 2004; and signed a statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. He only used marijuana once in 2004, and did \nnot use any other illegal drugs after completing his SF 86. Guideline \u00b6 26(b) is \napplicable and significantly mitigates the security concerns involving his drug \ninvolvement.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because his abuse of marijuana did not follow an \nillness, and marijuana was never prescribed for him. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable \nbecause he has not completed a prescribed drug treatment program, and there has not \nbeen a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \nApplicant has permanently committed to abstaining from illegal drug use. He has \ndissociated from those who abuse drugs. He did not disclose any internal motivation to \nrefrain from drug abuse, but the motivations to stop using drugs are evident.17  He has \nshown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse.   \n \n \n \n \n15 In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. In ISCR Case \nNo. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board explained: \n \n[W]here an applicant had extensive marijuana use and renewed marijuana use after \nperiods of abstinence, a Judge may articulate a rational basis for doubts about whether \nthe most recent period of abstinence was sufficient to conclude the applicant had put \nmarijuana use behind them. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, \n2004). \n \n16 See whole person analysis, infra. See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2006) (indicating when a mitigating condition cannot be fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still available under \nthat same mitigating condition). \n \n17Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free.  \n  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n  \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana abuse was knowledgeable and voluntary. He was 41 years \nold when he last used marijuana, and was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for \nhis conduct. Abuse of drugs is not prudent or responsible. Abuse of marijuana violates \nstate criminal laws. Use of marijuana violates DoD policy. His marijuana use, while \nholding a security clearance, is particularly aggravating, and weighs heavily against \ngranting or continuing his security clearance. \n \n  \nThere is substantial evidence that mitigates his conduct. The likelihood of future \ndrug abuse is minimal. Sufficient time has elapsed since his last marijuana use in \nNovember 2004 to provide some assurance that he will not use drugs again. He \nprovided evidence of remorse, or regret concerning drug abuse. His record of good \nemployment weighs in his favor. His wife is against drug abuse, and he does not \nassociate with drug abusers. He provided a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. His past abuse of illegal drugs does not create \ncurrent doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and it does not call \ninto question his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n  \n \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-03941 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007), the Appeal Board \nsustained the Administrative Judge\u2019s grant of that Applicant\u2019s clearance, and succinctly \nsummarized the evidence regarding drug use and mitigating evidence under the \nprevious guidelines: \n \nThe record indicates that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nbetween 1991 and 2004. Applicant also used psilocybin mushrooms \nbetween 1993 and 2003, but testified that he used them only a few times. \nIn a signed, sworn statement dated November 18, 2004, Applicant stated \nthat he had last used marijuana in August 2004. He stated that he now \nunderstood the impact that drug use would have on his job and that he \nwould no longer use marijuana or mushrooms. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe Appeal Board reasoned that Applicant's drug use was mitigated \u201cdue to the \npassage of time (DIMC 1) and Applicant's stated intention not to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture (DIMC 3).\u201d Id. The Appeal Board cited the Judge\u2019s findings: \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he had not used marijuana since he signed \nthe affidavit in November 2004, over two years before the hearing.  The \nJudge based his application of DIMC 3 in part on Applicant's statement \nthat marijuana was not worth damaging his career and in part on changes \nin Applicant's life-the fact that Applicant had since married and was \ncontemplating starting a family. (internal citations omitted). \n \nApplicant presented sufficient mitigating evidence to counter the information \nabout his marijuana abuse. He stopped using marijuana in November 2004 and desires \nto maintain his drug-free status in the future. He voluntarily and candidly disclosed his \nmarijuana abuse on his 2005 SF 86. Applicant provided the only record evidence \nshowing his marijuana abuse. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his \nemployer\u2019s rules or requirements, and his sincerity about making future progress weigh \nin his favor. Abstaining from drug abuse for about three years shows significant efforts \nto establish his responsibility and rehabilitation. \n \nIn sum, the likelihood of recurrence is low because there is evidence about \nimprovement in his understanding of his situation. Although he did not receive \ncounseling or therapy, he does have a clear perception of, or understanding about, how \nto avoid problematic situations and why he abused drugs. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug \ninvolvement. The evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility \nand suitability.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d18 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is \neligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \n18See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to meet his burden to successfully explain, mitigate, or extenuate the security\nconcern stemming from his history of financial problems. Clearance is denied.\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n The SOR was amended to correct a clerical error with the date, and January 27, 2007, is the correct date (R.\n2\n18\u201321).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n3\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nJanuary 27, 2007.  The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the\n2\nfactual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. Applicant timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n3\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated January 27, 2007. This matter was noted on\nthe record at the start of the hearing (R. 19).\nThe case was assigned to me March 12, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the\nhearing for April 12, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript April 23, 2007.\nThe record was kept open until May 11, 2007, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and those matters were\nforwarded by department counsel who voiced no objections to the post-hearing exhibits, which are\nadmitted as follows: (1) Exhibit I\u2013cover letter; (2) Exhibit J\u2013DD Form 214; (3) Exhibit K\u2013account\nstatement for debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.m; (4) Exhibit L\u2013IRS account transcript for tax\nperiod 2003; (5) Exhibit M\u2013IRS account transcript for tax period 2004; and (6) Exhibit N\u2013debt-\nmanagement program (DMP) documentation.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations was mixed. He admitted all the indebtedness\nexcept for the debt in subparagraph 1.n, which he disputes. His admissions and explanations are\nincorporated herein. I make the following findings of fact set forth below in numbered paragraphs.\n1.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior associate for a company engaged in defense contracting.\nIn September 2005, he completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). In response to\nQuestions 27b, 28a, and 28b, he disclosed derogatory information about his financial record (a wage\ngarnishment and several delinquent accounts). \n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, and that history is verified by credit reports\nfrom 2001, 2005, 2006, and 2007 (Exhibits 2\u20135). Based on this history, the SOR sets forth 14\ndelinquent accounts for about $45,000, consisting of consumer debts. Applicant traces his history\nof financial problems to two divorces and periods of unemployment and underemployment as\ndiscussed below. \n3.\nBefore working as a defense contractor, Applicant was a professional soldier in the U.S.\nArmy for nearly 15 years (Exhibit J). He enlisted in December 1986, and was promoted up the ranks\nto sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). His initial duties were in the field of signals intelligence,\nwhich included training in a foreign language. He then applied for and successfully completed the\nspecial forces assessment and selection process. Next, he completed the special operations medical\nsergeant course in 1991, and went on to serve as a special forces medical sergeant for nearly nine\nyears. He continued to attend training courses consistent with his rank and duties in the special\nforces. While in the Army, Applicant held a security clearance at the top-secret and secret levels. He\nelected to leave active duty in August 2001, and he received an honorable discharge.\n3.\nWhen he was 20 years old, Applicant married his first wife in November 1986, and he joined\nthe Army the following month. They had a son in 1987. The marriage ended in divorce in December\n1988. As a result of the divorce, he incurred a child support obligation, which he paid via a monthly\nallotment from his military pay. \n4.\nIn 1994, Applicant married his second wife. This marriage did not produce any children, and\nit ended in divorce in September 1998. The divorce decree (Exhibit A) addressed liabilities to be\npaid by each spouse. When the parties separated in about 1997, his wife had consumer debts in her\nname in the approximate amount of $16,000. As a result, Applicant was ordered to make monthly\npayments to his ex-wife of $375 for 20 months beginning (and retroactive to) April 1, 1998, by\nallotment from his military pay. In other words, Applicant was ordered to pay $7,500 of the debt his\nwife had incurred in her name. He was also assigned the debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and\n1.m, which were in the thousands of dollars. His wife was assigned to pay 13 accounts for more than\n$15,000. Due to his two divorces, Applicant was paying child support from his first marriage and\nthe $375 monthly debt payment from his second marriage at the same time while his income was\nlimited to his military pay. \n5.\nApplicant married his third and current spouse in March 1999. After leaving the Army in\nAugust 2001, Applicant was unemployed until December 2001. During this time his income was\nlimited to unemployment benefits, which was a reduction in income from his military pay of about\n\n4\n50% (R. 61). He began a job as a security guard in December 2001 earning $8 to $10 per hour. The\njob was initially part-time, but became a full-time 40-hour per week job. This was a reduction from\nthe unemployment benefits and far less than he earned while in the Army. He continued, however,\nto have the same obligations to pay child support and credit card payments.\n6.\nIn November 2002, he obtained work as an independent contractor for a company engaged\nin defense contracting. The work consisted of travel to client sites where the work was performed\nand report writing at his residence after each trip. The trips were from one to three weeks in duration.\nAs an independent contractor, Applicant was responsible for financing his travel expenses, which\nhe would then seek reimbursement for by submitting vouchers. Payment of vouchers was usually 30\ndays after submission. During this time, Applicant was unaware that, being self-employed, he was\nrequired to make quarterly income tax payments to the IRS. This resulted in a delinquent tax bill and\npenalties. Applicant resolved this by entering into an installment agreement with the IRS during\n2004\u20132006, and he satisfied his tax debt by paying $2,981 in total (Exhibits D, L, and M). Most of\nthe installment payments were made in 2005. \n7.\nIn April 2003, Applicant was offered and accepted a full-time position with the same\ncompany. This lessened his financial strain because he could receive advances for business travel\nand was reimbursed more quickly. Also, he received employee benefits. After a few months,\nApplicant became dissatisfied, and in July 2003 he gave notice and left the company in August 2003.\n  \n8.\nDuring June 2003, Applicant\u2019s vehicle had a major engine failure that he could not afford\nto repair. Consequently, Applicant and his wife got around by using public transportation or walking.\nApplicant has not replaced the vehicle, and he and his wife continue to use public transportation or\nwalk.   \n9.\nAs of September 2003, Applicant pursued various opportunities to work in Iraq as a security\nadvisor, but none of the potential contracts were realized. This process unfolded during September\n2003 through February 2004, and Applicant was unemployed during this period. In March and April\n2004, Applicant picked up a couple of consulting jobs for a security company. He received lump-\nsum payments for this work, and he used the money to try to catch up on his child support arrears.\n10.\nBy summer 2004, he was struggling to pay necessary expenses like rent and utilities. In\nOctober 2004, he decided he had to get a regular paycheck coming in, and he took a job as a dish\nwasher at a restaurant. This allowed him to walk back-and-forth to work. The job was a part-time\nposition working 25 to 30 hours a week. He worked there until June or July 2005 when he was\nrehired by the defense contractor that he left in August 2003. After he was rehired, the company was\nacquired by a major defense contractor, and Applicant continued his employment in the same\nposition for the new company.  \n11.\nIn about June 2005, Applicant\u2019s first ex-wife initiated a garnishment action for child support\narrears. This garnishment remained in effect until sometime in 2006. It resulted in about $1,730\nbeing withheld from his pay to satisfy the child support arrears (Exhibit E).\n12.\nSince resuming full-time employment as a company employee in about July or August 2005,\nApplicant has made progress in addressing his financial problems. He paid off his tax debt to the IRS\nvia the installment agreement by paying $2,981, and he paid off child support arrears via the\ngarnishment by paying $1,730. Also, he made a lump-sum payment of $2,857 in February 2006 via\n\n5\nan income tax refund intercept for the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.m (Exhibit B). This\nparticular debt was paid off in March 2007 with a lump-sum payment of $5,524 via another income\ntax refund intercept (Exhibits G and K). \n13.\nAbout one year after resuming full-time employment, Applicant and his wife sought help to\naddress their debts. Given that Applicant travels often for business, his wife handles bill paying and\nother financial chores. Consequently, she met with and set up a voluntary DMP with a credit-\ncounseling agency in July 2006 (Exhibit C). The gist of the DMP is that the agency sets up and\nmanages the DMP, and they debit Applicant\u2019s account for the monthly amount. In turn, the agency\nuses the funds to pay the listed creditors. The plan only applies to the creditors listed on the\nrepayment schedule. When established in July 2006, the repayment schedule listed six accounts for\na total of $34,284, and estimated it would take 50 months to complete repayment. One creditor (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.m) has since withdrawn from the DMP. From July 2006 through April 2007,\nApplicant made ten monthly payments, with none missed or late, and the DMP is in good standing\n(Exhibit N). In total, Applicant has paid $7,545 into the DMP for an average of about $750 per\nmonth (Exhibits F and N). According to a letter from the agency, the program is successfully\ncompleted when all of the \u201clisted accounts\u201d have been paid off in full through the DMP (Exhibit N).\n14.\nApplicant believes the DMP includes all his debts, including those in the SOR (R. 139).  In\nhis post-hearing submission, Applicant explained that he contacted the agency handling the DMP\nand was told that all of his outstanding debts are included in their electronic record, and that they\nonly comment on accounts currently being serviced (Exhibit I). Once an account is satisfied,\nApplicant believes that payment will begin on another debt (R. 80). \n15.\nApplicant disputes the legitimacy of the $291 debt in SOR subparagraph 1.n. He does so\nbecause they were charged for matters not agreed to in the cell phone contract. He did not provide\nany documentary evidence of this dispute. \n16.\nApplicant summarized his repayment of debt, and other expenses paid during accrual of\nexisting debt, in a written submission (Exhibit H). By my calculations, since resuming full-time\nemployment in August 2005, Applicant has paid $2,981 to the IRS, $1,730 for child support arrears,\n$8,381 to the creditor in subparagraph 1.m via tax intercepts, and $7,545 via the DMP for a total of\n$20,637. \n17.\nHis current annual salary is about $75,000. His wife works as a part-time waitress at a\nrestaurant. Other than a corporate credit card used for business travel, neither Applicant nor his wife\nhas a credit card, and they are not incurring new debt. He estimated a current balance of $600 in his\nchecking account. He participates in his company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan, but he did not know how\nmuch he contributed to the plan and he was unaware of the account balance. He and his wife\ncontinue to live in a rented apartment and plan to do so until their debts are resolved. \nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n6\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. Failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\n\n7\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems. His derogatory financial\nhistory is a security concern because it indicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts and a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations within the meaning of Guideline F.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude he receives credit in mitigation. Each\nMC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. His financial problems are ongoing, and\nhis financial problems involve multiple delinquent debts. Given his longstanding financial problems,\nit is too soon to say that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. \nThe second MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control\u2014applies. Applicant experienced understandable financial strain stemming from his\ntwo divorces. At one time, Applicant was paying both child support and a monthly debt payment due\nto the divorces. Likewise, his periods of unemployment and underemployment limited his ability to\npay his debts. \nThe third MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant has been using the DMP for the last ten months, there is no evidence of any\nfinancial counseling. In addition, given his longstanding financial problems, it is too soon to say that\nit is resolved or under control. \nThe fourth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014applies. In less than two years, Applicant has paid off more than $20,000\nin debt. He has made ten monthly payments to the DMP for more than $7,500 since July 2006. These\ncircumstances are sufficient to qualify for initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the\nguideline.  \nThe fifth MC\u2014the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt\u2014does not apply. Although he may have a basis to dispute the debt in SOR subparagraph 1.n,\nhe has not provided documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute, nor has he provided\nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.  \nThe sixth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is 40 years\nold and sufficiently mature to make thoughtful, prudent decisions about his finances. He has made\nexcellent progress in resolving his outstanding debts since he resumed full-time employment in\n\n8\nAugust 2005. Anyone who has ever dug out of a financial hole can appreciate the significance of\npaying off more than $20,000 of debt in less than two years\u2014it\u2019s a major accomplishment. The\nDMP appears to be a workable method for Applicant and his spouse to resolve the debts in the DMP,\nand they are credited for sticking to the DMP so far.\nOf concern here is the comprehensiveness of the DMP. Applicant maintains that the DMP\ncovers all his outstanding debts, including the debts in the SOR. But review of the documentary\nevidence suggests that the DMP is limited to the listed accounts, which is now five since one\nwithdrew. Indeed, the DMP agreement states that it only applies to creditors listed on the repayment\nschedule (Exhibit C at 2). Given the plain language of the DMP agreement, I cannot conclude that\nthe DMP is comprehensive and includes the debts in the SOR. Although he has documented the\nactions taken to resolve his indebtedness and made a measurable improvement to his situation, he\nhas not established that the DMP is a comprehensive approach for resolving all of his indebtedness.\nThese circumstances militate against a favorable decision for Applicant.  \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations\nsecurity concern. Likewise, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant has more than $33,000 in delinquent debts. He stated the debts were due to\nunderemployment and for medical expenses. The debts date as far back as 2000. He has not\ncontacted any of the creditors, has not attempted to resolve any of the debts and he does not intend\non repaying any of them. He failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 10, 2007\ndetailing the basis for its preliminary decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2. 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2007 and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2007. With the consent of the parties,\nI convened a hearing on May 16, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered three\nexhibits for admission in the record, marked as GE 1-3. The exhibits were admitted into evidence\nwithout objections. Applicant testified on her behalf and offered one exhibit for admission into the\nrecord, marked as AE A. It was admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 58 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2004 as a security\nguard and was recently promoted to supervisor dispatcher. Applicant joined the Navy out of high\nschool and served twenty-three years, retiring honorably as an E-7 in 1990. He was married to his\nfirst wife for 31 years. She died in 2001. He remarried in 2003. Both he and his wife have grown\nchildren. \nApplicant admitted he owes all of the debts alleged in the SOR.  The debts total more than\n1\n$33,000. Applicant provided a written statement that explained: \n\nAE A; Tr. 21-24.\n2\nTr. 45.\n3\nTr. 44.\n4\nTr. 26-28\n5\nId.\n6\nId.\n7\nTr. 46.\n8\nTr. 28-29.\n9\nTr. 43.\n10\nAE A.\n11\nTr. 30-31.\n12\nTr. 32.\n13\n3\nA large portion, if not all of the indebtedness and referrals to collections stem from three\nevents; the death of my first wife of thirty-one years, loss of a high paying job, followed by\ntwo low paying hourly jobs, [m]edical expenses, and funeral costs, relating to my first wife,\npersonnel (sic) medical cost, and the reposition (sic) of two vehicles did cause me to fall\nbehind. My house was also foreclosed on which was the results of the loan company applying\nall payments of escrow to the house payment with nothing being paid to the county for land\ntaxes.2\nApplicant could not identify which of the debts listed in the SOR were for medical expenses.3\nHe admitted the debt in SOR 1.b is likely a credit card debt.  The debts in SOR 1.g and 1.h are car\n4\nrepossessions.  He stated the debt in SOR 1.g was for a 1989 vehicle, bought in 1990 and was\n5\ncharged off in the amount of $3,101 in 2002.  The vehicle in SOR 1.h was for a 1988 vehicle bought\n6\nin 1991, and was charged of in August 2002 for $14,599.  It is unclear as to why Applicant owed so\n7\nmuch money on vehicles that had been purchased 17 and 16 years ago respectively. \nApplicant has not contacted any of the creditors.  He does not know what most of the debts\n8\nare for and has not done any research to obtain information about them.  He admitted he has done\n9\nnothing regarding these debts. He has not made any attempt to repay even the smallest debt in SOR\n1.k of $47.  In Applicant\u2019s written statement he explained: \u201cThe obligations are mine and I have\n10\nalways prided myself in my ability to pay my obligations, however at this stage of my life, closing\nin on retirement; I feel that I can never meet the payment requirements that would favorably erase\nthis problem.\u201d11\nAfter Applicant\u2019s wife died he received social security disability payments that she had been\nowed.  In January 2002 he held a job where he earned $40,000.  He lost this job and was\n12\n13\nunemployed for approximately two months.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n27\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n28\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.29\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\n30\nthan a preponderance.\u201d  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven\n31\nconduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.32\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201cas\n33\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n34\non the side of denial.\u201d35\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\n6\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has many debts that have been delinquent for years with\nno action toward resolving them and he does not intend on paying them.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant\u2019s debts are\nrecent and unpaid and he unequivocally does not intend on paying them. This attitude casts doubt\non his reliability and good judgment. Therefore, FC MC 20(a) does not apply.\nApplicant stated the debts were incurred due to medical expenses related to his deceased\nwife. She died in 2001 and he has had six years to resolve them and has not. Although he stated they\nwere medical debts he could not identify any of the medical debts, had not contacted any of the\ncreditors and acknowledged some debts were for other things. I find even if a portion of the debts\nwere for medical expenses Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances and has no\nintention of resolving any of the debts. Consequently, I find FC MC 20(b) does not apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n7\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nDirective to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant acknowledges his debts, concurs that he\nowes the debts, but has no intention of paying them, despite having the resources to begin paying\nsome of them.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and  evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His grandmother and grandfather are citizens and residents of The Peoples Republic of\nChina (PRC).  His mother-in-law, father- in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of the\nPRC.

Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated August 29, 2005).\n1\nTr. at 10, 17.\n2\nId. at 11.\n3\nId. at 13.\n4\nId. at 15.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 29, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 30, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that\nthis case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 21, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on April 4, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on April 17, 2007.  I convened a hearing on May 9, 2007, to consider whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.\nThe government offered eight exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-8.  Applicant offered six exhibits,\nmarked as Exhibits A-F.  The government objected to Exhibit D, which was overruled.  All other\nexhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 33-year-old managing consultant employed by a federal government\ncontractor.   He is married and has two children.   He has a master\u2019s degree in management\n2\n3\ninformation systems.   He has no prior military service and this is his first application for a security\n4\nclearance.5\nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1991, at the age of 17.  After high school and college,\nhe  worked for a number of companies as a consultant.  Since 2002, he has worked on a number of\ngovernment contracts.  He and his wife own two homes, and have various investments, including\n\nId. \n6\nId. at 19-20.\n7\nId. at 20.\n8\nId. at 22-23.\n9\nId. at 25-30.\n10\nId. at 32-33.\n11\nId. at 35-40.\n12\nId. at 18.\n13\n4\n401(k), stock and brokerage accounts, and they own nothing in a foreign country.  His parents, both\nphysicians (M.D.), are residents of and citizens of the U.S.   In addition to his parents, he has uncle\u2019s,\n6\ncousins, and other relatives living in the United States who are all U.S. citizens. \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother and grandfather are citizens and residents of The Peoples Republic\nof China (PRC).  His grandfather was a college professor at a private university, and receives a\npension from the university.  His grandmother was a housewife.  .  His grandparents are nearly 90\n7\nyears old, have been retired for nearly 30 years, and both have major health problems.  He talks to\nthem two or three times a year to check on their health. \nHis mother-in-law, father- in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.\nHis father-in-law is a retired environmental scientist, who worked for a nonprofit institution.   His\n8\nmother-in-law is a patent attorney with offices in China and the U.S.  His brother-in-law was\neducated in Canada and the United Kingdom, and now works for a financial brokerage in China.9\nNone of his family had any association with the Chinese government or Communist Party.10\nBoth of his parent\u2019s families suffered political and economic disadvantages during the Cultural\nRevolution from 1966 to 1976.  His paternal grandparents were imprisoned, accused of spying for\nthe United States, as well as giving anti-government forces scientific data, because both were\nengineers.  His grandfather was not given his last chance to be with his mother when she died\nbecause he was in prison.  His parents, and an aunt  an uncle were forced to do heavy labor.  His\nfamily lost valuables, assets, and their pride.  His wife has told him similar stories.  He believes it\nis extremely unlikely that any family member, on both sides, would collaborate with the Chinese\ngovernment.   Applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. go back three generations.  A grandfather worked\n11\nas a translator for the U.S. Army during World War II.  Another fought along side Chiang Kai-shek.\nA great-uncle was a noted nuclear physicist that worked for the U.S. government.12\nApplicant traveled to China in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005.   In 2000, he traveled to see his\n13\ngrandparents, the first trip to see them since emigrating to the U.S.   The second, in 2002, was after\nhe married and the trip was to visit his in-laws and his grandmother on his mother\u2019s side, who was\nhaving serious health problems.  She helped raise him when he was young.  In 2004, he and his wife\ntook a leisurely trip to see southern China and also visit families.  In 2005, he took his daughter to\n\nId. at 44-45.\n14\nId. at 123-130.\n15\nGovernment Exhibit 2 (U.S. State Department, Background Note on China, dated January 2007) at 1-19.\n16\nGovernment Exhibit 3 (U. S.  State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China, 2006,) at 1-11.\n17\nGovernment Exhibit 4 (U. S.  House of Representatives report: US National Security and Military/Commercial\n18\nConcerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China, dated January 3, 1999) at 1-57.\n5\nvisit her great-grandparents.  He felt it was important for them to see the next generation.   He was\n14\nnever contacted by Chinese officials on any of his trips.\nApplicant\u2019s co-worker testified that Applicant leads their area of portfolio management, and\nis doing a very good job of keeping clients happy.  He believes Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and\nnot vulnerable to foreign influence, and recommends him for a clearance.15\nThe PRC is a very populous country, is economically powerful, and is an important trading\npartner of the United States.  It is run by the Communist Party which controls all aspects of the PRC\ngovernment.  It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign policy.  Although there has been\nsome cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United States in the past.  The PRC\nhas an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and space capability.  The PRC\nhas launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and nuclear bombs.  Its diplomatic\nand military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a possible military conflict,\nwhich the United States opposes as a resolution of the conflict.   The PRC has an abysmal human\n16\nrights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration without notice in mental\nfacilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial; a politically\ncontrolled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on religious freedom, on\nfreedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family, home or\ncorrespondence.   \n17\nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services.\nThis is believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries\nto identify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and\nsometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.  \n18\nThere is evidence that the PRC considers Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable to\napproach than any other group.  It is likely the PRC has adopted its distinctive ethnic-targeting\nintelligence strategy because it is much more capable of mounting effective approaches against\nindividuals of ethnic Chinese ancestry than those of any other background.  Also, the selling point\nin a normal PRC  recruitment operation is not an appeal to ethnicity per se, but to whatever feelings\nof obligation the targeted individual may have towards the PRC, family members in the PRC, old\nfriends in the PRC, etc.  The crux of the PRC\u2019s approach is not to try to exploit a perceived\nvulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help the PRC out in some way.  Whatever the\n\n Government Exhibit 7 (Intelligence Threat Handbook, dated June 2004) at 21.\n19\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n20\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n6\nreason, ethnic targeting to arouse feelings of obligation is the single most distinctive feature of the\nPRC intelligence operations.19\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines are\ndivided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.20\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n21\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n22\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n23\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n24\n7\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n22\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.23\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n24\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 6. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\n\n8\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nGuidelines \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nGuidelines \u00b6 8. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nThe government established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant admitted that his\ngrandmother and grandfather are citizens and residents of The Peoples Republic of China (PRC), that\nhis mother-in-law, father- in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC, and that\nhe traveled to China in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005.  In addition, common sense suggests that the\nstronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if\nthe relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign\nintelligence or security service.  Here, based on the record as a whole, Applicant has close family ties\nto the PRC, as evidenced by his parents and in-laws living in the PRC.  The strength of the ties is\nalso demonstrated by Applicant traveling to the PRC for family visits four times between 2000 and\n2005. \nApplicant\u2019s relatives living in China do not meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d\nunder 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b).  Similarly, they would not be considered as an\n\u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The\navailable evidence indicates they have no ties to or economic dependence upon the PRC government.\nThe test is whether Applicant  will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nThe federal statute, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), defines \u201cforeign power\u201d to include: a foreign government;\na faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly acknowledged by a foreign government to be\ncontrolled by that foreign government; a group engaged in international terrorism; a foreign-based\npolitical organization; or an entity directed and controlled by a foreign government.  The focus is not\nthe country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose.  The PRC is\nhostile to the U.S. and is ruled by a communist government with a poor record of human rights.\nApplicant is also the type of target favored by persons conducting intelligence gathering on behalf\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n25\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004).\n26\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3\n27\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\n9\nof the PRC.  With this history it is not difficult to envision a scenario in which Applicant\u2019s relatives\ncould be subjected to some or all of these arbitrary denials of basic human rights in an effort to put\npressure on Applicant to divulge classified information.  The PRC is actively pursuing industrial and\nmilitary intelligence in this country.  Given these circumstances - which are clearly beyond\nApplicant's control - the presence of Applicant's family in the PRC places them at risk of being\nbrought under control or used as a hostage by a PRC intelligence or security service.  The mere fact\nthat they live in the PRC means they are in a position where there is a potential for them to be\nexploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family members and\nthe interests of the U.S.  Accordingly, Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security\nconcern using the Guidelines \u00b6 8 (a) standard.\nUnder the mitigating condition of Guidelines \u00b6 8 (b) there is no conflict of interest because\nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  He is a third generation of\nhis family to become a U.S. citizen.  He was educated in the U.S.  Most of his family are U.S.\ncitizens.  He owns property here, and none in China.  He has a 401(k) plan, stock investments, rental\nreal estate in addition to his home.  His immediate family members in China are for the most part\nelderly and in poor health.  He has minimal contact with them.  His contact with his grandparents\nis showing them the respect that they are entitled to, and inquiring about their health, and telling\nthem about their great-grandchildren should not be misconstrued as somehow compromising his\nability to keep classified information confidential.  \nWhole Person Concept\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\u2013not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions\u2013is the\nheart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the Appeal\n25\nBoard has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant where no\nspecific mitigating conditions apply.26\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  The Directive specifically\nrequires each administrative judge to consider all the facts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual case.  To ignore such evidence would establish\na virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any person with ties to persons in a foreign\ncountry, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.  Under the former Guidelines, the Appeal Board\nhas held that \u201calthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may\npreclude the favorable application of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable\napplication of the relevant general factors.\u201d27\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n28\n10\nApplicant takes his duties seriously, and has demonstrated the self-discipline generally\nrequired for academic and career achievement.  He exercises sound judgment.  I find he is capable\nof maintaining, over a long period of time, a stable, loyal relationship with the U.S. government.  He\nhas shown an ability to cooperate, accommodate, and be part of his employer\u2019s team.  I find the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.28\nI had the opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and\ndeportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness,\nread his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those\naround him.  It is my impression Applicant's explanations are both consistent and sincere, and have\nthe solid resonance of truth.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and\nexplanation, successfully mitigated and refuted the Government's case in this regard\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He has lived in the\nU.S. since 1987. His parents, brother, and sister are citizens and residents of Taiwan. He telephones\nhis parents about once or twice a month. He has less frequent contact with his siblings. Earlier this\nyear, Applicant renounced his Taiwanese citizenship, and submitted his passport toward\naccomplishing that goal. Applicant has strong ties to the U.S., including a child born in the U.S. He\nobtained his master\u2019s education here. He has ties to his community, including investment in real\nestate, retirement plans, and bank accounts. Applicant has successfully mitigated the security\nconcerns related to foreign preference and foreign influence. Clearance is granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated March 29, 2004, which is unsigned). The SF 86 had a handwritten\n1\nnote \u201c0-7-05 re-cert.\u201dThe Government stated that Applicant recertified the accuracy of this information as of that date.\nSee Tr. 28.\nId. at 1.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 29, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86), which is unsigned.  On December 19, 2006, the Defense Office of\n1\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and\nmodified. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether\na clearance should be granted or revoked.\nIn a sworn, written statement, dated January 3, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on February 10, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 26, 2007. The hearing\nwas conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered three exhibits, Exs. 1-3.\nApplicant offered 27 exhibits, Exs. A-Z, and AA. All exhibits were admitted into the record without\nobjections. Prior to the hearing, the Government submitted 12 documents requesting that I take\nadministrative notice of them. At the hearing, these documents were not objected to by Applicant\nand they were all admitted into the record, marked as Exs. I-XII. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non March 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline\nC, subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. He also admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence\nunder Guideline B, subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. He denied the factual allegation under subparagraph 1.c. After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 44 years old and has been employed as a senior software engineer by a defense\ncontractor since April 2003.

In 1987, Applicant attended a well-known university in the U.S. and was awarded a\n5\nmaster\u2019s of science degree in June 1990.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1998.\n6\n7\nHe is married and has one child, who was born in the U.S. in February 1998.8\nApplicant exercised dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S. On November 6, 1998, he was\nissued a valid U.S. passport. On or about December 30, 2002, he was issued a Taiwanese passport,\nwhich expires December 10, 2012. He stated that his 2002 passport is a replacement of a previous\npassport, issued in December 1996 and expired December 10, 2012. In 1999, he visited Taiwan. He\nused his U.S. passport on that trip.9\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His parents are both\nretired and spend their time watching television and doing grocery shopping.  His parents did not\n10\ncomplete their elementary school education. They sold mushrooms in a local market for a living\nthroughout their life.  His brother, who lives in Taiwan, helps to support them.  They receive no\n11\n12\nTaiwan government pension nor do they have connections to the Taiwan government.  Applicant\n13\ntestified: \u201cI talk to my mother once or maybe twice a month to check on her health and my father\u2019s\nhealth. My father has high blood pressure. It\u2019s usually a conversation about two minutes.\u201d  He sends\n14\nhis parents about $600 per year to assist with their expenses.\n\nEx.

His sister is a senior\nmarketing director of a music company since April 2006.  From July 2005 to March 2006, she\n15\nowned her own flower design business. From June1998 to June 2005, she worked for various music\nfirms in Taiwan. Since November 1998, his brother is chief of a company that makes games.16\nPreviously, from July 1989 to November 1997, he was a coordinator at a graphics company. Neither\nof his siblings has  worked for the Taiwan government.  Applicant talks to his siblings about once\n17\nor twice a year.18\nOn January 31, 2007, Applicant wrote a letter to the U.S. Taipei Economic and Cultural\nRepresentative Office. In that letter, he renounced his Taiwanese citizenship, and submitted his\npassport toward accomplishing that goal.19\nApplicant has strong ties to the U.S. Not only did he receive his master\u2019s degree from a well-\nknown U.S. university, he owns real estate in the U.S.  He has bank accounts and retirement funds\n20\nin the U.S.  He also contributes to community organizations.  He is registered to vote and has\n21\n22\nserved as a juror in his local Circuit Court.  He has opened an education savings account for his\n23\ndaughter, as well as a prepaid college trust.  He does not have any financial or business interests in\n24\nTaiwan.\nApplicant submitted a character letter from a person who has known him through work since\nApril 2003. His friend found Applicant to be a very hard-working, respectable, and trustworthy\nindividual, who is honest and possesses \u201chigh integrity.\u201d25\nThe government of Taiwan is an ally and conducts trade with the U.S. Taiwan is a stable\ndemocracy, and it has a strong and well-developed economy. The threat of economic and industrial\nespionage continues to be a matter of concern for the U.S. Foreign countries continue to target the\nU.S. to illegally obtain critical technology. Foreign collectors operate against U.S. economic\ninterests. In 2000, Taiwan was one of the eight most active collectors of foreign economic\n\nEx.

There is no information showing that Taiwan\nexploits, harasses or pressures its citizens in an attempt to garner economic or industrial\ninformation.26\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n27\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n28\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n29\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.30\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.31\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n32\nId.\n33\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n34\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n35\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n32\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n33\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n34\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n35\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nForeign Preference\nUnder Guideline C, a security risk may exist when an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S. Such a person may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S. Applicant became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1998. He possessed a passport from Taiwan that was to expire in 2012. He\nwas in the Taiwan military while he lived there before immigrating to the U.S. and becoming a\nnaturalized citizen. Moreover, his college education was obtained in Taiwan after he fulfilled his\nmilitary obligation, and before he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He attended a university in the\nU.S. to obtain his master\u2019s degree. He does not have any financial or business interests in Taiwan.\nThus, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)(1) (possession of a current foreign\npassport) applies. Moreover, FP DC 10(a)(2) (military service or a willingness to bear arms for a\nforeign country), FP DC 10(a)(3) (accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country), and FP DC 10(a)(5) (using foreign citizenship to protect\nfinancial or business interests in another country) do not apply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate a security concerning regarding foreign preference. On January\n31, 2007, Applicant renounced his Taiwanese citizenship and surrendered his passport to the U.S.\nTaipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. He last traveled to Taiwan in 1999 and used his\nU.S. passport. Thus, Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC) 11(a) (dual citizenship is\nbased solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country), FP MC 11(b) (the individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship), and FP MC 11(e) (the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) apply.\nAccordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.c of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nForeign Influence\n\n7\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or a\ngovernment in a way that is not in the interests of the U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Applicant\u2019s parents, sister, and brother are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nConsequently, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion) applies.\nVarious factors can mitigate the foreign influence security concern. Even though he possessed\na valid Taiwan passport, when Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 1999, he used his U.S. passport. He\nhad since renounced his Taiwan citizenship and surrendered his passport. He has monthly telephone\ncalls with his parents. His parents are retired and do not receive a pension from the Taiwan\ngovernment. His sister and brother work for private companies that are not affiliated with the Taiwan\ngovernment. He talks to his siblings no more than once or twice a year. Moreover, the fact that his\nparents, sister, and brother are citizens and residents of Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable\nsecurity risk. For the past 20 years, Applicant has developed strong ties to the U.S., which include real\nestate ownership, bank accounts and retirement plans, and a daughter born here. Applicant has a\nprofession here that he is extremely proud of. He votes and serves jury duty. It is highly unlikely that\nApplicant would jeopardize his relationships and loyalties in the U.S. in any way. Applicant can be\ntrusted to resolve any conflict of interest with relatives in Taiwan in favor of the U.S. Thus, Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons,\nthe country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.) and FI MC 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) apply. Accordingly,\nallegations 2.a through 2.c of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Applicant is a mature individual who has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years. He has\nstrong ties to this country, which include his education, real estate, bank and retirement accounts. His\ndaughter is a U.S. citizen by birth, and he is already saving and planning her higher education in the\nU.S. Applicant credibly testified that the U.S. is his home. Applicant can be trusted to resolve any\nconflict of interest with relatives in Taiwan in favor of the U.S. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\npotential security concerns arising from his personal ties to Taiwan.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

More of a track\nrecord of demonstrated abstinence is required to overcome his history of drug use, given he used\nmarijuana in September 2005 after he had purportedly made a conscious decision in August 2003\nto cease his involvement as it was incompatible with his career and national security. Personal\nconduct concerns persist because of the poor judgment exercised over several years in using illegal\ndrugs knowing it was against the law and his employer's policy to do so. Clearance is denied.\n\nBoth parties understood the reference to be to hallucinogenic mushrooms.\n1\nSOR \u00b6 1.g was amended at the hearing to correct the date of his arrest, as reflected in the court records\n2\nsubmitted as Ex. 8.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 23, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR\non February 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on May 9, 2007. \nI convened a hearing on August 22, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Five government exhibits\n(Exs. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8) were admitted. The government initially offered as one exhibit several court and\npolice records pertaining to different offenses, including some not alleged in the SOR. The\ndocuments were marked separately for identification as Exs. 4-8, and those records that were not\nrelevant to allegations in the SOR (marked as Exs. 4, 5, and 6) were subsequently withdrawn.\nApplicant's case consisted of his testimony and six exhibits (Exs. A-F). DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript on September 5, 2007.\nThe record was held open until September 5, 2007, for Applicant to submit the results of a\nhair sample submitted by Applicant for drug testing on August 16, 2007. Applicant timely forwarded\na one-page medical review officer report dated August 29, 2007, to which the government had no\nobjections. Accordingly, the document was marked and admitted into evidence as Exhibit G.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency\nfrom about 1984 to at least September 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), purchased marijuana (\u00b6 1.b), used cocaine\nwith varying frequency from approximately 1987 to at least 2003 (\u00b6 1.c), purchased cocaine (\u00b6 1.d),\nused \u201cmushrooms\u201d in about 1985 (\u00b6 1.e),  was arrested in January 1987 for minor transporting\n1\nalcohol and possession of class D controlled substance (both dismissed) (\u00b6 1.f), served six months\nprobation for possession of class D controlled substance following an arrest for minor transporting\nalcohol, possession of class D controlled substance, and possession of class D controlled substance\nwith intent to distribute in October 1987 (\u00b6 1.g).  DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant\n2\nfalsified a February 1994 sworn statement in that denied he had used illegal drugs other than\nmarijuana and mushrooms (\u00b6 2.a). Applicant was also alleged under Guideline E and cross-alleged\nunder Guideline H (\u00b6 1.h) to have used marijuana and cocaine while he held a security clearance\ngranted in March 2001 (\u00b6 2.b), used marijuana in September 2005 after he applied for a clearance\n\n4\nin August 2005 (\u00b6 2.c), and used illegal drugs after he told a DoD investigator in February 1994 that\nhe had no intent to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future (\u00b6 2.d).\nApplicant admitted the allegations with one correction to SOR \u00b6 1.b. He indicated he had\nused marijuana and cocaine while holding a security clearance granted in 1994 instead of March\n2001, ceasing all involvement in August 2003 but for smoking a small amount of marijuana on one\noccasion in September 2005. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following additional\nfindings.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old product manager who has worked for his employer, a defense\ncontractor, since April 2003. He seeks to retain the secret-level security clearance that he has held\nfor his present duties.\nApplicant began to use illegal drugs as a 15-year-old high school sophomore in about 1984.\nHe first smoked marijuana when socializing with friends from his neighborhood. He was\nuncomfortable as he knew he wasn\u2019t doing the right thing, but succumbed to peer pressure and some\ncuriosity. Applicant did not like the drug\u2019s effects. A few weeks later, he tried it again due to peer\npressure. He smoked marijuana thereafter about twice a month for one year. During his last two years\nof high school, he used marijuana two to three times weekly, predominantly on weekends. Applicant\nwas provided the marijuana by friends, but it cost him about $5.00 a month.\nApplicant also experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms once or twice at age 16. He was\ngiven them while he and two friends were out \u201ccarousing\u201d in a friend\u2019s vehicle. Applicant\ncontributed a nominal amount for the drug. Applicant expected a \u201cmind-altering\u201d experience but the\ndrug\u2019s effects fell short of his expectations.\nDuring his junior year of high school, Applicant tried cocaine at a party. He used the drug\nabout ten times total in high school, contributing towards its cost once or twice but he never actively\nsolicited the drug. Applicant was aware his cocaine use was illegal, and he worried about getting\ncaught.\nWhile attending a hockey game in January 1987, Applicant and a companion were invited\nby a friend to smoke marijuana in his truck. Responding to a complaint of three young males\ndrinking beer in the vehicle, a local police officer stopped them. Applicant and the operator of the\nvehicle were arrested. Applicant was charged with minor transporting alcohol in a motor vehicle and\npossession of a class D substance. His case was continued without a finding to August 1987 on\npayment of $65 costs on the alcohol charge. Applicant admits he had been smoking marijuana in the\ntruck.\nIn October 1987, during his first semester in college, Applicant and the same friend were\nsitting in his friend\u2019s parked truck when a local police officer observed Applicant\u2019s companion drop\na can of beer out of the window. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol emitting from the\ntruck. The officer confiscated three full cans of beer under the passenger\u2019s seat and marijuana from\nunder the driver\u2019s seat. Applicant and his friend were both arrested for minor in possession of\nalcohol. His friend was also arrested on charges of  possession of class D substance and possession\nwith intent to distribute class D substance. During the booking procedure, Applicant was also\n\n5\ncharged with the marijuana offenses due to his constructive possession. Applicant pleaded not guilty\nto all three charges. In January 1988, he was convicted of illegal possession of class D substance,\nand placed on probation to June 1988 on payment of $15 costs. He was assessed additional costs of\n$60 on the alcohol charge. The possession of class D substance with intent to distribute charge was\ndismissed on motion of the complainant. In June 1988, his case was dismissed.\nIn college, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use declined to once every six months or so at parties with\nfriends. His grades had suffered in high school due to his use of marijuana, and he wanted to make\na fresh start. He refrained from any cocaine use in college. Applicant lived on campus his first\nsemester, but commuted from home during the remainder of college due to financial constraints and\nhis father\u2019s illness. In June 1992, Applicant earned his bachelor of science in mechanical\nengineering.\nIn March 1993, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a mechanical engineer.\nIn application for a secret-level security clearance, Applicant executed a National Agency\nQuestionnaire (DD Form 398-2) on or about September 21, 1993. In response to whether he had ever\nbeen arrested, charged, or cited for any offense, Applicant listed his two previous arrests on\nmarijuana charges, indicating that he had pleaded guilty to 1987 charges of minor in possession of\nalcohol and possession of marijuana. He also answered \u201cYes\u201d to drug/alcohol use and mental health\ninquiries, including question 30.a [\u201cHave you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include\nheroin or cocaine), depressant (to include quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or\nPCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish, or any mind-altering substance (to include glue\nor paint) even one-time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d],\nand question 30.b [\u201cHave you ever been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking,\nproduction, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis?\u201d].\n On February 10, 1994, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security\nService (DSS) about his arrest record as a minor and his alcohol and drug abuse history. Concerning\nhis illegal drug involvement, Applicant indicated in a signed, sworn statement that he had used\nmarijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Starting at age 15, he smoked marijuana twice monthly\nwith friends. At age 16 or 17, his use increased to twice weekly, but he reported it \u201csubsided\nsignificantly\u201d at 18. He disclosed that from age 18 to 23, he smoked marijuana once every six\nmonths. Applicant indicated that he used mushrooms once when he was 16 out of curiosity and peer\npressure. Applicant denied use of any other illegal drug. He claimed a last usage of marijuana on\nDecember 31, 1992 (\u201cI stopped it and no longer get enjoyment from it.\u201d Ex. 3), and indicated he did\nnot intend to use marijuana, mushrooms, or any other illegal drug in the future. Applicant denied any\ninvolvement in the sale of marijuana and any current, \u201cregular\u201d association with drug users.\nApplicant did not disclose that he had used cocaine in high school because of the stigma attached\nto the use of cocaine, his embarrassment and shame over that use, and concern that it could affect\nhis future if his employer learned of it.\nIn about March 1994, Applicant was granted his secret clearance. Although Applicant had\nno intent to use any illegal drug again as of February 1994, he used marijuana and cocaine several\ntimes while he worked for the defense contractor and knowing that the company had a policy that\nprohibited illicit drug use by its employees. As to when he resumed his involvement, Applicant\nrecalls with respect to both drugs, \u201cprobably one, or two or three years later.\u201d (Tr. 98) Applicant used\ncocaine five times from March 1994 to August 1997, and ten more times until his last use in August\n\nThe government alleged that Applicant was granted a security clearance on March 29, 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but\n3\nthere is no evidence that the clearance was granted on that date. Applicant did not need a clearance for his duties from\nApril 2001 until he was hired by his present employer in April 2003. (Tr. 101) It is not clear when his clearance was\nreinstated. His SF 86 was not even filled out until about September 2004.\n6\n2003. Applicant used the cocaine with some of the friends with whom he had previously used\nmarijuana and with new friends. Applicant used marijuana five times from August 1997 to August\n2003. He purchased small amounts of marijuana on two occasions between 1999 and 2001, at least\nonce while he held a security clearance for his work with a previous employer.\nFrom about 1997 to 2001, Applicant worked on a radar program. During the requirements\ndefinition stage, he was instrumental in establishing relationships with numerous naval\norganizations. As the ship integration lead, Applicant was responsible for presenting the design\nduring preliminary and critical design reviews and they were rated as exceptional by the military\ncustomer. \nFrom April 2001 to April 2003. Applicant did not require a security clearance. Employed for\nthe first ten months in the development and support of wireless infrastructure, Applicant stayed on\nafter the company was acquired and in February 2002 was given program management\nresponsibilities for his new employer.\nApplicant was unemployed from about January 2003 to April 2003, when he returned to the\ndefense sector as a product manager (maritime) for his present employer.\nIn early 2003, Applicant\u2019s\n3\nsignificant other, whom he met in late 1999, moved in with Applicant and his then roommate. She\nhad previously observed Applicant to have an active social life but did not suspect any illegal drug\nuse on his part. He began to spend more time with her, and in August 2003, they purchased a home\ntogether in a neighboring state. Applicant then resolved to discontinue any illegal drug use\npermanently (\u201cSimply put, it was time for a man in his mid-thirties with a wonderful supportive\nfamily who depends on him and a successful career to \u2018grow up\u2019.\u201d see Answer). His significant other\nhas since seen a \u201cprofound shift\u201d in his social habits, almost never seeing any of his old friends (see\nEx. E). \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2004, and on October 29,\n2004, signed a release authorizing the government to obtain information related to his activities.\nApplicant reported that he used marijuana and cocaine within the preceding seven years, marijuana\nfive times form August 1997 to August 2003, and cocaine ten times from August 1997 to August\n2003. Concerning any use of illegal drugs in a sensitive position, Applicant indicated that he had\nused marijuana only the five times but had used cocaine 15 times from March 1994 to August 2003.\nApplicant responded \u201cYes\u201d as well to whether he had been involved in the illegal purchase,\nmanufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of an illegal drug within\nthe last seven years, but provided no details. The form was incomplete, and it was returned to\nApplicant for further information. Applicant then added that he had purchased small amounts of\nmarijuana (less than 1/16 ounce) twice during the approximate time frame of 1999 to 2001.Applicant\nre-signed the form on August 17, 2005.\nIn September 2005, Applicant smoked marijuana on one occasion with two friends. He has\nknown one of the friends since he was six years of age (\u201cWell, he was smoking it with another friend\n\n7\nof mine that was up for the weekend as well and, you know, in a moment of weakness, I partook in\nthat activity, so he didn\u2019t take it out for my expressed purposes.\u201d Tr. 128). Applicant knew it was\nagainst his employer\u2019s policy to smoke illegal drugs. Applicant, who had used cocaine and marijuana\nwith this friend in the past, told him that he hadn\u2019t used an illegal drug in two plus years.\nIn May 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He told the\ninvestigator that he had a \u201cdon\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell policy\u201d with his mother and his significant other about\nhis illegal drug use. He also told the investigator that he could not say that he would not use any\nillegal drug again, but he did not intend to use any illegal drug.\nAfter that interview, Applicant received the SOR, which led him to realize the \u201cgravity of\n[his] previous indiscretions.\u201d (Tr. 112) He disclosed his past illegal drug involvement to his\nsignificant other and resolved to not use any illegal drug in the future. As of August 2007, Applicant\nand his significant other were planning to have a child and Applicant\u2019s career was \u201creally beginning\nto take off.\u201d (Tr. 124). He realizes future drug use is inconsistent with those plans.\nIn late Spring 2007, Applicant got together with the close friend with whom he smoked\nmarijuana in September 2005. Applicant did not use marijuana and his friend did not offer him any\nin Spring 2007. Applicant does not know whether this friend is still using marijuana. Applicant\nintends to maintain a relationship  with his \u201cvery dear, old friend,\u201d whom he sees maybe three times\na year, usually in a couples situation. Applicant no longer associates with the others with whom he\nused cocaine or marijuana in the past. He now looks at illegal drug use as immature and immoral.\nOn August 16, 2007, Applicant submitted a hair sample for drug testing with the\nunderstanding that hair follicle testing covers a lengthier period (three or four months) than a\nurinalysis (\u201cthe last several days, or a week or whatever it is,\u201d Tr. 118). The test results were negative\nfor all substances tested, i.e., amphetamines, marijuana, phencyclidine, cocaine, opiates). (Ex. G)\nApplicant is willing to submit to random drug test and monitoring to verify his continued abstinence.\nApplicant is subject to drug testing at his current job, but only if he is suspected of substance abuse.\nApplicant has been a dependable and reliable employee. He has been willing to stay late to\nget the job done, and has met his employer\u2019s expectations since he started. His recent evaluation for\n2006 indicates that he has upheld ethical standards at work and has followed through with his\ncommitments, dependable where the assignment is well-defined.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\n\n8\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises\nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG\n\u00b6 24). Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs, materials, and\nother chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). (AG\n\u00b6 24(a)(1)). Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates\nfrom approved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24(b)).\nApplicant smoked marijuana about once to twice monthly during his sophomore year in high\nschool. During his last two years of high school, he smoked marijuana twice weekly, snorted cocaine\nten times, and tried hallucinogenic mushrooms once or twice. In college, he used marijuana about\ntwice a year, including on one occasion during his first semester where it led to his arrest. After he\nwas granted a secret-level clearance in 1994 for his duties with a previous employer, he resumed his\ncocaine use in a mix of old and new friends, using it five times over the next three years and ten\ntimes more from August 1998 to August 2003. He refrained from any use of marijuana until about\nAugust 1997, but used it five times to August 2003 and once in September 2005. Applicant\ncontributed to the cost of the cocaine and marijuana he used on occasion. He purchased small\namounts of marijuana in 1999 and 2001. Drug involvement disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 25(a),\nany drug abuse, \u00b6 25(c), illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), and \u00b6 25(g), any illegal drug\nuse after being granted a security clearance, apply.\nFurthermore, when Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2006,\nhe could not state that he would never use illegal drugs again, although he denied any general intent\nto use illegal drugs in the future. While he now suggests that he meant nothing more than he could\nnot be 100 percent sure about anything in life (Tr. 121), it is more likely that Applicant was candidly\nacknowledging the possibility of future drug involvement on his part when socializing with friends,\neven though he had no intent at the time to use drugs. When initially confronted at his hearing about\nhis unwillingness or inability to commit to a drug-free future in May 2006, Applicant did not deny\ntelling the investigator that he could not state he would never use drugs again. Instead, he explained\n\n9\nit was no longer his position, and that the clearance appeals process had opened his eyes to the\ngravity of his previous \u201cindiscretions.\u201d (Tr. 112) His failure to rule out future illicit drug\ninvolvement, in the context of a history of drug use after he had expressed an intent to not use any\ndrugs in the future, raises concerns under the second prong of DC \u00b6 25(h), failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. Despite the limited evidence of drug abuse in recent\nyears (in the past four years one occasion of marijuana use), Applicant bears a heavy burden to\ndemonstrate that his drug involvement is safely in the past.\nApplicant\u2019s case for favorable consideration of mitigating condition \u00b6 26(a), the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment, is not persuasive. Although the heaviest of his drug use occurred when he was a minor,\nhis drug use cannot reasonably be characterized on the whole as infrequent. He used cocaine 15\ntimes after being granted a clearance in 1994. Moreover, his last use of marijuana in September 2005\nwas relatively recent and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.\nRealizing that his conduct has raised legitimate concerns about his commitment to not use\nillegal drugs in the future  (see Answer), Applicant took several steps that he submits demonstrate\nthe intent not to abuse any drugs in the future required under MC \u00b6 26(b). Applicant has terminated\nhis relationships with those former friends with whom he had used illegal drugs in the past with the\nexception of a very dear friend whom he has known since he was six. (see \u00b6 26(b)(1) disassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts). He moved away from the old environment and\nassociations in August 2003, purchasing a home with his significant other in another locale and\nfocusing on their life together (see 26(b)(2), changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused). He has been abstinent for the last two years, and for two years more before he used marijuana\nin September 2005 (see 26(b)(3), an appropriate period of abstinence). Going beyond a signed\nstatement of intent (see 26(b)(4), a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance\nfor any violation, Applicant volunteered to submit to a random drug testing program at his own\nexpense under conditions imposed by the Department of Defense to prove his abstention. His first\nhair follicle sample taken on August 16, 2007, was  negative for the illegal drugs tested.\n As noted by Department Counsel, most of the changes in circumstances (friends, relocation)\nand even dedication to his significant other and career did not preclude him from using the marijuana\nin September 2005. Applicant indicated that he and his significant other have been attempting to\nconceive a child for three years (Ex. A), so that also had no impact on his decision to smoke the\nmarijuana when it presented to him in September 2005. Applicant is not willing to give up his\nfriendship with the close friend with whom he smoked marijuana in September 2005, and both\nmarijuana and cocaine before that. He is also not aware whether this \u201cvery dear, old friend\u201d (Tr. 130)\nhas given up drugs (Tr. 108). Applicant has failed to provide adequate assurances that his ongoing\nassociation with this friend does not present a risk to him remaining drug free. Applicant sees this\nfriend only about three times a year, and no drugs were involved when they got together in Spring\n2007. Assuming Applicant was not pressured by his friend to use the marijuana in 2005 (\u201cWell, he\nwas smoking it with another friend of mine that was up for the weekend as well, and, you know, in\na moment of weakness, I partook in that activity, so he didn\u2019t take it out for my expressed purposes.\u201d\nTr. 128), it is still troubling that his friend used marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence when he knew\nApplicant had not used marijuana in some time and had resolved to stop using, as reflected in the\nfollowing exchange between myself and Applicant at the hearing:\n\n10\nQ When you used marijuana in 2005 did you tell him at that time that you were no\nlonger using any illegal drugs?\nA I probably told him that I hadn\u2019t used anything in whatever it was at the time, two\nplus years.\nQ Have you told him that you are not using any illegal drugs again or not?\nA Yes, yes, he is well aware of my abstinence, Your Honor.\nQ And when did you tell him that?\nA Probably at varying times over the last four years and he is well aware of the fact\nthat I don\u2019t do drugs anymore. (Tr. 127-28)\nConcerns persist as to whether this friend can be counted on to respect Applicant\u2019s change to a drug-\nfree lifestyle, or whether Applicant can counted on to do the right thing if drugs are used in his\npresence. When asked why he simply did not walk away when the marijuana was presented to him\nin September 2005, Applicant responded, \u201cIt was a moment of weakness, Your Honor, I was, it was\na holiday party weekend, if you will, and I had a moment of weakness, that\u2019s all I can attribute to it.\u201d\n(Tr. 129) Implicit in his decision to use on that occasion was that he wanted to experience the mood-\naltering effects of the drug.\nApplicant\u2019s offer of drug testing is consistent with an intent to abstain, but drug testing does\nnot have the same deterrent effect when there is no monitoring of test results, and it was a very recent\nresponse to the government\u2019s SOR. Based on all the circumstances presented, I am unable to\nconclude that his drug use is safely in the past.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant falsely denied he had used any\nillegal drugs other than marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms in a statement provided to a DSS\nagent in February 1994, as he feared the negative impact if it became known that he had used\ncocaine. He also told the agent he had outgrown marijuana and no longer got enjoyment from it, but\nhis subsequent use of the drug on six occasions raises considerable doubts as to the verity of that\nstatement as well. Under Guideline E, DC \u00b6 16(b), deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative, applies.\nApplicant also exercised poor judgment, raising concerns about his willingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, by using both marijuana and cocaine after he had told the DSS agent in\nFebruary 1994 that he had no intent of future drug use (SOR \u00b6 2.d) while he held a security clearance\nfor a previous employer from March 1994 to April 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), and by his use of marijuana\nonce in September 2005 after he had applied for his clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant also used\nmarijuana and cocaine in at least August 2003, after he had started working for his current employer.\nWhile it is not clear whether his clearance had been reinstated\u2014his latest clearance application was\nnot filled out until September 2004 and not submitted until one year later\u2014he used the illegal drugs\n\nThe evidence is insufficient to prove \u00b6 2.b, although Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs while employed by a\n4\ndefense contractor is certainly relevant to assessing whether he possesses the requisite good judgment that must be\ndemanded of those with access.\n11\nknowing that it was against his employer\u2019s policy to do so.  DC \u00b6 16(e), personal conduct, or\n4\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing, applies. Drug involvement in violation of an\nemployer\u2019s policy, if known, could well affect his job in some way. Applicant intentionally\nconcealed his cocaine use when he was interviewed in 1994 because of the stigma attached to\ncocaine and concern of the consequences to his employment if it became known. Moreover, DC \u00b6\n16(g), association with persons involved with criminal activity, also must be considered in the\nabsence of proof that his close friend no longer uses any illegal drugs.\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he was candid about his illegal drug involvement when he applied for\nhis current clearance. He also admitted to a government investigator when he was interviewed in\nMay 2006 that he could not state that he would never use illicit drugs again. These belated\ndisclosures were not prompt enough to mitigate his February 1994 false statements under \u00b6 17(a),\nthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts. Despite the passage of some 13 years since he falsified his\nFebruary 1994 sworn statement (see MC \u00b6 17(c), the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment), it remains relevant in that Applicant made no effort to correct the record for several years\nwhile he was in a fiduciary relationship with the government. Moreover,  his falsifications in 1994\ncannot be viewed in isolation from his repeated abuse of illegal drugs in knowing disregard of the\nlaw and policies prohibiting illegal drug use by employees. His excuse for that drug use, that he did\nnot consider it relevant in terms of affecting his ability to adequately safeguard classified information\n(Tr. 113), compounds the considerable doubt about whether he understands, and can be counted on\nto fulfill, his fiduciary obligations. It should not have taken the issuance of the SOR for Applicant,\nan engineer with a college degree and several years of experience in the defense sector, to appreciate\nthat use of illegal drugs was incompatible with a clearance.\nAgain, you know, this process of appeals and the very real risk of my security\nclearance being revoked and the implications it has on my life and career has further\nopened my eyes to the realization that any type of drug use is just a dead end and that\nthere is no, you know, there is no rhyme or reason or motivation for me to ever do it\nagain.\nPart of it is facing very real and, you know, very severe or very severe consequences\nas the result of doing it in the past, so you can chalk it up to a very valuable lesson\nlearned. (Tr. 121-22)\nFollowing his May 2006 interview, Applicant realized at least that he could no longer hide his illegal\ndrug abuse from his significant other, and he has disclosed the facts of his drug abuse to the\ngovernment, albeit belatedly. MC \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or\n\nApplicant used cocaine and marijuana after he had been granted a security clearance in 1994 and denied in\n5\nFebruary 1994 any intent to use illegal drugs in the future. That use of drugs is covered in \u00b6 2.d and an adverse finding\nis returned as to that allegation. Although Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.b, it was not proven that he was granted a\n12\neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, applies, but it is not enough to\novercome the considerable personal conduct concerns.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)).\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse, while at its most frequent when he was a minor, continued beyond\nthe age where it could no longer be attributed to immaturity. His involvement with marijuana and\ncocaine as a adult while employed by a defense contractor and knowing of its illegality (\u00b6 2(a)(3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct), raises considerable doubts as to whether he possesses the\ngood judgment and maturity that must be demanded of those with access (\u00b6 2(a)(4) the individual\u2019s\nage and maturity at the time of the conduct).  His current two years of abstinence, accompanied by\na sincere resolve to abstain, are not enough to overcome the drug involvement and personal conduct\nconcerns in this case. Even if I was to conclude that there was no risk of future drug involvement\npresented by his ongoing association with the close friend with whom he used marijuana in\nSeptember 2005, the combination of circumstances presented in this case supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment and unreliability (see \u00b6 2(d). It is simply not credible that he\ncould have failed to realize that his ongoing drug use was incompatible with his fiduciary\nobligations. He held the privilege of classified access knowing that his clearance had been granted\nbased on a lie about the extent of his illegal drug involvement. He made no effort at rectification\nuntil he had to regain his clearance for his present duties, and then used marijuana thereafter over\nLabor Day weekend in September 2005. When asked about his future intent in May 2006, Applicant\ncould not unequivocally state that he would never use drugs again..\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

While applying for a security clearance she learned that her husband lied to her about\nhis citizenship status. He is a citizen of Nigeria and remained in the U.S. after his student visa\nexpired. She was unaware of what his immigration status was until she sponsored him for permanent\nresidency. His application is still pending. Applicant\u2019s husband has financial interests and familial\nties to Nigeria, but she could not articulate the full extent of them. She has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B, foreign influence. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 30, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July\n18, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me\non August 16, 2007. I convened a hearing on September 5, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nGovernment offered two exhibits that were marked as GE 1-2, and admitted without objections.\nDepartment Counsel also offered six exhibits that were marked as HE I-VI and requested I take\nadministrative notice. Five of the six exhibits were from official publications. The sixth exhibit was\na brief. I took administrative notice of HE I-V and considered the content of HE VI. Applicant\ntestified on her behalf, had one witness testify, and offered one exhibit that was marked as AE A and\nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old personnel security adjudicator and has worked in this position for\na federal contractor since 2003. She was granted a secret security clearance in 2005. Applicant met\nher Nigerian born husband in 2002 while working at another job.

He attended college in the U.S.\n3\nand received both a two year and four year degree.  Applicant is unaware under what legal\n4\nimmigration status her husband remained in the U.S. after he completed his schooling and his\nstudent visa expired.  While they were dating she asked him if he was a U.S. citizen and he told her\n5\nyes he was a U.S. citizen.  She asked to see some documentation and he showed her what she\n6\nthought was a social security card and an identification card. Later when she was applying for a\nsecurity clearance in 2005, she requested he provide her with the documents to show his legal\nresidency status for her application and he was unable to do so because he did not have any.  He\n7\nadmitted he lied to her about his residency status. She stated she did not know he was not a U.S.\ncitizen until she requested the documents so she could obtain her security clearance. She voiced her\nconcern about him lying and failing to tell her about important matters, but said: \u201cI chose to forgive\nhim.\u201d  Since then she has petitioned for her husband to receive legal status in the U.S. as her spouse.\n8\n9\nThis petition was approved in March 2006 and affords her husband legal status in the U.S. He is not\nyet a permanent resident alien and is still a citizen of Nigeria.  Appellant testified that her husband\n10\nis an accountant, but did not articulate how he works in the U.S. legally without a green card. \nAppellant stated that she takes care of the finances because her husband is not responsible\nwhen it comes to handling money and does not tell her what he spends money on.  She believes her\n11\nnow deceased father-in-law sent her husband money and it went into their joint account, but the\nmoney was not for her benefit.  She stated her husband does not have access to her money which\n12\ngoes into a separate account.  They have a joint account with her credit union and she was required\n13\nto sponsor him so he could be on the account.14\n\nTr. 38.\n15\nTr. 39.\n16\nTr. 40.

Her mother-in-law and five sisters-in-law are all\n15\nresidents and citizens of Nigeria. Applicant testified her husband\u2019s parents were the King and Queen\nof a city in Nigeria.  She also believed upon the father\u2019s death, because Applicant\u2019s husband did not\n16\nsecede to the throne, the title was bestowed upon another family.  She also believed he was at one\n17\ntime attacked in his palace. She believed her father-in-law was also an engineer who worked for the\nNigerian Federal Ministry of Work and Housing.  One of her sisters-in-law is also employed by the\n18\nsame ministry, working in the housing area.  Applicant stated she does not know what assets her\n19\nhusband may have in Nigeria.  She says she was told that his mother gave him some land.  She was\n20\n21\nalso told that his siblings received an inheritance upon their father\u2019s death, but she does not know\nif her husband also received one.  She could not articulate where the land he received from his\n22\nmother is located or the value of it, but confirmed it was in Nigeria.  \n23\nApplicant met her future mother-in-law when she came to the U.S. to visit in 2002 and stayed\nwith them.  They were living together at the time. When Applicant and her husband married, four\n24\nof his sisters attended the wedding in the U.S.  They stayed for three to four days before returning\n25\nto Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-laww are married and some have children. He has aunts and uncles\nliving in Nigeria and Appellant estimates her husband has approximately 10 nieces and nephews also\nliving in Nigeria.  She is unaware of what her sisters-in-law\u2019s husbands do for employment. She is\n26\nuncertain, except for the one sister-in-law, as to if the others are employed and what they do.  In\n27\naddition to their wedding visit, one sister stopped for a two day visit while in the U.S. to attend a\nconference. Another sister visited over Thanksgiving one year for a day. When Applicant talks to\nher sisters-in-law it is usually through phone calls her husband is having with them, not ones she\ninitiates. She is uncertain how often he calls them, but minimally it is for special occasions, such as\n\nTr. 43-45, 75.\n28\nTr. 75-76.\n29\nTr. 119-120.\n30\nHE 1.\n31\nHe 2 at 1; HE 1 at 2-3.\n32\nHE 1 at 37, HE 2 at 1-14.\n33\nHE 2 at 2-3.\n34\nHE IV at 1.\n35\nHE V at 1. \n36\nId. at 1-2.\n37\nId.\n38\n5\nbirthdays and anniversaries.  She admits she has corresponded with her in-laws through emails and\n28\nestimated it is between 20-45 emails a year. She testified that her husband feels affection towards\nhis family, but she does not. She does not know how much contact he has with them.  Applicant is\n29\nunsure if her husband has any friends in Nigeria. Applicant does not intend of traveling to Nigeria\nin the future. She is uncertain if her husband intends on traveling there in the future. \nApplicant works as a security adjudicator for a federal contractor. She screens applications\nof potential employees seeking jobs in sensitive areas that need some type of clearance. The\nguidelines she uses to make a recommendation whether a potential employee should receive a\nclearance are very similar to those used in this proceeding.

Her supervisor\ncommented that she strictly follows the adjudicative guidelines when considering employees and\ndoes not deviate from them.  \n30\nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa with a population of approximately 140 million\nand the most populous African nation.  Since gaining independence Nigeria has experienced\n31\npolitical instability and economic crisis.  The political landscape has been dominated by military\n32\ncoups and long military-imposed transition programs.  It has been under civilian rule since 1999.\n33\n34\nThe Nigerian government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the government at all levels\ncontinues to commit serious human rights abuses.

Americans are\n36\nwarned against traveling in Nigeria.  Violent crime is committed by ordinary criminals and police\n37\nand others in military uniforms.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n46\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n47\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.48\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\n49\n\nSee v.

An applicant \u201cas\n52\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n53\non the side of denial.\u201d54\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\nunfavorable. The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly within the interests of national\nsecurity. \nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nForeign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) and\nespecially FI DC 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\n\n8\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), FI DC\n7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict\nof interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information), FI DC\n7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion),\nand FI DC 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk\nof foreign influence or exploitation). Applicant\u2019s husband, with whom she lives with in the U.S. is\na citizen of Nigeria. He lied to her about his citizenship status and she has concerns about him telling\nher important things. It appears he was living illegally in the U.S. after his student visa expired. She\nhas since sponsored him for permanent residency status. Her contact with her husband is obviously\nclose and his deceptive conduct creates a potential conflict of interest between her obligation and\ndesire to help her husband and her obligation to protect sensitive information. In addition, Appellant\nsimply did not know certain information about her husband that raises security  concerns. She knows\nhe owns property in Nigeria, but was unaware of where it is, how much, and its value. She believes\nhe likely inherited something from his father, but was unaware of what it was or its value. She does\nnot know if he has friends still in Nigeria. She knows he communicates regularly with his family,\nbut does not know how often they talk or email. She knows one of her sisters-in-law works for the\nNigerian government, but was unaware of what the specifics of her job entailed. She also was only\nvaguely aware of the others\u2019 employment and did not know how their husbands were employed.\nBecause there was a void in information about her in-laws and because of her husband\u2019s relationship\nwith his family an increased risk is raised. I find all of the above FI DC apply to the facts.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) especially (FI\nMC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with the foreign person, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), FI MC (b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest), FI MC 8(c) (contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation), FI MC 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business,\nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual). Applicant obviously has a close\nrelationship with her husband. She does not with her in-laws and was unfamiliar with many things\nabout them. I conclude that her contact and communication with her is-laws in casual and infrequent\nand is mitigated under FI MC 8(c). However, her contact with her husband creates a conflict of\ninterest. She has already demonstrated a profound sense of loyalty to her husband when she forgave\nhim for lying to her about a very serious matter and then chose to sponsor him for legal status.\nAlthough she has a loyalty to the U.S. that is not questioned, I cannot find that there is little\nlikelihood that she would resolve any conflict of interest in favor or the U.S. It is just too great of\na burden to presume she would choose her country over her husband. Although her husband has\nlived in the U.S. since the 1990s he still has very strong ties to Nigeria and his family there. He owns\n\nAppellant\u2019s husband\u2019s financial interest in Nigeria was not alleged as a security concern and will not be\n55\nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, but it will be considered in evaluating the \u201cwhole\u201d person.\n9\nproperty and it is unknown what his intentions are for returning.  I have also considered the political\n55\nclimate in Nigeria as it relates to a heightened security risk and conclude that although it is a country\nwith ties to the U.S. the instability of the country increases the security risk factors. After considering\nall of the evidence I find none of the other FI MC apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nDirective to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances;\n(2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or\nabsence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nGuidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI have weighed all of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, foreign\ninfluence and evaluated all the evidence in the context of the whole person. I considered that\nApplicant was quite unfamiliar with her husband\u2019s family background, ties to his family, and\nfinancial ties to Nigeria. I also considered that her husband lied to her about his immigration status\nand she does not have complete confidence that he tells her important information. These factors\nmake her especially vulnerable. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based\non Guideline B, foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nApplicant answered the SOR on February 23, 2007 and requested a hearing. \nI was assigned the case on March 30, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30,\n2007, scheduling it for June 15, 2007. During the hearing, I received six government exhibits, three\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony.  At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the\nclose of the hearing  to allow him to submit additional exhibits.

In May 1993, he obtained a weekend pass to visit her in an attempt to\nsave their marriage, and stayed longer than authorized.  He was later arrested.\n6\nA subsequent investigation revealed that he had written bad checks in the amount of $765,\nwhich he used to purchase items on base.  He was charged with larceny and being absent without\n7\nofficial leave.  Consequently, he was orally admonished and given a general discharge under\n8\nhonorable conditions.9\nIn 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with one felony count of writing a bad check,\nand one misdemeanor count of writing a bad check.  He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, and on\n10\nJune 28, 1995, was sentenced to 60 days in prison with 55 suspended, and ordered to pay restitution\nwithin six months of the order. He did not pay the restitution until 2002.11\nApplicant separated from his first wife in 1994, and moved to another state. Shortly\nafterwards, she filed for divorce. The  court finalized the divorce in October 1995. In approximately\nSeptember 1996, his ex-wife obtained a court order for him to pay child support. Applicant testified\nthat he \u201cdidn\u2019t know that she was going to file for child support\u201d  when they separated, and did not\n12\nknow of the order until he received a notice of wage garnishment in September 2002. By this time,\nhe was approximately $15,000 in arrears.  He remained in contact with his wife and children after\n13\nthe separation.14\nSince September 2002, he has been paying consistently through the garnishment.  Also, all\n15\nof Applicant\u2019s income tax returns are applied toward the arrearage.\n\nSee note 12 at 3.\n16\nLetter from Creditor, dated February 23, 2007, as listed in Answer at 7.\n17\nAnswer at 1, Exhibit D, Letter from Creditor, dated June25, 2007, at 2.\n18\n4\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has remarried. In 2001, Applicant relinquished his parental rights to\nenable his children\u2019s stepfather to adopt them. Since then, he has not been responsible for any\nprospective child support. The current balance of the arrearage is $12,000.16\nAs of January 2007, Applicant owed a credit card company $377. He paid the bill the\nfollowing month, and no late fees were assessed.17\nSubparagraph 1.b alleges a $1,433 delinquent medical bill. Applicant researched it, and\ndiscovered another person was responsible for it. In June 2007, the creditor confirmed Applicant did\nnot owe it.18\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and\nthose that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self- control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n19\n5\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in\nthe conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n19\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government did not present any evidence that Applicant\u2019s $377, credit card bill, as alleged\nin subparagraph 1.c,  was actually delinquent before he paid it. It creates no security concern.\nThe remaining two delinquencies and the bounced checks trigger the application of Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\nApplicant successfully demonstrated that subparagraph 1.b was not his responsibility. Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, applies.\nPaying a debt through a garnishment order does not constitute a good-faith repayment effort\nwithin the meaning of FC MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s testimony that he remained in contact with his ex-\nwife after their separation, but did not know she had filed for child support until he received a notice\nof garnishment several years after their separation was not credible. Consequently, although he has\nbeen consistently making the required payments through the garnishment for six years, it remains a\nsecurity concern because of his failure to discuss it candidly at the hearing.\nThe 1994 bounced checks also remain a security concern. He ignored the 1995 court order,\nleft the state, and did not pay until he returned several years later. The positive security implication\ngenerated by the length of time that has elapsed since he paid them is outweighed by the lack of\ntrustworthiness demonstrated by taking more than seven years to satisfy them, in contravention of a\ncourt order. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nCriminal Conduct\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s 1993 non-judicial punishment received while in the Army, and his 1994 arrest for\nwriting checks with insufficient funds generates security concerns under Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and CC\nDC 31(c): allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. Thirteen years have elapsed since the\ncommission of these crimes. Although Applicant\u2019s failure to pay restitution on time generates\nlingering financial considerations security concerns, the criminal conduct implication of this behavior\nis outweighed by the passage of time, the isolated nature of the criminal activities, and the\nrehabilitation demonstrated through his exemplary job performance since that time. Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and CC MC 32(d): there\nis evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement, apply. Applicant has mitigated the\ncriminal conduct security concern.\nWhole-Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide court-ordered assistance to his children for five years raises a\nsignificant security concern. This concern was heightened by his failure to testify credibly about it at\nthe hearing. Moreover, paying restitution for the 1994 bounced checks seven years after being court-\nordered to do so, was a flagrant violation of the court order. He ultimately satisfied them, and has\nbeen making payments toward the satisfaction of the child support delinquency for the past six years.\nThese positive factors do not outweigh the negative security implications generated by his repeated\nviolation of court orders and his lack of credibility displayed at the hearing.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 22,\n2003.  On January 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2007, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nMay 20, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted 14 items in support of its contention.\n2\n2\nthe Government\u2019s written case on February 20, 2008.  Applicant received a complete\n2\nfile of relevant material (FORM) on February 27, 2008, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional information on March 13, 2008, and\nApril 28, 2008. The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.e of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.d of\nthe SOR with explanations but denied any intentional falsification. Applicant denied the\nother allegations because the debts were paid or he had no knowledge of them. He\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1979, and received an Associate Degree in May 1982. He is divorced\nwith one child. He has worked for his current employer since October 2007 (GE 12).\nApplicant held an interim security clearance since 2003 (GE 3).\nFrom 1990 until 2003, Applicant worked in various positions in the field of\nelectronics (GE 12). He was unemployed for six months from May to September 2003\n(GE 5). In 2007, he also reported unemployment from May until October. \nIn October 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with a Driving Under the\nInfluence offense. He was speeding after leaving a bar. He was found guilty of DUI\n(Interview 2006). \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts, including one foreclosure on Applicant\u2019s\nhome in the amount of $76,986. The total amount of other debt that Applicant owes is\napproximately $20,000 (GE, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13).\nApplicant admitted that the account in allegation \u00b6 1.e for $76,986 is a result of\nunemployment and an inability to sell or make payments on the home that he\npurchased in 1997. The loan was for $77,000. He reports that when he purchased the\nhome he had good credit and no unpaid accounts. He could not make payments in\n2001 and the home was foreclosed in 2003 (GE 6). He believes the home was sold and\nbelieves he does not owe anything on the account due to FHA insurance. He has not\ncontacted anyone about this matter. The foreclosure is listed on a 2007 credit report\n(GE 13). \nFor the following allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, Applicant claimed that he\npaid the accounts. He provided documentation for 1.b, an account that was settled for\n\nApplicant submitted various bank statements and documents but did not identify which documents supported\n3\nthe debts listed in the allegations under Guideline F.\n3\n$890 (GE 9). Applicant submitted handwritten notes that were not legible (GE 3) and\nbank statements from his father for proof of payment for the other accounts. However,\nthey did not match the accounts in the SOR. In addition, 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are still\nlisted on the December 2007 credit bureau report (GE 13).3\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: one debt is paid.\nHe hired an attorney in March 2008 to work with the credit bureaus to audit and verify\nthe status of his credit report. He submitted a letter from the law firm, dated April 24,\n2008 stating that \u201caccording to our client\u2019s report\u201d certain accounts are no longer\nshowing on the credit report. Credit bureau reports dated February, March and April\n2007 show the accounts as noted above in 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d as unpaid in collection.\nApplicant did not report receiving financial counseling.\nApplicant\u2019s answer and submissions to the FORM explain his attempts to remove\nthe delinquent debts from his credit reports because he either disputed them or claimed\nthat the debt was paid. He did not provide sufficient documentation to support his\nposition concerning the debts alleged.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $2,500. He reported no monthly\nexpenses except for a miscellaneous $500 a month. His net remainder is listed as\n$1,950 (GE 9).\nApplicant completed his October 18, 2003 security application (executed on\nOctober 22, 2003). In that application he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24. Your Police\nRecord - Alcohol/Drug Offenses, and \u201cno\u201d to questions 35, 38 and 39 concerning\nfinancial matters (GE 4).4\nIn 2007, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he made an error\nand that he just incorrectly marked the boxes. He elaborated in his answer to the SOR\nthat he must not have read the question properly and he was not trying to hide anything\n(GE 3). \nIn March 2006, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance\nprocess. He reported to the investigator that his financial difficulties started in 2001. He\nrelated to the interviewer that he was unemployed in 2001 but that time period does not\ncorrespond with the dates listed in his security application for his period of\nunemployment. He also stated that he received unemployment benefits and worked\nsome odd jobs. He told the investigator that he knew his credit was \u201cless than favorable\u201d\nbut had not reviewed his credit reports in a few years. During the interview, Applicant\nacknowledged certain debts and also discussed his financial difficulties and the various\n\nThere is no reference in the record to a 1981 DW I as noted in 2.a of the SOR.\n5\n4\ndebts he had incurred. His credit reports confirm that Applicant had delinquent debts  in\n2003.\nWhen Applicant completed his October 2007 security clearance application he\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to section 23: Your Police Record (which asks about prior arrests). He\nreported a February 1990 felony for driving under the influence.  He also answered\n5\n\u201cyes\u201d to section 28 (a) and (b): Your Financial Delinquencies. He listed 2000 as the year\nthe delinquencies were incurred. He provided a credit card debt of $14,000 (not listed\non the SOR) and stated he is working with his creditors to verify the item (GE 12).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\na foreclosure on his home. He did not meet his financial obligations from 2001 until the\npresent time. His credit reports confirm that he has recent debts as well. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 2001. He accumulated some delinquent debt\ndue to an inability to pay his home mortgage. While those circumstances may have\nprecipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. He has not acted\nresponsibly. His conduct over the last six months with his creditors does not remove\nsecurity concerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good\n\n6\njudgment. He has approximately $20,000 in delinquent debt. This potentially mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported a period of unemployment in his answer to the FORM and in his\ninterview with the investigators in 2006. However, the information is not consistent with\nhis security clearance application employment periods. Although Applicant\u2019s home\nforeclosure may have initially started a downturn for him, he did not provide any\nexplanation as to how this impacted his ability to pay other debts. He also related that\nhe took odd jobs and received unemployment benefits. After he became re-employed,\nhe did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. He settled one debt in\n2006. While some overdue debts may have been made current after 2003, Applicant did\nnot provide documentation that the debts alleged have been paid. His reliance on his\nefforts to have items removed from his credit reports is not resolution of the financial\nissue. His efforts are not sufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant originally stated that he\ndisputed some debts. He did not elaborate and his responses and efforts focus on hiring\na law firm to remove the delinquent accounts from his credit reports rather than paying\nthem or providing documentation that they are not his bills. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\n\n7\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2003 security application, he did not\nlist any delinquent debts, or his 1990 arrest for driving while under the influence. In his\n2007 security application, he listed delinquent accounts and answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nquestions dealing with financial difficulties. In 2006, he reported during his security\ninvestigation that he knew he had credit problems. He also reported the 1990 DUI on\nhis 2007 application. In his answer to the FORM in 2008, Applicant stated that he made\nan error in not listing the relevant information concerning debts or his police record. His\nexplanations are not credible and not consistent. He provided deliberately false\ninformation. Thus, 16(a) applies.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns in this case. After considering them, none of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\n17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SF 86 in October 2003 is not minor. He did not\npromptly inform the government of his falsification. His interview in 2006 was three\nyears after his 2003 application. He did not receive counseling to improve his conduct.\nNo one advised him to falsify his SF 86. The falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated.\nThe falsification of his 2003 SF 86 casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment. Thus, none of the mitigating conditions apply under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has served in various positions with an\ninterim security clearance for a number of years. However, Applicant has a long history\n\n8\nof financial difficulties and has not resolved many debts. The record contains scant\ninformation concerning Applicant. He chose to have his case decided on the written\nrecord. His answer to the SOR and submissions to the FORM are not sufficient for him\nto meet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF-86) on January 30, \n2002. On February 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines D \n(sexual behavior), E (personal conduct), and J (criminal conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 20, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received his response on February 23, \nSeptember 23, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 18, 2009, and I received \nthe case assignment on May 21, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, \n2009, scheduling the hearing for June 10, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits, but did testify on his own \nbehalf. I held the record open until June 26, 2009, to afford the Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional evidence. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, \nwhich were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 with explanations. He did \nnot respond to SOR \u00b6 3. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 3 is cross-alleged with SOR \u00b6 1 and \nreiterates the same conduct under two different security concerns. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant testified at his hearing, and I found his testimony to be credible. \nMoreover, I found him to be open and forthright throughout the entire process. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior safety engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since June 1997. Tr.14, 16, GE 1. He has successfully held a secret \nlevel security clearance since 2002. Tr. 16.  \n \nApplicant completed his undergraduate studies in May 1988, and was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. He attended a provisionally \naccredited law school part-time for the last four years and completed his course work for \na Juris Doctorate in May 2009. As of the hearing date, Applicant\u2019s law school had not \nissued grades for the final semester that ended in May 2009. Tr. 13-15. Applicant has \nnever married and has an adopted 21-year-old son. Tr. 15-16, GE 1. \n \nThis case centers on two separate incidents, the first alleged as a concern under \nGuideline D (sexual behavior), and the second alleged as a concern under Guideline E \n(personal conduct). The third allegation under Guideline J (criminal conduct) is cross-\nalleged as the same incident under Guideline D. \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n \nThe conduct alleged under this concern states that Applicant was arrested in \nJune 2000 and charged with three class two felony counts of child molestation. The \nallegation further states that Applicant was acquitted by a jury of all charges in \nNovember 2000. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.)  \n \n\n \n \n3\n                                                          \n \nIn May 1996, Applicant began working at a church-operated homeless outreach \ncenter. Applicant was a member of a small staff. He worked in the kitchen and \nperformed minor maintenance or \u201cwhatever needed to be done.\u201d Tr. 20, GE 1. The \noutreach center served an economically disadvantaged community and provided a \nrange of social services. The outreach center primarily served an adult population; \nhowever, a small percentage of the adults brought children to the center. Tr. 21-23.  \n \nIt was at the outreach center that Applicant met his adopted son (AS), who was \neight years old at the time. AS\u2019s mother was unable to care for AS. Applicant provided \nAS with a home during the week and ensured he received proper medical care and \nwent to school. AS\u2019s mother had a drug problem and was absent for significant periods \nof time. Applicant\u2019s involvement with and responsibility for caring for AS increased over \ntime and ultimately led to Applicant adopting AS, discussed infra. Tr. 24-25. Applicant \ncontinued to work at the outreach center until he began his present job in June 1997. \nGE 1, GE 3. \n \n \nWhile at the outreach center, AS became friends with three other boys from \nsimilar backgrounds in his age group. AS asked Applicant if these three boys could \nspend time with AS at Applicant\u2019s house. In October 1998 following a sleepover, the \nthree boys accused Applicant of child molestation. The police and Child Protective \nService (CPS) immediately investigated the allegations.1 Applicant adamantly denied \nthe charges and opined that the boys were retaliating against him for scolding them for \nbreaking wooden shutters in his house. Tr. 9, 27-31, GE 2, GE 3, GE 5. In October \n1998, Applicant received a letter from CPS advising him that \u201c[t]he allegations of child \nabuse/neglect were invalid.\u201d AE A.  \n \n \nThe police and district attorney\u2019s office subsequently presented the allegation of \nchild molestation to the grand jury in August 1999, and the grand jury issued an \nindictment, charging Applicant with three charges of child molestation. GE 4. Neither the \npolice nor district attorney attempted to serve the arrest warrant on Applicant. In June \n2000, Applicant received a call from the adoption agency advising him that he had an \noutstanding warrant against him. At this point, Applicant had been pursuing adoption \nproceedings for AS for two-and-one-half years. The adoption agency case worker \ndiscovered the pending arrest warrant against Applicant during a routine background \ncheck. Applicant immediately contacted his adoption attorney, who contacted the police \ndepartment and notified the police that Applicant would self-surrender. Applicant was \nsubsequently arrested, placed in jail, and released. Tr. 32-36, GE 2, GE 3, GE 6. In \nNovember 2000, his case went to trial and Applicant was acquitted by a jury of all \ncharges against him.  \n \n \nThe adoption agency completed its background investigation of Applicant as a \nprospective parent and favorably endorsed his petition. On December 30, 2004, the \njuvenile division of the superior court found Applicant to be \u201ca fit and proper person to \n \n1 The government provided a copy of the arrest report/investigation, which contained the sordid \ndetails of the allegations the three boys made against the Applicant. GE 7. \n \n\n \n \n4\nadopt the minor child (AS); and the adoption would be in the child\u2019s best interest and \nwelfare\u201d and granted Applicant\u2019s petition to adopt AS. AE B. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe conduct alleged under this concern states that in April 2005, approximately \n30 photographs of nude, or partially clothed, juvenile males (ages 14-16) were \ndiscovered on Applicant\u2019s workplace computer. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \n \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant was summoned to his human resources office. Present \nwere several company officials, including his supervisor, facility security officer, and \nhuman resources director. They showed Applicant the pictures as described supra, and \nasked him how those pictures got on his work computer. The company officials also \nreminded Applicant the photos violated company internet policy. At the time he was \nquestioned by company officials, Applicant did not know how the pictures got there.  \n \nHe later surmised that the pictures, which were on his home computer, were \ntransferred to his pocket pc while docking to download files as a back-up. He was \nunaware that his pocket pc also downloaded the \u201cMy Pictures\u201d folder from his home \ncomputer and transferred stored photos from his pocket pc to his work computer while \ndocking. Applicant was not aware the photos were on his work computer and did not \nview them while at work. Tr. 41-51, GE 3.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the pictures were his and fully cooperated with company \nofficials during their investigation. The company officials advised Applicant he could \nkeep his job as long as he sought outside counseling. Applicant was later informed that \nthe local police department reviewed the photos and did not find anything illegal about \nthem. Tr. 41-43. GE 3.  \n \n \nApplicant contacted his Employee Assistance Program and was referred to a \ncounselor. Tr. 43. He eventually saw three different counselors. He acknowledged his \nhaving the photos on his computer was \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and he was \u201cdeeply \nsorry,\u201d adding that he would never have intentionally placed the photos on his work \ncomputer. Tr. 46, 53, 61, 72. \n \nApplicant stated: \n \nAt this point my life is an open book. The trial on charges of child \nmolestation is a public record, and the incidents with the pictures of naked \nboys have been disclosed. I am content with who I am at this point, and \nthere is nothing in my life that can be used to coerce or blackmail me. GE \n3. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from his counselor, a psychiatric social worker, dated \nJune 22, 2009. His counselor provided a positive report and stated Applicant is a \u201cwell \nrounded individual with a positive outlook on life and appropriate goals for the future of \nhimself and his son.\u201d AE C. \n\n \n \n5\nCriminal Conduct \n \nThe conduct alleged under this concern cross-alleges the conduct involved in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 3.a.) The facts outlined under the subheading Sexual Behavior \nsupra are incorporated under this section. \n \nCharacter References \n \nApplicant submitted two work-related references. His facility security officer \nsubmitted an e-mail stating, \u201cI am not aware of any activity by [Applicant] since March \n2006 (date he was hired at Applicant\u2019s company), which would preclude him from \nmaintaining his security clearance.\u201d AE D. His human resources director submitted an \ne-mail stating, \u201cI have no knowledge or record that [Applicant] has engaged in any \ninappropriate activity since an incident in 2005, (referring to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.) . . . which prompted an inquiry into his background. I am not aware of any present \nactivity that would prevent [Applicant] from maintaining his security clearance.\u201d AE E. \nApplicant stated that his company continues to support him. Tr. 9. \n \nApplicant provides ongoing support for his son. AS is completing his GED, and \nplans to continue his studies at community college. AS has a girlfriend of three years, is \n\u201cvery much into music,\u201d and wants to do something with his band. AS\u2019s mother works \nfor a traveling carnival and AS speaks to her several times a week. Applicant has \nsupported AS in locating his biological father and step-siblings. Tr. 78-79. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n \n6\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nConclusions \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n\n \n \n7\n \nThe Guideline delineates four disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nWhether or not a disqualifying condition is applicable under this concern depends \non the validity of the allegations. More often than not, allegations of this nature have \nbeen adjudicated in a reliable venue and determined to be valid. In this case, the \nallegations of child molestation were thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. In \nOctober 1988, three boys from an outreach center made allegations that Applicant \nmolested them during a sleepover that his adopted son had arranged. The police and \nCPS thoroughly investigated the allegations. In October 1988, CPS concluded the \nallegations of child abuse/neglect against Applicant were invalid.  \n \nIn August 1999, the district attorney referred the matter to the grand jury and the \ngrand jury issued an indictment of three felony counts of child molestation against \nApplicant. Nothing further happened until June 2000. In June 2000, Applicant received a \ncall from a social worker from the adoption agency advising him there was an \noutstanding arrest warrant against him. Applicant immediately contacted the attorney \nhandling his adoption for AS, who in turn contacted the police to arrange for a self \nsurrender. Applicant was subsequently arrested and released. In November 2000, \nApplicant went to trial by jury on the three felony counts of child molestation and was \nacquitted of all charges.  \n \nThe adoption agency subsequently completed its background check of Applicant \nand in December 2004, Applicant\u2019s petition to adopt AS was granted. The court \nspecifically found Applicant to be \u201ca fit and proper person to adopt the minor child (AS).\u201d \nApplicant adamantly and consistently denied the allegations against him. \n \nTo find against Applicant under this concern, I would have to substitute my \njudgment over CPS, the adoption agency, a jury of his peers, and, to a lesser extent, \nthe superior court judge who found Applicant to be a fit parent and granted his request \nto adopt AS. CPS, the adoption agency, and the jury all had the opportunity to assess \nthe accusers\u2019 credibility. Unexplained are the significant delays from offense to \nindictment and arrest warrant to arrest. The pending felony arrest warrant was \napparently discovered during Applicant\u2019s background check in conjunction with his \npetition to adopt AS. Having evaluated all of the available facts under this concern, and \n\n \n \n8\nhaving had an opportunity to hear Applicant\u2019s testimony, I do not find there to be a basis \nin fact to support the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n \nHaving concluded there is no basis in fact to support the allegations under this \nconcern, a discussion of mitigating conditions is not warranted. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe government established its case under Guideline E through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented that photos of nude, or partially clothed, juvenile \nmales (ages 14-16) were discovered on his workplace computer in April 2005. \n \nOf the seven personal conduct disqualifying conditions listed under \u00b6 AG 15, two \nare potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \n\n \n \n9\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct violated company internet policy and the content of the \nphotos had the potential to serve as a basis for exploitation or to cause him to be \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3), and 16(e) are \napplicable. \n \nOf the seven personal conduct mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17, \nthree are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s possession of the photos on his work computer was \nunintentional, he accepted responsibility for the photos being there and acknowledged \nthat his behavior was inappropriate. At the time company officials confronted Applicant \nin April 2005, they advised him that they would be retain him as an employee if the \nphotos were not illegal and he sought counseling. The police did not find the photos to \nbe illegal and Applicant sought counseling. His counselor provided a favorable \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s current well being. Four years have elapsed since the \nincident in question with no further recurrences. Applicant\u2019s company officials are fully \naware of the photo incident. Personal conduct mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), \nand 17(e) are applicable. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for criminal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n\n \n \n10\n                                                          \n \nThe government cross-alleged the conduct involved in \u00b6 1.a. under this concern. \nThe analysis and comments contained in the subheading Sexual Behavior, supra, are \nincorporated under this subheading. \n  \nOf the six criminal conduct disqualifying conditions listed under AG \u00b6 31, two are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was charged with three felony counts of child molestation. He went to \ntrial on these charges in November 2000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) are applicable. \nOf the five criminal conduct mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32, one is \napplicable:  \n \n(d) evidence that the person did not commit the offense. \n \nApplicant was acquitted at a jury trial of all charges in November 2000. The \nanalysis and comments contained in the subheading Sexual Behavior, supra, are \nincorporated under this subheading. AG \u00b6 32(d) is applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d2 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) that are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  \n \n \nI have carefully considered seriousness of the overall conduct alleged. The \ncomments contained under subheadings Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, and \nCriminal Conduct are incorporated under this section. As such, further discussion of the \nsexual behavior and criminal conduct concerns are not warranted. However, further \ndiscussion of personal conduct is appropriate. Weighing against Applicant is the \nconduct alleged under Personal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s acquisition of the photos in \nquestion was problematic on several levels. It had the potential of exposing him to \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                          \ncriminal liability and almost cost him his job. Also, the nature of the photos and their \nbeing on his workplace computer could have placed him in a compromising position.  \n \nThere is mitigating evidence that weighs in favor or granting Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. He promptly acknowledged that the photos were his and he fully cooperated \nwith his employer to include seeking counseling. Applicant has worked for his defense \ncontractor for 12 years and has successfully held a security clearance for seven years. \nApplicant adopted a disadvantaged youth and provided him with a positive environment. \nHe is a home owner, has stable employment, and is a contributing member of society. \nApplicant\u2019s human resources director and facility security officer did not disclose any \nadverse information precluding Applicant from being granted a security clearance. The \nevidence contains no derogatory record evidence about the Applicant. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence, years of loyal and honorable service working for a \ndefense contractor, his candor and cooperation throughout the security clearance \nprocess, and his potential for future service. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and \nall the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns pertaining to sexual behavior, personal conduct, \nand criminal conduct.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                  Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                  Paragraph 3, Guideline J: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 39 years old, married, and has four children.  He works for a defense contractor\nas a metal fabricator.  He has $50,633 in delinquent debt from tax liens and medical debts.  He\nresolved some of the tax liens, but none of the medical debts by his own initiative.  He failed to\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On April 16, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on May 24, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 23, 2007.  On September 20, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 3, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by deleting subparagraphs 1.c to 1.h, and then\nsubstituting new wording for each of those subparagraphs pertaining to tax lien liabilities.  The\namendment also added subparagraphs 1.tt to 1.ww.  Applicant had no objection to the amendment,\nand I granted the motion.  Applicant then stated his answers to each of the amendments on the\nrecord.  The Government also moved during the hearing to withdraw subparagraph 1.ff because this\ndebt was paid.  Applicant had no objection to the motion, and I granted the motion. (Tr. 7-10, 46)\nApplicant submitted additional exhibits after the close of the hearing.  The Government had\nno objection to these exhibits.  I marked them as Exhibits E to I and admitted them into evidence.\n(Tr. 68, 69)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations regarding his medical services delinquent\ndebts are incorporated here as findings of fact.  Applicant denied the allegations concerning tax liens.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 39 years old, married, and has four children.  One child has cerebral palsy.\nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a metal fabricator, and has been at that location for the\npast nine years.  He has a high school degree with no further education.  He does not have health\ninsurance through his employer because he claims it will cost him about $1,400 a month.  Instead,\nhe and his wife do not have health insurance for themselves, and use a state program to provide\ninsurance for their four children.  Applicant earns about $3,000 after taxes monthly, and his monthly\nexpenses nearly equal that amount of income.  He had two cars repossessed in the 1990s, and his\n\n3\ncurrent automobiles have no debt on them. His wife does not work outside the home. (Tr. 27-29, 53,\n57-63, 66; Exhibits 1-5)\nApplicant has 48 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  They total $50,633.  SOR subparagraph\n1.ss alleges Applicant did not file his 2003 and 2004 federal and state income tax returns.  That\nallegation is the 49  allegation in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts fall into two main\nth\ncategories, state tax liens and medical bills which are unpaid.  Applicant\u2019s repayment plan for any\nor all of these debts is to allow a judgment be entered against him in court, then have the\ngarnishment process take the money from his paycheck.  He claims he paid $14,000 in debts over\nthe past three years using this method.  Applicant\u2019s attitude is if he does not have the money in his\npaycheck, he will not miss it or spend it.  He also claims he does not have money available in his\npaycheck to repay these delinquent debts each month. Applicant has household repair expenses to\nreplace windows and a furnace in his 100-year-old house this winter.  Applicant is not certain which\ndebts have been paid and which remain unpaid.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the 1990s to\neliminate medical debts arising from his first child\u2019s birth when his employer\u2019s insurance plan did\nnot pay for those expenses. (Tr. 41-46, 49, 63-65)\nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies arose from two types of taxes.  The first is his local city income\ntax.  His employer does not withhold money for that tax, so Applicant has to pay it directly to the\ncity government.  He has not done so, and the city filed tax liens against him.  He has now paid those\ndebts, and plans on paying a portion of the tax debt every six months.  The second type of tax lien\nApplicant incurred was for a business he tried to start and operate.  It did not operate, and he had no\nliability for taxes, but he did not clear his tax record with his state taxing agency.  Now he has\nresolved those liens and convinced the state to withdraw them.  Applicant paid the city tax by\ngarnishment as listed in Subparagraph 1.a.  Examining the exhibits, and comparing the amounts in\nthe SOR alleged to the releases offered by Applicant, the tax liens in Subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g,\n1.j, 1.tt, and 1.uu were business taxes mistakenly assessed against him.  The judgements and liens\nwere released by the state government. (Tr. 24-37, 52, 53; Exhibits 2-5, A-E)\nApplicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts listed in the SOR are unpaid medical bills, except\nfor a $482 medical debt in Subparagraph 1.ff which the Government withdrew, an unpaid credit card\ndebt for $722 in Subparagraph 1.pp, an unpaid telephone bill for $141 in Subparagraph 1.qq, and a\ndeficiency on a repossessed vehicle from the 1990s for $1,470 in Subparagraph 1.rr.  Applicant has\nno repayment plan in effect or contemplated to repay any of these debts. (Tr. 33-53; Exhibits 2-5,\nF-I)\nApplicant filed his 2003 and 2004 tax returns, with amendments because he and his wife\nwere separated for a while in those tax years, and the filing status needed to be adjusted in April\n2006.  Applicant set aside his tax forms for those years, and when they were out of sight, they were\nout of his mind, having been overwhelmed by his financial problems, as he claims. (Tr. 55, 56)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\n\n4\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n\n5\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions each of the\nallegations in the SOR.\nFinancial Considerations: Applicant has $50,633 of alleged delinquent debts.  He has no\nrepayment plan in effect nor does he contemplate implementing a plan.  He has not taken the\ninitiative to repay his debts, probably because he does not have the income to repay the debts.  He\nhas done nothing to repay his medical bills, despite having a state medical plan based on the number\nof his children and his income, he incurred thousands of dollars of medical bills which he cannot\nrepay on his income.\nThe disqualifying conditions (DC) applicable are \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts), and \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  Applicant prefers to allow himself\nto be sued and to have his wages garnished to repay his delinquent debts.  He is unable to repay his\ndebts on his own initiative based on his limited income.  His history of not paying his medical debts\ndates from the 1990s.  \nThe Mitigating Condition (MC) which might be applicable is \u00b620.b (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, and the\nperson acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant\u2019s educational limitations, and his job\nclassification, coupled with having four children to raise on a limited income, complicates his ability\nto repay his debts.  Apparently, his wife cannot work because she cares for their child who has\ncerebral palsy.  To an extent his situation is beyond his control due to these facts.  However, this MC\ndoes not overcome the DC because he did not show any efforts to resolve his medical expenses, or\nrepay on his own initiative the 31 medical debts which are under $500 individually.  He has been\n\n6\nemployed for the past nine years, and he did not show any business downturn adversely affected him.\nTherefore, this MC has limited application.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nI considered all nine factors in relationship to Applicant and his situation.  Applicant was a\nparent and an adult when all these debt liabilities were incurred.  They occur frequently and are likely\nto be repeated based on the debt history presented.  He has not made a good-faith or timely effort to\nrepay his debts.  The use of garnishment proceedings is not a good-faith effort on the part of\nApplicant to voluntarily repay his delinquent debts.  In summary, none of the \u201cwhole person\nconcept\u201d factors are applicable to result in a favorable resolution for Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s struggles on a low income and with family health care issues were factors I\nevaluated.  Applicant should have attempted to establish a debt reduction plan and a family budget\nwith the assistance of a reputable debt counselor through his bank or credit union, or a community\norganization.  Also, Applicant should have been pro-active in his efforts to resolve his financial\nobligations.  Applicant should examine his health care debt history, and seek ways to repay the past\ndebts, and minimize incurring additional debt through the use of state programs, a primary care\nphysician instead of the hospital emergency room for ordinary illnesses, and similar procedures the\nstate or community programs may provide him and his family. \nTherefore, based on all the evidence and the guidelines, I conclude the financial\nconsiderations security concern against Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d\nagainst Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

WHITE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nGov X 3 (Applicant\u2019s letter response to SOR dated Dec. 14, 2006).\n1\nThe government submitted four items in support of the allegations, and seven source documents in support of\n2\na request to take administrative notice of material facts concerning Israel.\n2\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He holds dual U.S. and Israeli\ncitizenship, as do his fianc\u00e9 and all members of both of their immediate families. His sister, and his\nfiance\u2019s father and sisters reside in Israel. During his four visits to Israel in the eight years since he\nturned 18 years old, Applicant traveled using the active Israeli passport which he intends to maintain.\nApplicant submitted no mitigating evidence for consideration, and did not meet his burden to\novercome foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on March 13, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor. On December 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated December 14, 2006,\nadmitting the truth of all of the allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing.  Applicant did not submit any matters for consideration in extenuation or\n1\nmitigation of his admissions. Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on\nJanuary 31, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to\n2\nApplicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the\nFORM on February 12, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. He did not submit any further response to\nthe FORM by the March 12, 2007 due date, nor did he request an extension of time to respond. The\ncase was assigned to me on March 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of every factual allegation set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nforeign preference under Guideline C (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c), and foreign influence under\nGuideline B (subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c). Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\n\nGov X 4 (e-QIP security clearance questionnaire, dated Mar.13, 2006) at 6, 15, 31-32. (Note: Gov X 4 contains\n3\npages 6 of 34 through 34 of 34 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP, but does not include pages 1to 5 of 34. Citations are to the numbers\non each page, starting with 6.) \nId. at 1, 7, 8, 13-14.\n4\nId. at 20-25.\n5\nId. at 9, 24.\n6\nId. at 25-26.\n7\nId. at 26.\n8\nAlthough Department Counsel lists eight source documents on pages 4 and 5 of the FORM, document II, the\n9\nConsular Information Sheet dated February 8, 2006, was not actually provided in the file.  Department Counsel only\nattempted to cite this document once (at FORM footnote 1), from what I can tell. The subsequent \u201cId.\u201d citations appear\nto refer to document I (the first source cited in footnote 1), since the information matches. Accordingly, the omission of\nsource document II does not affect the validity of taking administrative notice of the facts supported by the other seven\nsource documents. The FORM also incorrectly cites the date of source document IV as \u201cJanuary 17, 2006,\u201d when the\ncorrect date is \u201cJanuary 17, 2007.\u201d\n3\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security\nclearance for the first time.  He was born and educated, through graduate school, in the United\n3\nStates, and is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  Applicant reported on his security\n4\nquestionnaire, and admitted in response to the SOR, that his father, his mother, and his fianc\u00e9 are\ndual citizens of Israel and the U.S., currently residing in the U.S. He further reported and admitted\nthat his sister, and his fiance\u2019s father and sisters are dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel who currently\nreside in Israel.  His father was born in Israel and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985. His\nsister was born in Israel and was registered as a U.S. citizen born abroad, based on their mother\u2019s\nU.S. citizenship.  Both his mother and his fianc\u00e9 were born in the U.S.   Applicant and his fianc\u00e9 live\n5\nin an apartment together.6\nApplicant possesses a valid Israeli passport, and stated he has no specific plans regarding it.7\nHe used this Israeli passport instead of his U.S. passport during trips to Israel from July to August\n1999, July to August 2002, June to July 2004, and December 2005 to January 2006.  He was over\n8\nage 18 during each of these trips. Applicant neither asserted that any mitigating conditions applied\nto his circumstances, nor provided any evidence on which such a finding could be made.\nDepartment Counsel sought administrative notice of the material facts concerning Israel set\nforth in part III of the FORM, and provided seven official U.S. Government source documents\nsupporting the truth of those facts.  I did take administrative notice of those facts in reaching my\n9\ndecision in this case. Among the most pertinent of these facts are that Israel is a close ally of the\nUnited States, and is a parliamentary democracy with close historic and cultural ties and many\nmutual interests. Israel has, however, been identified as an active collector of sensitive and\nproprietary industrial information, and several individuals have been recently convicted of\nconducting espionage through unauthorized disclosure or sale of classified information to Israel.\nAnti-western terrorist activity in Israel is a continuing threat to Americans, and others. \nPOLICIES            \n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\n10\nInformation, dated August 2006 \u00b6 2.\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n11\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n12\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n4\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual's eligibility for access to classified information.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n10\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n11\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n12\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 9.\n16\n5\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n13\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n14\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n15\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\" Nothing in this decision should be\nconstrued to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndecision as to Applicant's loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)          \n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Appellant admitted the truth of three SOR allegations\n16\nthat raise security concerns under this guideline.\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege\nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship\nof a family member [including but not limited to] possession of a current foreign passport\u201d), and FP\nDC 10(b) (\u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d)\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 6.\n17\n6\napply to Applicant\u2019s ongoing possession, and consistent use during overseas travels, of an active\nIsraeli passport. He was born in the United States, yet acquired Israeli citizenship through his dual\ncitizen parents, and maintains dual citizenship as an adult. During each of his four visits to Israel\nsince turning age 18, he has used his Israeli passport to gain entry as a citizen, in lieu of identifying\nhimself as an American. The elections by his sister and his fiance\u2019s immediate family members to\nreside in Israel also demonstrates a strong affinity for that country by those to whom he is bound by\nclose ties of affection. \nI have considered each potentially applicable Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP\nMC), even though none was asserted by Applicant in his response to the SOR or FORM. FP MC\n11(a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d) does\nnot apply.  Applicant was born in the United States, and some process was required for him to obtain\nand actively maintain his Israeli passport and dual citizenship. There is no evidence from which to\npossibly conclude that FP MC 11(b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship\u201d) could apply to Applicant. He has expressed no such willingness, and his actions\nindicate an unwillingness to do so. \nFP MC 11(c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor\u201d) does not\napply. Applicant was born a U.S. citizen. His alleged and admitted exercise of Israeli citizenship\noccurred after he turned age 18, and continues to present \u2013 some eight years later. FP MC 10(d) (\u201cuse\nof a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority\u201d) does not apply because no\nsuch authority approved his use of the Israeli passport, nor (possibly excepting the most recent visit\nwhen he was working as an intern for his current employer but had not yet applied for a clearance)\ndid he hold any position in which he would have had a \u201ccognizant security authority\u201d during his\nvisits to Israel. Finally, Applicant provided no evidence to indicate that FP MC 10(e) (\u201cthe passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority or otherwise invalidated\u201d)\napplies. He, in fact, indicated that he has no particular plans for the passport which I interpret to\nmean he plans to keep it and use it again in the future.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)            \n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d17\nAll of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members, as well as his fianc\u00e9 and her father and sisters,\nare dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel. His sister and his fiance\u2019s family also reside in Israel.\nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9 live together in the United States. These circumstances raise security\nconcerns under foreign influence disqualifying condition (FI DC) 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or resident in\n\n7\na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d). Israel is active in the collection of protected information,\nincluding from U.S. citizens, and there is heightened risk of anti-Israeli and anti-American  terrorism\nby groups active within its borders. FI DC 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government\nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or\ncountry by providing this information\u201d) also potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s Israeli connections.\nThere need not be evidence of an actual conflict of interest to raise security concerns, the potential\nconflict, arising from Applicant\u2019s numerous and close ties to Israeli citizens and residents, is\nsufficient to shift the burden to him to disprove its existence or otherwise mitigate the concerns. In\naddition, Applicant lives with his fianc\u00e9, so security concerns are raised under FI DC 7(d) (\u201csharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates\na heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d), because his fiance\u2019s\nfather and sisters are dual citizens residing in Israel and subject to the same heightened risk arising\nunder FI DC 7(a). \nApplicant has neither asserted that any foreign influence mitigating condition (FI MC)\napplies to his circumstances, nor is there any evidence in the record that would support the\napplication of any FI MC.  I have reviewed each potential FI MC and conclude that none apply. \nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant, his entire known family and his fiance\u2019s entire known family are dual citizens of\nthe United States and Israel. Applicant\u2019s sister and father were born in Israel. Applicant, his mother\nand his fianc\u00e9 were all born in the United States and actively sought and maintain their Israeli\ncitizenship. During each of his four documented visits to Israel in the eight years since he turned age\n18, Applicant exercised his Israeli citizenship, and traveled using the active Israeli passport which\nhe apparently plans to maintain for future use. \nApplicant submitted neither evidence nor other information from which any mitigating\ncondition or circumstance might be applied to lessen the security concerns raised by the potential\nfor conflict of interest, coercion, pressure or manipulation created by his foreign connections and his\nindications of foreign preference. Applicant is a mature and educated individual who is accountable\nfor his choices, and who demonstrated no effort to alleviate security concerns in the face of his\nburden to do so. Given Israel\u2019s reportedly active collection of protected information and heightened\nrisk of anti-western terrorist activity within its borders, this burden is a heavy one and Applicant\nfailed to meet it. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant him access to classified information.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 50-year-old programmer employed by a federal contractor.  Applicant\u2019s brother\nis a citizen and resident of the Republic of South Korea (hereinafter \u201cKorea\u201d), her husband and two\nsons are citizens of Korea residing in the United States, and her mother, a brother, and two sisters\nare citizens of Korea living in the United States.  She traveled to Korea in 1999 when her father\nbecame ill with cancer, and again in 2000 for his funeral.  She did not submit mitigating evidence\nand did not allay the government\u2019s security concerns about foreign influence.  Clearance is denied.\n\nItem 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated December 5, 2006).\n1\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006)\n2\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service,\n802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).\nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative\n3\nnotice). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 5, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 5, 2006, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The\nPresident issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1,\n2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case\nproceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 18, 2006, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of\nthe government\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on September 7, 2007.  Applicant\nwas afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by October 7, 2007.  She filed no response.  The case was assigned to me on November\n2, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Government Exhibits I\nthrough X.  Applicant raised no objection.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.   The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice\n2\nfacts that are either well known or from government reports.   I took administrative notice of various\n3\nfacts derived from Government Exhibits I through X, as indicated under subheading \u201cSouth Korea\u201d\nof this decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nItem 1, supra, note 1, at 1-2.\n4\nId. at 3-6.\n5\nId. at 1.\n6\nId. at 8, 10.\n7\nAnswer to the SOR, dated December 18, 2006.\n8\nId. \n9\nItem I: U.S. State Department Background Note: South Korea - January 2007.\n10\nId. \n11\nItem IV: Congressional Research Service (CRS), Report for Congress: Korea: U.S. - Korean Relations - Issues for\n12\nCongress - 2005.\nItem V: CRS Report for Congress: The Rise of China and its Effect on Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea: U.S. Policy\n13\nChoices - 2006.\n3\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 50-year-old programmer employed by a federal contractor.   She is married\n4\nand has three children.   She has a college degree.   She has no military service, and this is her first\n5\n6\napplication for a security clearance.7\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the Republic of South Korea (hereinafter\n\u201cKorea\u201d.)  He plans to immigrate to the United States to join the rest of his family as soon as he is\nable.  Her husband and two sons are citizens of Korea residing in the United States.  Her oldest son\nis a citizen of the U.S.  One son is waiting for the final phase of citizenship, and the other son is in\nthe process of application for citizenship.  Her husband plans to apply for citizenship.  Her mother,\na brother, and two sisters are citizens of Korea living in the United States.  They plan to apply for\ncitizenship as soon as they have met the residency requirements.  She traveled to Korea in 1999\nwhen her father became ill with cancer, and again in 2000 for his funeral.8\nThe only evidence submitted by Applicant was her one-page answer to the SOR.9\nSouth Korea\nEven though South Korea (sometimes referred to as Korea) is a constitutional democracy\nwith a history of friendly relations with the United States, in recent years South Korea has moved\nto strengthen economic and political ties with North Korea.   South Korea is North Korea\u2019s second\n10\nlargest trading partner.   Since 1998, South Korean public opinion has been openly critical of the\n11\nU.S. and its policies toward North Korea.   Since 2004, South Korea has exported more goods to\n12\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) than to the U.S.   These strengthening ties between South\n13\n\nItem VI: Annual report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage - 2004.\n14\nItem X: Pleadings in United States v. Kim , No. CR-97-117-A (E.D. Va. Feb. 7, 2001).\n15\nGuideline \u00b6 2. \n16\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\n17\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n4\nKorea and North Korea and China increase the government\u2019s concern about applicant\u2019s who have\nfamily members who are citizens or residents of South Korea.\nSome countries seek unauthorized access to classified information in order to reap the\nbenefits of sensitive U.S. technology.  Individuals from both private and public sectors in nearly 100\ncountries attempted to illegally acquire U.S. technology in FY 2004 , and South Korea has in the\n14\npast used covert methods to acquire classified information by exploiting its relationship with\nAmerican citizens of Korean descent, as in the case of U.S. v. Kim.15\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.   An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n16\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\nvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.17\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201cany doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n18\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n19\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n20\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n21\n.  \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n22\n5\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n19\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n20\nGovernment.\n2\n1\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.22\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 6.  The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n23\nISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000).\n24\n6\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism.\nGuidelines \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group,\nor country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status,\nif that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\nThe government established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant\u2019s admitted contacts and\npotential vulnerability based on those contacts make applicable the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6 7 (a), (b), and (d).  Her close bonds to her immediate family, who are not citizens of\nthe U.S., create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as\na matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in a foreign\ncountry, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the\npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  The Appeal Board has held that family ties with citizens or residents of a foreign\n23\ncountry raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of\nrebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion--that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.   The\n24\nGovernment produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying conditions, and the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  As previously indicated,\nthe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nGuidelines \u00b6 8. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\n\n7\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country; and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests\nis such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively\nto influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR does not detail how and whether any of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  She did not provide evidence about her family\u2019s employment, social activities, and\ncontacts in order to make a case that it would be unlikely that she would be placed in situations that\nwould place her in a position of having to choose between foreign interests and the interests of the\nUnited States.  She offered no evidence about her relatives and their jobs, activities, or financial\ninterests, making it impossible to determine their susceptibility to pressure or coercion from the\nSouth Korean government or other foreign organizations or entities.  She provided no information\nabout her husband\u2019s interaction with his parents and relatives and whether or not there is a potential\nfor influence based on those contacts.  She has the burden to prove that her contacts with foreign\nnationals have no risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  Since she did not prove that these\ncontacts were casual and infrequent, I can only assume they are not.  No mitigating conditions apply.\nIn SOR subparagraph 1.d., the government alleged that Applicant traveled to Korea in 1999\n(when her father became ill with cancer) and again in 2000 (for his funeral).  No other foreign travel\nis alleged.  These trips are personal and are not determinative of her security suitability.  I find for\nApplicant on this allegation.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors which are used for\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Foreign influence and foreign preference do not involve misconduct,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth whole person\n25\nfactor apparently without discussion of the other factors was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar.\n8, 2006) (sole whole person factor mentioned is eighth factor in discussion of Judge\u2019s whole person analysis for Iranian-\nAmerican\u2019s case).  \nCompare ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 2 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006) (noting Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential\n26\nfor exploitation\u201d but affirming denial of clearance based on contacts with Iranian family members); with ISCR Case No.\n03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic\npotential for exploitation\u201d).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n27\n8\nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc.  Accordingly, the eighth\nadjudicative process factor is probably the most relevant.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.  The eighth factor\nprovides, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   Korea\u2019s government is not\n25\nhostile to the United States, but Applicant has not shown that there is no significant possibility of\npressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.  \nApplicant has not provided any other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life\nas a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting a clearance.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis in a\nGuideline B case should include \u201cthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including\nthe realistic potential for exploitation)\u201d as well as the eighth factor discussed in the previous\nparagraph.   In this case, Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation is unknown.  After weighing the\n26\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole\nperson, I conclude Applicant has failed to meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns\npertaining to foreign influence.  \nBased on the Appeal Board\u2019s Guideline B jurisprudence pertaining to cases involving\nKorean-Americans, who have frequent contacts with family members living in Korea, Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility and suitability cannot be approved.  I take this position based on the law, as set\nforth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole\nperson factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\n27\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly not consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He does not have the ability to pay off or otherwise resolve these debts.  He is not currently\neligible for security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 16, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 12, 2007.  Notices of Hearing\nwere issued on February 16 and March 1, 2007.  The case was reassigned to me on March 6, 2007.\nA hearing was held on March 29, 2007, at which the Government presented five documentary\nexhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted nine exhibits.  The transcript\nwas received on April 13, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 60, single and has a high school education.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a Security Officer, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with\nhis employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a.,\n1.b., and 1.c. of the Statement of Reasons.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant endured a long period of unemployment in 2003-2004.  The majority of his\npast-due debts were accrued during that time.  In addition, the Applicant stated that he had been\ntaken advantage of by a con artist during that time.  The Applicant was trying to make headway in\n\n3\na different field and was working with a person who manipulated the Applicant to continue to pay\nbills using his credit cards.  (Transcript at 57-58, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 7.)  He has been working\nfor his current employer since 2004.  However, he has not been able to repay the vast majority of his\npast-due debts since that time.\n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owes at least $8,820.00 on a delinquent credit card\naccount.  The Applicant has not made any payments on this account in several years.  He intends to\ncontact this creditor at some point in the future and make payment arrangements.  (Transcript at 41-\n44, Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owes at least $1,264.00 on a second delinquent credit card\naccount.  The Applicant has not made any payments on this account in several years.  He intends to\ncontact this creditor at some point in the future and make payment arrangements.  (Transcript at 45-\n46, Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)\n1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owes at least $5,881.00 on a third delinquent credit card\naccount.  The Applicant was making payments on this debt in 2003, but has not made any payments\non this account in several years.  He intends to contact this creditor at some point in the future and\nmake payment arrangements.  (Transcript at 48-49, Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)\nThe Applicant stated that, as of the date of the hearing, he had been setting aside money to\npay his taxes.  Once his taxes are paid, he can begin again saving money to resolve the indebtedness\nto the three creditors set forth above.  (Transcript at 47-48.)\n1.d.  The Applicant testified that he had no knowledge of this alleged $53.00 past due debt\nto a telephone company until receiving the SOR.  Once he received the SOR he paid this debt off.\n(Transcript at 49-51.)  He presented copies of his wireless telephone bill for July 2006 (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F) and his home telephone bill for November and December 2006 (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).\nNone of these bills shows this particular past due amount.  This subparagraph is found for the\nApplicant.\n1.e.  The Applicant denied that he currently has $1,480.00 in money available every month\nafter he pays his regular debts.  That figure was based on his making overtime on a consistent basis,\nsomething that as of the time of the hearing was not happening.  He stated that $400.00 to $500.00\na month in extra cash is a more likely figure over the past three years.  (Transcript at 51-54.)\nHowever, the Applicant could not answer questions about how he used his extra money,\napproximately $18,000.00 over the past three years, even using his own figures.  (Transcript at 67-\n68.)\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant testified that he is very knowledgeable about security practices.  He further\ntestified that he assisted the Federal Government on an important potential espionage case in the\n1990s.  (Transcript at 39-41, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\n\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s work supervisor submitted a letter on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.  He states that\nthe Applicant is \u201creliable, trustworthy, and an asset to both myself, and the client.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B.)\nThe Applicant presented evidence showing that he had successfully paid off a past due debt,\nnot alleged in the SOR, in 2006.  He accepted a payment arrangement offered by a credit card\ncompany and paid them $563.00 on a debt of approximately $2,500.00.  (Transcript at 62-63,\nGovernment Exhibit 5.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n5\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of financial irresponsibility that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has a history of being unable, or unwilling, to pay his debts in a timely fashion.  Such\nevidence shows unreliability, untrustworthiness and poor judgment on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him, except\nin part.  Under Paragraph 1 (Guideline F), as set forth above, subparagraph 1.d. is found for the\nApplicant.\nThe Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are of a long-standing nature.  Even though they may\nhave originally been caused by the Applicant being out of work and making a poor business choice,\nhe has presented insufficient evidence that he will be able to resolve his debts any time in the\nforeseeable future.  Rather, the Applicant asks the Government to trust him when he states that he\nwill pay his debts eventually.  \n\n6\nUnder Guideline F, the following Disqualifying Conditions are applicable: 19(a) \u201cInability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and 19(c) \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  None\nof the Mitigating Conditions apply.  The behavior is recent, he is not receiving counseling for the\nproblem and he has not initiated a good faith effort to repay the creditors or resolve the debts.  I have\nconsidered the fact that the Applicant did have a period of unemployment during which many of the\ndebts were incurred.  However, the evidence does not show that the Applicant acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances during that period.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's\ninformation opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H. Ross\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(See Government Exhibit 1). On May 9, 2008, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 5, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on July 9, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 9, 2008, and the matter\nwas scheduled for hearing on August 5, 2008.  The Government presented sixteen\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 16, which were received without\nobjection. The Applicant presented twenty-two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through V.  The Applicant also testified on her own behalf.  The record\nremained open until close of business on August 20, 2008 to allow the Applicant the\nopportunity to submit additional documentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing\n\n2\nExhibit that was admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on August 12, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 44 years old and has a high school diploma.  She is employed\nby a defense contractor as a Security Officer, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she engaged in criminal conduct.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline I - Psychological Conditions).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she has certain emotional mental, and\npersonality conditions that can impair her judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.\nOn October 8, 1997, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Threatening a\nFederal Official in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 115 and 1114, both felonies.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 2, 3, 5 and 14).  \nThe charges were based upon the following information: The Applicant is said to\nhave made numerous telephone calls and sent letters to a Congressman\u2019s office which\ncontained verbal assaults and threats to kill members of his staff.  The Applicant is said\nto have contacted the congressman\u2019s office in order to solicit assistance in obtaining\npassports for herself and her three children.  \nOn June 14, 1997, the Applicant wrote a letter to Congressman A\u2019s office in\nwhich she requested assistance in resolving a custody battle.  The letter was forwarded\nto Congressman\u2019s B\u2019s office who responded requesting additional information regarding\nthe custody matter, and also provided the Applicant with a point of contact.  During the\nmonths of July and August 1997, the Applicant made numerous telephone calls to\nCongressman\u2019s B\u2019s office in efforts to schedule an appointment.  \nOn August 12, 1997, the Applicant was advised that she would not be granted an\nappointment.  On August 13, 1997, the Applicant telephoned Congressman B\u2019s office\nand stated that because he had not solved her problems, she intended to go to his\nhome to obtain his help.  \nOn September 15, 1997, the Applicant arrived at Congressman B\u2019s office in\nWashington D.C.  She stated that she and the Congressman had met in San Diego and\nhad been long-time friends.  It was noted by the office staff member that the Applicant\nwas rambling and incoherent in her conversation and appeared to be delusional.  On\nthe recommendation of the staff member, who was the only one working in the\ncongressman\u2019s office at that time, and who was frightened and intimidated by the\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, the Applicant was to leave and return later that day.  When the\nApplicant returned to the office, she related details of a complex custody case and\nspoke of mental and physical abuse she and her three children have experienced by an\n\n3\nunknown individual.  The Applicant became belligerent as the conversation progressed\nand then demanded, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d.  The Congressman\u2019s staff members\nwho witnessed the conversation with the Applicant, described her as irrational and\ndelusional with deep rooted \u201cmental problems\u201d.  While in the Congressman\u2019s office she\nbecame increasingly aggravated and violent.  One staff member was prepared to\nforcibly remove the Applicant from the office when she turned and walked out.  \nOn September 28, 1997, a telephone voice mail message was received by\nCongressman B\u2019s office.  The caller identified herself stating, \u201cHi this is Lolita, I live at\nsix seven four Palm Avenue, Imperial Beach,...I\u2019d like to tell you something if you dare\nme, United States of the Government, I swear to God to put a bullet in your head.  Now\nwill you take me to court for threatening you\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 2 ).  \nOn September 29, 1997, a staff assistant from the Congressman\u2019s office in San\nDiego, received a telephone call from the Applicant.  The Applicant stated, \u201cI\u2019ll have my\nfather show you to your graves.\u201d  Two handwritten letters were received at\nCongressman\u2019s San Diego office during the months of June and July 1997.  The letters\nwere both signed by the Applicant.       \nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with violating 18 United States Code, Section 115, which is influencing,\nimpeding, or retaliating against a Federal Officer by threatening or injuring a family\nmember, and Section 1114, assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or\nemployees.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 5 and 14).  \nOn December 4, 1997, the court found that the Applicant was suffering from a\nmental defect, rendering her incompetent to understand the nature and consequences\nof the proceeding against her.  It was ordered that she undergo psychiatric treatment.\nThe Applicant was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for about 120 days\nof treatment.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant stated that she spent\napproximately two years in custody.\nOn March 13, 1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a report to the\npresiding judge stating that the Applicant was at that point competent to stand trial.  The\nreport indicates that the Applicant suffers from Bipolar Disorder, delusions, including a\nbelief in a government conspiracy against her and that she will need treatment for her\nillness in the foreseeable future.  The Applicant had not been compliant with treatment\nefforts.  (See Government Exhibit 2).\nThe Applicant was released from treatment and appeared in court in May 1998.\nThe court placed her in a deferred prosecution program where she was on probation for\nabout 18 months, with the condition that she remain medicine compliant and in\ntreatment and not contact the Congressman\u2019s office.  After completing the deferred\nprosecution program, the case against the Applicant was dismissed.  \nBased upon the Applicant\u2019s past psychological history, the Department of\nDefense requested that the Applicant undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  Although the\nApplicant went to her evaluations, she was uncooperative with the doctors.  A brief\npsychological report from a clinical psychologist who tried to evaluate the Applicant\n\n4\nindicates that the nature of her illness or condition was impossible to determine because\nshe was completely uncooperative.  (See Government Exhibits 8 and 9).  A letter from\nanother physician at a Psychiatric Center dated November 14, 2007, indicates that the\nApplicant was seen and evaluated on September 13, 2007, for a security clearance\nevaluation, but the Applicant denied any psychiatric history and no records were\navailable or provided to the physician at the time.  Upon review of the records, the\nphysician indicates that she can no longer recommend the Applicant for a security\nclearance.  She recommended that the Applicant receive an extensive evaluation or\npsychological testing to determine whether she is fit for work.  (See Government Exhibit\n11).  \nThe Applicant denies that she has ever had a mental illness of any sort.  (Tr.p.\n144).  A letter to DOHA from the Applicant in her own handwriting states in part, \u201c Keep\nin mind I don\u2019t want classified, secret, or Top Secret clearances at this time.  I explained\nI\u2019m not skilled and or trained enough or worth enough for those positions\u201d.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 13).\n       \nThe Applicant testified that the address from which the telephone calls were to\nhave come from was where she lived from time to time, but that there were other\nindividuals who lived at the residence who were convicted felons.  (Tr. p 50).  Applicant\nindicated that she had moved to Clovis with her three children.  Two weeks later, her\nchildren were taken from her.  She believes that her ex-boyfriend, whose brother or\nbrother-in-law is a police officer, had something to do with it.  One page of a police\nreport offered by the Applicant indicates that the Applicant and her boyfriend were\nhaving on- going relationship problems and were in a conflict over who was the father of\none of their children.  The Applicant\u2019s boyfriend was given temporary custody of the\nApplicant\u2019s children and the Applicant was ordered to move out of the apartment.  The\nApplicant indicates that she has not seen her children since 1997.  For assistance with\nthe matter, the Applicant admits that she contacted congressman B\u2019s office.  She denies\nany criminal behavior on her part.  She contends that she wrote only one letter to the\nCongressman and that she never called or went to the Congressman\u2019s San Diego\noffice.      \nThe Applicant submitted various types of documentary evidence in an attempt to\nshow that she has no mental defect, but is functional and talented.  Among other\ndocuments, she placed into evidence a copy of her business license for her cleaning\nservice.  Her business is called, \u201cBrain Dead\u201d, named after her cousin who died.  (Tr. p.\n31 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A); a truck driver\u2019s daily log book, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B),\narticles on a contemporary fan design by her cousin, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C), pictures of\nfamily members who have contributed to society in some way, including pictures of her\nthree children, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D), her social security card, commercial driver\u2019s\nlicense and Haz-Mat endorsement (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E), a letter from an elementary\nschool concerning her children (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G), a court summons related to the\nincident with her boyfriend, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H) and various other correspondence,\nincluding a letter from the registrar of voters with whom the Applicant volunteers\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I), birth certificates of her children (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L), one page\nof a police report when her children were removed from her home (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nM), a negative drug screening test (Applicant Exhibit S), her leave and earning report to\nshow that she pays taxes, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit T), and a letter from Congressman\u2019s B\n\n5\noffice dated July 10, 1997, (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit V).  In open court for my review she\noffered an acrylic art piece, a tray, that she had painted using stencil that was quite\nbeautiful.  (Tr. p. 84).      \nThe Applicant has received numerous Certificates of Completion, Certificates of\nAchievement, and other awards for her outstanding performance in various capacities\nthe past.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R).\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, (SF-86)\ndated November 10, 2004, which asked, Question 21, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nconsulted with a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.),\nor have you consulted with another heath care provide about a mental health related\ncondition?\u201d  The Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  The Applicant\nindicated that upon the advise of her attorney she answered the question in that\nmanner.  (Tr. p. 102).  \nQuestion 23(a) of the same application asked the Applicant if he has ever been\ncharged with or convicted of a felony?  The  Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 1).  The Applicant indicated that she consulted with a defense\nattorney who reminded her that she was not convicted and so she answered the\nquestion the way she did.  (Tr. p. 102).    \nOn June 16, 2006, in response to a request by a DoD investigator, the Applicant\nrefused to a sign a medical release for counseling and treatment records concerning her\nhospitalization at Federal Medical Center, Carswell, Fort Worth, Texas.  The Applicant\ngave no excuse for this refusal.  (Tr. p. 103).\nOn September 13, 2007, during an evaluation at the Psychiatric Centers in San\nDiego, the Applicant provided false information to the medical provider by failing to\ndisclose her history of psychiatric treatment and hospitalization in December 1997 and\nfrom January 1998, to March 1998 at the Federal Medical Center, Federal Bureau of\nPrisons, Carswell, Fort Worth, Texas.  The Applicant contends that all she did was stare\nat the physician during the entire visit.  (Tr. p. 105).   \nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nher security clearance application by failing to disclose her psychiatric history and felony\ncharges.  She also failed to cooperate with the DoD authorities during her  background\ninvestigation, by refusing to sign a medical release for her records.  The Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate falsifications in his security clearance application, are violations of Title 18 of\nthe United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\n \n\n6\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline I (Psychological Conditions)\n27. The Concern.  Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required\nfor there to be a concern under this guideline.  A duly qualified mental health\nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by, or acceptable to\nand approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially\ndisqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline.  No negative inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking\nmental health counseling.  \nConditions that could raise security concerns:\n28.(a)  behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to\nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior;\n28.(b)  an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any guideline that may impair judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness; \n28.(c)  the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a diagnosed\nemotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take prescribed medication.\n\n7\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities;\n16.(b) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n8\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct, psychological conditions, and dishonesty\nthat demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), Psychological Conditions\n(Guideline I), and dishonesty (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n9\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J , I and E of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  The Applicant\u2019s\narrest and two felony charges for Threatening a Public Official occurred in October\n1997.  Although she was arrested only once, the series of criminal incidents that led up\nto the charges were extremely serious.  In 2004, she deliberately falsified her security\nclearance application by concealing material information concerning her psychological\nhistory and her felony charges.  By doing so, she committed violations of Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 1001.\nUnder Guideline I, Psychological Conditions, disqualifying conditions 28.(a)\nbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness that\nis not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally\nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior, and 28.(b)\nan opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a\ncondition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, delusions, including a belief\nin a government conspiracy against her.  It was determined that she would need\ntreatment for her illness in the foreseeable future.  However, the Applicant has not been\ncompliant with treatment efforts.  More importantly, she has not been honest with her\ndoctors concerning her condition and therefore they have been unable to make a\nreliable assessment as to whether, based on her current condition, she is or is not\neligible for access to classified information.  Accordingly, without a proper assessment,\ngiven her past diagnosis, I find against the Applicant under this guideline.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct is also very troubling.\nShe has not been honest with the Government in answering questions on her security\nclearance application about her psychological history and her felony charges.  She\ndeliberately tried to conceal the truth.  So much dishonesty confirms to the Government\nthat the Applicant\u2019s credibility is a security concern.  It is obvious that she intentionally\nconcealed this information from the Government, hoping to minimize the seriousness of\nthe matter.  Consequently, her dishonesty with the Government concerning this matter\nis unacceptable.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty\nof clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of her\n\n10\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E or J apply. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.     \nThe Applicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), I (Psychological\nConditions) and E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n11\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary \ndecision to deny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, citing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 3, 2007; answered \nthe SOR in writing on September 6, 2007; and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  DOHA received the request on September 11, 2007. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on September 26, 2007.  The case was assigned to \nan administrative judge on October 16, 2007, and reassigned to me on October 24, \nJanuary 9, 2008\n\n2 \n \n2007, based on workload.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 1, 2007, and \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 14, 2007. The government offered \nexhibits (GX) 1 through 7, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on \nher own behalf and submitted exhibits (AX) A through C, without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until November 30, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional matters.  \nOn November 19, 2007, she submitted AX D and E, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 21, 2007.  \nThe record closed on November 30, 2007.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for assignment to a public trust position is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nThe hearing was convened less than 15 days after the notice of hearing was \nissued.  I advised Applicant of her right under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 to written notice at least \n15 days before the hearing.  Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. \n(Hearing Exhibit I; Tr. 19.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR, with explanations.  Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing \nare incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old appointment clerk employed by a defense contractor \nsupporting a military hospital. She has worked for her current employer since \nSeptember 2005. She has never held a security clearance or received a trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \n \nApplicant was married in 1989 and divorced in 2000.  Her ex-husband died in \n2002. She and her ex-husband agreed to divide their joint obligations, but her ex-\nhusband did not pay his share.  Applicant kept up the payments on of the joint debts \nuntil she became ill.  \n \n \nApplicant underwent surgery for thyroid cancer in August 2003, a second thyroid \nsurgery in November 2004, and a hysterectomy in January 2005 (Tr. 37). She was \nunable to work and fell behind on her debt payments. Her debts increased when she \nused credit cards for living expenses while she was medically unable to work (Tr. 38-39, \n46).  After her thyroid surgery, she became an insulin-dependent diabetic and suffers \nfrom hypertension (Tr. 39).   \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $18,855 that were charged off or \nplaced for collection between December 2003 and December 2005. Applicant admitted \nall the debts and explained that she originally owed about $8,500 but the amounts of the \ndebts rose because of late charges and penalties (Tr. 24).  Her creditors refused to \naccept partial payments (Tr. 39). \n \n\n3 \n \n \nIn January 2006, Applicant moved her ailing father from hospice care to her \nhome where she cared for him until his death in September 2006 (Tr. 60).  In February \n2007, her daughter, who was pregnant with her first child and whose husband was \ndeployed to Iraq, injured her knee and was unable to drive or walk.  Applicant took two \nmonths of leave without pay to care for her daughter (Tr. 38, 62).  Applicant returned to \nwork in April 2007 (Tr. 63).  \n \nApplicant hired a bankruptcy lawyer in 2006, but she was unable to pay his entire \nfee. Instead, she made monthly payments of whatever amount she could afford, starting \nwith a $250 payment in May 2006 (GX 6 at 2; Tr. 68-69).  In January 2007, she \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories about her financial situation and stated she \nintended to file a bankruptcy petition (GX 6 at 3). In February 2007, she responded to \nfurther DOHA interrogatories and stated she was postponing her bankruptcy, because \nshe was taking a leave of absence from work to care for her daughter who was \nundergoing knee surgery (GX 7 at 2). She made her last payment to her lawyer on \nOctober 19, 2007, and her petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed on October 22, \n2007 (AX A and E).   \n \nApplicant and her lawyer could not identify the current owners of some of the \ndebts.  Instead of attempting to track down all the debts, they simply listed in her \nbankruptcy petition all creditors that appeared on her most recent credit reports, except \nfor the holder of the note on her truck, a 1998 Dodge truck with 118,000 miles on it.  (AX \nD; AX E at 14).  Her truck payments are current (Tr. 70, 75). \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a consumer credit counseling course, and \nin November 2007, she completed a course on personal financial management (AX B \nand C).  Both courses were completed by agencies approved by the bankruptcy court. \n \nApplicant closed all her credit card accounts two years ago (Tr. 63).  She has \nbeen meeting all her current financial obligations (Tr. 71).  Her take-home pay is about \n$1,600 per month (Tr. 64).  As of the date of the hearing, her monthly expenses \nincluded a monthly payment of $250 for her truck and $300 for medications, and she \nhad virtually no monthly remainder, had no savings, and was not contributing to any \nretirement plans.  \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant received a raise from $11.05 per hour to $13.98 \nper hour (Tr. 66-67).  She now has medical insurance through her employer.  She is \nenrolled in an indigent program with her hospital because of her history of cancer and \ndiabetes (Tr. 71).      \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (Regulation \u00b6 \n\n4 \n \nC6.1.1.1.) Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. (Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions \nshall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to \nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  (See Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).)  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must \npresent evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \ngovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.) An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant a favorable trustworthiness determination.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n  \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating Financial Considerations is set out in AG & \n18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any \nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the \ndebt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised, because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or \nirresponsible spending.\u201d  However, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, her admitted inability to \npay them, and her use of credit cards to fund basic living expenses that were beyond \nher ability to pay them are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e).  No other \nenumerated disqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised by the evidence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), a disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This is a compound mitigating \ncondition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d or \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d   \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and frequent.  However, they are the \nresult of a confluence of events: her divorce, the death of her ex-husband, her serious \nillness resulting in uninsured medical bills and loss of employment, the illness and death \nof her father, and the injury of her pregnant daughter whose husband was deployed to \nIraq. This confluence of unfortunate events is not likely to recur.  Furthermore, Applicant \nreacted to these events by attempting to pay her debts until she was too ill to work.  She \n\n6 \n \nunsuccessfully attempted to negotiate partial payments.  Her devotion to her family \nmotivated her to care for her father and daughter without regard to her own financial \nneeds.  Under all the circumstances, her financial problems do not cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  I conclude this mitigating condition \nis established. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated \nwhere Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@  Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and \nresponsible conduct, must be established. The events listed in the preceding paragraph \nwere beyond Applicant\u2019s control, and her response to them was reasonable.  I conclude \nthis mitigating condition is established. \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This mitigating condition also has two prongs \nthat may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  If the person has received counseling, it \nmust also be shown that there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or \nunder control.  However, if the person has not received counseling, this mitigating \ncondition may still apply if there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor under control.  Applicant produced evidence of counseling in connection with her \nbankruptcy filing.  She had no financial delinquencies before her illness in 2003. Her \ncurrent financial obligations are up-to-date.  A discharge in bankruptcy will resolve her \nfinancial problems that arose during 2003-2005.  Based on the evidence of record, \nincluding the contents of her bankruptcy petition, there is no reasonable likelihood that \nshe will not receive a discharge in bankruptcy. I conclude this mitigating condition is \nestablished. \n \nThe mitigating condition in AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that \nshows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  A discharge in \nbankruptcy will make her debts uncollectable, but it not \u201crepay\u201d or \u201cresolve\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ndebts within the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(d).  Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 29(d) is not established.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. In addition to the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) \n\n7 \n \nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman who had a clean credit record until her illness in \n2003. At the hearing, she presented herself as somewhat unsophisticated in financial \nmatters, but very candid, sincere, and credible.  Even after her divorce and the death of \nher ex-husband, she kept up the payments on the joint debts from her marriage.  Since \nher employment in 2005, she has lived frugally and within her means.  She has \ndemonstrated her reliability and strong sense of obligation by taking care of her family, \neven though it worked to her financial detriment.  She has lived paycheck to paycheck, \nusing her meager monthly net remainder to pay her lawyer\u2019s fee for the bankruptcy.  \nNow that she has satisfied that obligation, she will have some funds for her eventual \nretirement and for unexpected expenses.   \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy does not establish the mitigating condition in AG \n\u00b6 20(d), it removes her vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \nConsidering the unusual confluence of events that caused her financial problems and \nher reasonable and responsible response to those events, I believe the likelihood that \nher financial problems will recur is nil. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant her eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on each of the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 are set out below. \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \n \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

On December 5, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 1, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for June 25, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nThe Government offered eight exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through\n8, and admitted without objections. Applicant testified and offered three exhibits that were marked\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, and admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on July 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein.

Applicant stated his drinking declined after he left\ncollege to about one to three times per month.5\nApplicant was cited on October 2, 2002, and charged with reckless driving, a misdemeanor.\nAlcohol was not a factor in this incident. Applicant was found guilty on October 21, 2002, and\nsentenced to a $100 fine and $66 in costs, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted or suspended for\na period.  \n6\nApplicant was cited on November 10, 2002, and charged with driving without a license\nendorsement, a misdemeanor. Applicant was driving a motorcycle. He had a driver\u2019s license, but did\nnot have a motorcycle license endorsement. Alcohol was also not a factor in this incident. Applicant\nwas found guilty on January 22, 2003, and sentenced to a $25 fine and $7 in costs.  \n7\nApplicant was arrested on about January 4, 2004, and charged with driving while intoxicated\n(DWI). Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .10%. Applicant was found guilty and\nsentenced on February 3, 2004, to a suspended 30-day jail sentence, a $300 fine and $164 in costs,\n48 hours community service, enroll in a 10 week alcohol safety program, attend a victim\u2019s impact\npanel, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for a year.  \n8\nApplicant successfully completed the court ordered alcohol safety program. He did not drink\nalcohol for the year after his conviction.9\nApplicant testified he drank alcohol for the first time after his 2004 conviction on about\nFebruary 19, 2005. He once again drove after drinking alcohol. Applicant testified he believed he\ndrank three beers and four drinks. He was arrested, and charged with DWI, second offense within\nfive years. His BAC was .13%. Applicant pled guilty to the amended charge of DWI, first offense.\nHe was sentenced on May 17, 2005, to 90 days in jail, with 80 days suspended, a $1,000 fine and\n$211 in costs, enroll in an alcohol safety program, his driver\u2019s license was restricted for a year, and\nhe was required to install an interlock device on his car and pay for the monitoring.  \n10\nApplicant started treatment with a licensed clinical psychologist on February 25, 2005. An\ninitial diagnostic evaluation was performed the same day. The psychologist wrote in a Treatment\nProgress Report dated May 10, 2005, that Applicant \u201cpresented an alcohol abuse problem of\nmoderate severity that is directly related to single lifestyle socialization, identity concerns and\n\nAE A.\n11\nAE B.\n12\nAE C.\n13\nTr. at 40-41.\n14\nGE 8.\n15\nTr. at 42-44.\n16\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant received court approval for\n11\nthis counseling in lieu of the traditional alcohol safety program. Applicant was seen in individual\ncounseling at 32 sessions, through May 1, 2006. Applicant remained abstinent during this period.\nThe psychologist noted Applicant displayed excellent attitude, participation, and involvement,  and\n12\nthat:\nThroughout counseling [Applicant] was fully cooperative and compliant with his\ntreatment plan. He remained abstinent from alcohol and he achieved his treatment\ngoals. Specifically, [Applicant] established a non-drinking socialization and\nrecreational pattern with effective strategies for emotional need fulfillment and he\nsuccessfully resolved identity issues as delineated in the May 10, 2005 Treatment\nProgress Report. [Applicant] successfully completed his individual therapy\nintervention with good realized gains and a good longer term prognosis.  \n13\nAs part of his treatment Applicant also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Applicant\nhas not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous meetings since his treatment ended.14\nApplicant was charged on July 20, 2005, with driving under revocation/suspension. He was\nfound guilty of the amended charge of no driver\u2019s license, a misdemeanor. Applicant was sentenced\nto a $100 fine and $66 in costs.  \n15\nApplicant has returned to drinking alcohol. He estimates his current consumption at once or\ntwice a month. His usually will have two to three beers. On about two occasions he drank five beers.\nApplicant denies driving after drinking any amount of alcohol since his last DWI.16\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n17\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n18\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n19\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n20\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n21\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n5\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n18\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n19\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n20\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n21\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n22\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nThe potential Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) in this case are AC\nDC 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n\n6\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(c)\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(d) (diagnosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of\nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and AC DC 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse\nor dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program).\nApplicant\u2019s charges of possession of alcohol by a person less than 21 years of age, and two\nDWIs establish AC DC 22(a). Applicant admitted his drinking at one point constituted \u201cbinge\ndrinking.\u201d AC DC 22(c) is established. I accept the report by Applicant\u2019s licensed clinical\npsychologist as a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. AC DC 22(d) is established. I do not find that\nApplicant\u2019s return to drinking in moderation constitutes a \u201crelapse.\u201d AC DC 22(f) has not been\nestablished.\nThere are three potential Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC DC) in this case,\nAC DC 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AC DC 23(b) (the individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser)), and AC DC 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).\nApplicant has three alcohol-related incidents, including two DWIs. His last DWI was in\nFebruary 2005. He continues to drink alcohol. Because of his number of incidents of poor judgment,\nI am unable to make an affirmative finding that Applicant\u2019s alcohol incidents are unlikely to recur,\nand do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AC DC 23(a)\ndoes not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his issues of alcohol abuse. He provided evidence of actions taken\nto overcome his problem. Applicant did not drink for the year after his first DWI. He did not drink\nagain from February 2005 through at least May 2006. He has returned to drinking alcohol, but\nwithout any adverse incidents. There is no evidence of irresponsible use. Applicant has established\na pattern of responsible use. I find AC DC 23(b) is applicable, but Applicant does not merit as much\nconsideration under this mitigating condition because of the relatively short duration of the pattern\nof responsible use.\nApplicant successfully completed outpatient counseling and has received a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. In order to receive full application of AC DC\n23(d), Applicant must also demonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified consumption in\naccordance with treatment recommendations. This mitigating condition would appear to require\nmore than AC DC 23(b), which only requires an applicant to establish a pattern of responsible use,\n\n7\nas opposed to a clear and established pattern of modified consumption. I found the former; I do not\nfind the latter. Based upon Applicant\u2019s record of remaining abstinent for about a year, and then\ncommitting another DWI, as well as his incidents of poor judgment, I do not find that Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent period without an alcohol-related incident is sufficient to qualify as a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption. AC DC 23(d) is partially applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related incidents, including two DWIs. He complied with all\ncourt requirements, including alcohol counseling. He has abused alcohol, but is not alcohol\ndependent. Applicant\u2019s licensed clinical psychologist gave him a favorable prognosis. He has\nreturned to drinking alcohol without further incident. \nWhen I consider the evidence in light of the adjudicative process factors, I also considered\nApplicant\u2019s other involvement with the law, and specifically how they relate to the allegations in the\nSOR. When Applicant committed his first DWI, his underage possession of alcohol charge had\nalready been dismissed, but he had two non-alcohol related misdemeanor traffic convictions. He\ncommitted his second DWI about 13 \u00bd months after his first DWI, and only a few weeks after the\ncourt restrictions were lifted. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was again restricted for a year after his\nsecond DWI. Within a few months of his second DWI conviction, Applicant was charged with\ndriving under revocation/suspension, and ultimately convicted of the misdemeanor charge of no\ndriver\u2019s license. It appears Applicant has developed a pattern of committing a criminal act,\ncomplying with court ordered requirements, and then lapsing into unlawful behavior. Applicant has\nnot been incident-free long enough to show the presence of rehabilitation. Without an extended\npattern of incident-free conduct, it is too early to conclude this pattern will not continue. The\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of incidents of questionable judgment remains significant.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his alcohol consumption.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was arrested or charged with six alcohol-related incidents between 1999 and\nOctober 2005.  At the time of his April 2005 public drunkenness charge his blood alcohol content\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nwas 0.23.  Even though he has reduced his alcohol consumption, no longer associates with college\nacquaintances, and has changed his priorities in life, the record evidence is insufficient to mitigate\nor extenuate the negative security implications stemming from alcohol consumption. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 15, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct security concerns.\nOn January 8, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and stated he did not wish to have a\nhearing. A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared on March 30, 2007.  On May 30, 2007,\nApplicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel having no objection to the material\nsubmitted by Applicant, the documents were admitted into evidence. On June 6, 2007, I was\nassigned the case. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct.\nApplicant admits to the following: that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess, which resulted in\nintoxication starting in 1995 and ending in October 2005.  In July 1999, Applicant was charged with\ndisorderly conduct, found guilty, and fined $335.  In December 2003 and May 2004, he was charged\nwith public drunkenness, found guilty, and fined approximately $217 and $197, respectively.  In\nOctober 2004, he was cited for having an open container of alcohol, found guilty, and fined $80.\nIn April 2005, he was charged with public drunkenness with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of\n0.23%.  He pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined $218.  In October 2005, he was charged with\npublic drunkenness after having consumed 20 beers.  He was found not guilty because the incident\noccurred on private property.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\nthorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems analysis who has worked for a defense contractor since\nOctober 2005 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  His professor states he is impressed by\nthe level of effort Applicant has put into his classes and toward obtaining his M.S. degree.  His\nprofessor believes Applicant is a dedicated, determined, reliable and hard-working student.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor states Applicant has a strong work ethic and has become a dedicated working\nprofessional.  Applicant often works late to ensure assigned tasks are completed timely.  Applicant\nconsistently exceeds his production requirement and has become a valued member of the team.\nApplicant\u2019s priest believes Applicant is an extremely mature and serious person. \n\n3\nApplicant admits he has abused alcohol in the past.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol usage occurred\n\u201cperiodically to somewhat frequently in high school, and became habitual in college.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to FORM) Applicant states he has \u201clearned to limit my alcohol consumption to social\nsituations and don\u2019t consume alcohol nearly to the extent that I have in the past.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to FORM) Applicant has discussed his past alcohol arrests and problems with his priest.\nIn June 2005, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, Standard\nForm (SF) 85. (Item 6)  Question 14 asked him if he had used marijuana during the previous year.\nHe answered \"No\" to the question.  Applicant interpreted this question to mean was he currently\nusing drugs.  He used marijuana during college, but was neither addicted to it nor a habitual user of\nit.  He last used marijuana in late April 2005 or early May 2005.  Applicant asserts his action \u201cwas\npurely a mistake of an irresponsible college kid, who blew threw the questionnaire without giving\nit the attention that it deserved.  I regret making this mistake and fully intend to be more attentive\nand assertive when filling out similar questionnaires.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM)\nIn October 2005, Applicant completed an SF 86, but this time indicated he had used\nmarijuana from August 2001 to May 2005. (Item 5, page 31) In July 2006, Applicant disclosed his\ndrug use to an investigator to correct the mistake of the omission.  The record is silent as to whether\nhe volunteered this information without being asked about his drug usage or if it was in response\nto a specific inquiry by the investigator. \nIn April 2005, Applicant was arrested for public drunkenness having a BAC of 0.23%.\nApplicant saw this arrest as an eye opening experience.  He was nearing the end of this college\nexperience and decided he needed to create a more positive future for himself.  He vowed to change\nhis life.  In October 2005, he returned to his college to attend a football game.  He consumed 20\nbeers and was again arrested for public drunkenness.  Applicant saw his arrest as a wake-up call.\nIt made him realize he was \"screwing up (his) life and jeopardizing (his) future.\" (Item 4, page 2)\nIn January 2006, Applicant started on his Masters Degree in electrical engineering while\nworking full time.  In June 2006, he was promoted.  In July 2006, his work performance was good\nenough for him to be allowed to work 10 hours of overtime per biweekly period.  His work quality\ncontinued to improve and he was approved for 32 hours of overtime per biweekly period. In the\nSpring of 2007, due to his work performance he was approved for the maximum overtime per\nbiweekly period of 40 hours.\nAlso in June 2006, he moved into his own apartment and is now paying $1,279 per month\nrent.  He also pays for his schooling from his salary.  In March 2006, Applicant met a woman and\nis now engaged to be married in July 2007.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Alcohol Consumption and Personal\nConduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Alcohol Consumption,\nGuideline G.  A history of excessive alcohol consumption raises a security concern because of the\npotential for deliberate or inadvertent mishandling of classified information due to intoxication.\nExcessive alcohol consumption is of concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment, criminal conduct, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  The record evidence raises\na security concern under this guideline. \nBetween July 1999 and October 2005, Applicant was arrested or citied six times for alcohol-\nrelated incidents. The majority of the arrest occurred when Applicant was a college student. It is\n\n5\nnoted at the time of his April 2005 arrest Applicant\u2019s BAC was 0.23%, which is very high.\nDisqualifying conditions (DC) a (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other criminal incidents\nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent) and c ( habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) apply.\n \nNone of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply.  MC a (so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply.  It has only been a year and a half since his last arrest, his conduct was\nnot infrequent, and the drinking did not occur under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur even though he no longer associates with his college friends. \nApplicant acknowledges he has had issues of alcohol abuse in the past.  However, MC b (the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)) does not apply because the record is silent as\nto Applicant\u2019s current  use. Applicant states he has learned to limit his alcohol consumption to social\nsituations and do not consume alcohol nearly to the extent that he did in the past. From that\nstatement it is impossible to conclude he has established \u201cresponsible use\u201d of alcohol. \nApplicant has talked to his priest about his past arrests and alcohol incidents, but the record\nfails to establish these talks are a counseling or treatment program.  Therefore MC c (the individual\nis a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of\nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress) and MC d (the individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required\naftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence\nin accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program) do not apply.\nApplicant has denied being cited with an alcohol violation in June 1999.  The record fails\nto establish this event occurred.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.b.\nBecause of the six alcohol-related incidents, the last of which occurred less than two years\nago, and because none of the mitigating conditions apply, I find against Applicant as to Alcohol\nConsumption. \nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal\nConduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when\nthat applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the\nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of\napplicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful\nsecurity clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision\nis susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation\u2019s security. The nature of Applicant\u2019s actions, in\nproviding false information on his June 2005 SF 85 poses a serious potential risk to the nation\u2019s\n\n6\nsecurity precautions. DC a (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)\napplies. \nOn the June 2005 SF 85, Question 14, Illegal Drugs, asked a straight forward question: in\nthe last year, had the Applicant used or possessed illegal drugs, which included marijuana.  Even\nthough Applicant had last used in late April or early May 2005 he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question.\nHe says this was not an intentional falsification and he was not trying to mislead. Applicant\ninterpreted the question to ask if \u201che currently used drugs.\u201d  He says it happened because he was an\nirresponsible college kid, who blew threw the questionnaire without giving it the attention that it\ndeserved. Having used marijuana a month to six weeks prior to completion of the questionnaire, the\nevent should have been sufficiently fresh in his mind to disclose it. The wording is clear and\nunambiguous.\nIn October 2005, four months after completing has SF 85, he completed an SF 86, but this\ntime indicated he had used marijuana from August 2001 to May 2005. Before completing this\nquestionnaire he had not been confronted about his drug usage.  MC a (the individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts) applies.  I find for Applicant as to the personal conduct security concerns. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, this decision\nshould not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of\nreform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance. Should Applicant\nbe afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future and he continues on his\npresent course with no future adverse alcohol related incidents, he may well demonstrate persuasive\nevidence of security worthiness.  But that time has not yet arrived.  Because the Applicant meets the\ndisqualifying conditions and none of the mitigating conditions, the Alcohol Considerations security\nconcern is resolved against the Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nClaude R.

He charged thousands of dollars on these accounts. She successfully challenged the legitimacy\nof several debts and paid the remaining debts. She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns  under\nGuideline F about her trustworthiness. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 19, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\").  On November 3, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust position. Specifically, the SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On December 27, 2006, Applicant submitted a\nnotarized response to the allegations. She requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on February 9, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on March\n2, 2007. The March 21, 2007 hearing proceeded as scheduled after Applicant waived her right to 15\ndays notice of the hearing date. The government submitted four exhibits (GE), which were marked\nand admitted into the record as GE 1-4 without objection. Applicant submitted 23 exhibits (App Ex),\nwhich were marked and admitted into the record as App Ex A-J and L-X without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g under\nGuideline F, but denied the remaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein.\nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 48-year-old woman seeking a position of public trust, works as a claims analyst\nfor a Department of Defense contractor.

She has neither a mortgage on her home nor a car payment for her\ntwo cars. She has one credit card on which her payments are current.3\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated November 30, 2005, October 5, 2006, February\n7, 2007, and the SOR shows 7 unpaid debts totaling $58,413.

After some\nmonths of dating, he moved into her home. About a year after he started living with her, she realized\nhe had been using her credit information to obtain additional credit cards in her name. He charged\nhigh debt on these cards and did not pay the debt. He stole her identity while living with her. Despite\nno active assistance from the local police and her fear of harm from this man, she finally forced him\n\nTr. at 47-52.

At the hearing, she\ndemonstrated a fearfulness of him, even though he no longer has any involvement in her life.8\nApplicant\u2019s parents died in 2006, leaving her and her sister a farm, which is worth several\nmillion dollars. They also left cash and other liquid assets to their daughters. Applicant used some\nof her inheritance to pay the debts she acknowledged and to pay the remaining mortgage on her\nhouse.9\nAfter receiving the SOR in November 2006, Applicant wrote to the three major credit\nbureaus, challenging the debts listed in allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.d and 1.f. As a result, the credit bureaus\ninvestigated these accounts and deleted all challenged accounts except allegation 1.f, which is still\nbeing investigated.10\nApplicant\u2019s performance reviews for the last three years reflect that in 2005, she received a\nrating of 4.1, and in 2006, a rating of 4.5 because her work \u201csometimes exceeds expectations\u201d. In\n2007, she received a rating of 4.6 because she \u201cconsistently exceeds expectations\u201d. Applicant\u2019s\nfriends and co-workers describe her as a valuable team member, conscientious, honest, trustworthy,\ninnovative, and loyal.11\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n12\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n13\n Id.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n19\n5\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n13\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n14\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n15\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n16\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n17\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\"  Any doubt\n18\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n19\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe remaining financial considerations mitigating conditions set forth in AG 20 (a) and AG 20 (b) do not\n20\napply in this case.\n6\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect several old,\nlarge, unpaid debts. Because of the age of these debts and their delinquent status, Applicant showed\nan inability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based on the evidence of record, the government\nestablished the applicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant developed a trusting relationship with a man who kept his true motives for their\nrelationship a secret. Being a con man, he used her trust to steal her identify and create credit issues\nfor her. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies.\nAlthough Applicant never met with a financial counselor, she contacted the creditors to whom\nshe owed money and made arrangements to pay her debts in full. She used her inheritance to pay the\nremaining balance on her mortgage and to pay her just debts. She has acted in good faith to resolve\nher unpaid debts. She otherwise lives within her financial means. MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. \nShe denied owing the debts alleged in paragraphs 1.a, 1.b,1.d, and 1.f of the SOR, stating that\nthese debts were created by her former boyfriend, whom she fears, when he used her name to obtain\ncredit, then charged numerous purchases on the credit cards he obtained. Upon receipt of the SOR,\nshe successfully challenged the validity of three debts, which have been removed from her credit\nhistory. The fourth debt is still being investigated by the creditor reporting agency. MC \u00b6 20 (e) the\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue applies.  Applicant paid her old debts with money she\n20\nreceived from her inheritance. Thus, MC \u00b6 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source applies.\nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline F is found\nin favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n21\n7\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nApplicant performs her duties exceedingly well and is highly respected by her co-workers for\nher work ethic and integrity. Until she became involved with the con man a few years ago, she could\npay the debts she incurred. This relationship created serious financial problems for her, which have\nnow been resolved. She recently received a significant inheritance, but has not changed her life style.\nShe continues to live as she did in the past, modestly. Her bills are paid in a timely fashion. There is\nvery little likelihood that she will engage in illegal acts to generate funds, as she is financially solvent.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in\nthe context of the whole person,  I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns\n21\npertaining to her finances. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is granted.\nMary E. Henry\nAdministrative Judge\n",
