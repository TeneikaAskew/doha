Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\nOn January 5, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF\n86) to request or renew a security clearance for her employment with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On October 28, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR). The SOR specified the basis for DOHA\u2019s decision \u2013 facts\nwhich raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative\nMay 21, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included ten documents (Items 1 - 10) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case. I have specifically not considered Items 9 and 10, as they pertain to criminal\nconduct not alleged in this case. Department Counsel proffered that the information \u201cundercuts any potential\nmitigation Applicant may submit in response to this FORM.\u201d (FORM, page 4) However, that assertion does\nnot provide a sufficient basis for admissibility under the Directive or the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE),\nwhich serve as a guide in these proceedings (Directive, E3.1.19). Because there is no showing here that the\ncriminal conduct involved \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft,\ncheck fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other\nintentional financial breaches of trust was a matter of financial misconduct\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(d)), it is excluded as\nirrelevant (FRE 401 and 402) and unduly prejudicial and inflammatory (FRE 403).\n2\nGuidelines (AG).  More specifically, the government alleged that Applicant owed\n2\n$39,521 for 17 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q). It also alleged Applicant deliberately\nfalsified her SF 86 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 35 (property repossessions in the last\nseven years), question 38 (delinquencies greater than 180 days past due in the last\nseven years), and question 39 (currently more than 90 days past due on any debt)\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c). On December 17, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and admitted\nwithout explanation all of the allegations therein. She requested a decision without a\nhearing.\nOn January 8, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on February 18, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response to\nthe FORM. She submitted nothing before the deadline, and the case was assigned to\nme on May 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the\ngovernment\u2019s FORM and the exhibits therein, I make the following additional findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nDecember 2004. Since April 2000, she has worked for 13 different employers as an\n\u201capplications packager.\u201d Her current job title is \u201cpackage scripter,\u201d but there is no\ndescription of what type of work this involves. Applicant separated from her husband on\nor about January 1, 2004, after being married since June 2001. She was previously\ninvestigated for a security clearance for a job she had with the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigations (FBI) in 1996 and 1997. (FORM, Item 4)\nAfter Applicant submitted her SF 86, government investigators obtained two\nreports of her credit history (FORM, Items 5 and 6), which showed Applicant owed\napproximately $40,000 for 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o, 1.q) accrued between\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\n2003 and 2006. One of the debts listed is for an unpaid auto loan for which a vehicle\nwas repossessed. As of January 2003, there was a balance past due of $2,587 on a\n$23,000 loan. Credit reports obtained by DOHA adjudicators (FORM, Items 7 and 8)\nrevealed an additional unpaid debt for $82 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) accrued in 2007, and showed\nApplicant still owed the debts reflected in earlier reports.\nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 86 in 2005, she answered \u201cno\u201d to all of the\nquestions about her finances in the past seven years. (FORM, Item 4) She has not\nexplained why she failed to disclose her debts greater than 90 or 180 days past due, or\nthat her car was repossessed in 2003. \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15 and Guideline F (financial considerations) at\nAG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n Department Counsel urges application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused\n8\nby frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt\nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt) and AG \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one's means, which\nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or\nother financial analysis). (FORM, page 4) However, because no statement was taken from Applicant either\nby investigators or through interrogatories, there is no information about how these debts arose, about her\ncurrent income (e.g., a Personal Financial Statement), or about what, if anything, she is doing about the debts.\nAccordingly, there is no basis for application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(e).\n4\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has admitted without explanation all of the SOR allegations.\nAccordingly, there are no controverted issues of fact. Further, the government\npresented sufficient reliable information to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q\nthat Applicant has, since 2003, accrued 17 delinquent debts totaling about $40,100.\nAccording to a January 2008 credit bureau report, the debts appeared to be still unpaid.\nThese facts support application of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).  \n8\nThe government satisfied its burden of producing sufficient reliable evidence to\nsupport the SOR. In response, Applicant has submitted no information that would\n\n5\nsupport application of any of the mitigating conditions under this guideline. Accordingly,\nshe has not mitigated the security concerns about his finances.\nPersonal Conduct.\nAs stated in AG \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d The Applicant admitted without explanation the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c that she deliberately falsified her SF 86 when she answered \u201cno\u201d to SF 86\nquestions 35 (repossessions), 38 (debts greater than 180 days delinquent) and 39\n(debts greater than 90 days past due), respectively. At the time she signed her SF 86,\nthereby certifying that her answers were true, she had owed for more than 180 days\napproximately $19,000 for the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o\n(reference in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.ab and 2.c to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p is concluded for Applicant\nas that debt was accrued nearly two years after the SF 86 was submitted). She had also\nhad a car repossessed in 2003, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are significant and required a positive response to questions\n35, 38, and 39. Absent some explanation by Applicant (which she has not provided) to\nshow mistake or some other information probative of her intent at the time she signed\nthe SF 86, it must be concluded she knowingly and willfully falsified her answers in the\nSF 86 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c. The facts and circumstances presented here\nrequire application of the disqualifying condition listed at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).\nThe government satisfied its burden of producing sufficient reliable evidence to\nsupport the SOR. In response, Applicant has submitted no information that would\nsupport application of any of the mitigating conditions under this guideline. Accordingly,\nshe has not mitigated the security concerns about her personal conduct. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Aside from information about her\nage, education, and employment history contained in her SF 86, there is nothing on\nwhich to base application of any of these factors. At 29 years old, she is presumed to be\na mature adult. However, there is no available information about her current finances,\nthe reasons she has not paid the listed debts, why she will not incur delinquencies in the\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n6\nfuture, or why she apparently falsified her SF 86. A fair and commonsense assessment9\nof all of available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances and candor shows there\nare doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\nBecause the protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations,\nthese doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn April 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2008, admitting the allegation and\nelecting a decision on the written record instead of a hearing. Department Counsel\nmailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant on January 9,\n2009. He received it January 21, 2009. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. On March 9,\n2009, he submitted a response to the FORM. He did not object to any of the\nMarch 27, 2009\n\n2\nsubmissions in the FORM. The case was assigned to me March 12, 2009. Based on a\nreview of the FORM, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old, single man. He is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, serving\nfrom 1973 to 1975. He was honorably discharged. In 1989, he earned a bachelor of\nscience degree. The FORM does not indicate his major. Since 1990, he has worked for\na defense contractor as a test engineer. He has held a security clearance continuously\nduring this time.\nOn or about July 12, 1995, Applicant drove his automobile in the wrong direction\ndown a one-way street, and collided with another vehicle. The police, upon arriving,\nadministered a blood alcohol test to Applicant, which he failed, registering a .14 (Item 8\nat 2). He was then arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DUI). \nThe court issued a notice of arraignment to Applicant on September 5, 1995\nscheduling the arraignment for November 22, 1995 (Item 9). Applicant failed to appear,\nas scheduled, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest (Items 10, 11). The warrant\nremains open (Item 2).\nThe government propounded interrogatories to Applicant on August 29, 2007\n(Item 5). Applicant stated he attempted to contact the court in 1996 concerning the open\nwarrant, and received no response. He stated he would retain an attorney, surrender to\nthe authorities, and resolve the matter (Item 5 at 2).\nIn response to the FORM, Applicant attributed his failure to respond to the bench\nwarrant to mental stress, and his preoccupation with various family crises.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s failure to appear at a 1995 criminal arraignment, and his continued failure to\nrespond to an outstanding arrest warrant trigger AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime.\u201d\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior demonstrates a disrespect for the law and a refusal to accept responsibility for\nhis actions. His lack of contrition is particularly troubling. The Criminal Conduct security\nconcern remains unmitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s failure to appear at a pre-trial criminal hearing, his continued failure to\nresolve the matter, and his nonchalant attitude about the legal ramification of his\nactions, as reflected in his Response to the FORM, render him an unacceptable security\nrisk. I considered the whole person factors in my analysis of the Criminal Conduct\nguideline, and my analysis does not support a favorable outcome. Clearance is denied.\n\n4\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 20, 2007. The SOR is\nequivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.\nThe issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a\nhistory of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 31, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\nhearing took place as scheduled on January 30, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on February 7, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 15, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The five-\npage post-hearing exhibit is marked and admitted as Exhibit E. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.   \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts ranging from $45 to\n$7,175 for about $18,585. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations except for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, which he denied. Also, he\nprovided a short explanation about the origin of his financial problems and his remedial\nactions. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old systems analyst for a company engaged in defense\ncontracting. He has worked for his current employer since October 2005. He worked in\nthe same position for a different company from April 2004 to October 2005. In addition,\nhis employment history includes approximately 20 years of active duty military service in\nthe U.S. Navy until his retirement in 2004. When he retired, he was serving as chief\npetty officer (paygrade E-7). He held a security clearance, without problems, for many\nyears in the Navy. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute (Exhibits\n2 and 3). For example, an April 2006 credit report reveals a judgment for $1,934, 30\ntrade accounts of which 14 contain adverse information (past due, bad debt, etc.), and 7\ncollection accounts (Exhibit 3).\nHe attributes the origin of his financial problems to the 1999\u20132001 period when\nhe was on active duty in the Navy (Response to SOR). In August 1999, he received\ntransfer orders to a large naval base and then deployed overseas shortly thereafter.\nThese circumstances resulted in Applicant being unable to move his family to his new\nduty location for about 18 months due to his deployment schedule. During this time he\n\n3\nincurred additional expenses and lost control of his finances. In time, his financial\nproblems grew worse due to the effect of snowballing. \nApplicant addressed the 11 debts alleged in the SOR during his hearing\ntestimony. The status of the accounts is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013collection account for $7,175.\nIn repayment program; current balance of\n$4,013 (Exhibits A and E). \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013charged-off account for\n$2,880.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A). \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013collection account for $1,223.\nReduced to judgment for $1,934 in 2004;\npaid off in 2006 (Exhibits 1 and E at 1; Tr.\n75\u201378).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013collection account for $2,928.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and\n1.k\u2013collection accounts for $109, $199,\n$136, $89, $93, and $45 for total of $671.\nWill pay via a $2,500 loan against his\n401(k) account; loan paperwork was\nbeing processed when the record closed\n(Exhibits D and E). \nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013collection account for $3,708.\nIn repayment plan (Exhibit A). \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the indebtedness in SOR \u00b6 1.a\nbecause a collection lawsuit for this debt was dismissed in June 2006 (Exhibit C).\nFurther research, however, revealed that the debt is still outstanding with a balance of\n$4,013, and it was added to the repayment program (Exhibit E at 1, 4, and 5). \nIn December 2007, Applicant engaged a company to serve as a debt-\nmanagement agent for three creditors (Exhibit A). With the addition of the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.a, it now covers four creditors for about $13,350. He paid the set-up fees and paid the\ninitial monthly payment of $201 (Exhibits A and B). It is estimated to be a 24-month\nplan.\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant is in a repayment agreement with\nthe IRS for tax year 2005 (Tr. 55). He owed the IRS about $900 due to under\nwithholding of taxes from his military retirement pay. He is paying $40 monthly to\nresolve this obligation. Applicant is also indebted to the Defense Department for minor\ndamages to military housing when he retired in 2004 (Tr. 56). He now owes about $300\nand is paying $40 monthly to resolve it. He is also making $227 monthly payments on a\ncar loan, and he has three credit card accounts, all of which are current. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial condition is fairly described as living month-to-month.\nIncluding his retirement pay, his net monthly income is about $4,280 with monthly\n\n Department of Navy v.

The couple have\ntwo adult children. His wife has not worked on a regular basis since 1997 (Tr. 78\u201379).\nAlso, she has had medical problems resulting in out-of-pocket expenses. His 20-year-\nold son is a full-time college student and lives with Applicant. His 25-year-old\nstepdaughter and her child live across the street from Applicant. As a result, Applicant\nand his wife provide some financial support to each child. Both Applicant\u2019s wife and son\nare attending college on scholarships thereby reducing educational expenses. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n5\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n Revised Guidelines at p. 14. \n18\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n19\n6\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.\nGuideline F contains six conditions that could mitigate the security concerns.18\nThe most pertinent is the fourth MC, as it requires a person to initiate a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  He has made decent efforts to\n19\nresolve the delinquent debts as established by the table above. The six collection\naccounts for a total of about $671 will be repaid in the near future via the 401(k) loan,\nwhich was being processed when the record closed. The four major debts for a total of\nabout $13,350 are being addressed through the repayment plan. And the judgment for\n$1,934 was paid off in 2006. With the retirement pay and current salary, he has\nsufficient income to pay for his family\u2019s living expenses and other recurring obligations.\nHis efforts are sufficient to constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of the\nguideline.\nThis case has also been considered under the whole-person concept. Applicant\nis 49 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances. He\nhas demonstrated his maturity and good judgment by taking positive, concrete actions\nto address his history of the financial problems. To that end, Applicant has (1) a realistic\nand workable plan to resolve his financial problems, (2) documented actions taken in\nfurtherance of the plan, and (3) shown a measurable improvement to the situation. It\nappears Applicant is working seriously to resolve his indebtedness. In addition,\nApplicant has 20 years of honorable military service and retired as a Navy chief petty\nofficer. This circumstance strongly suggests that Applicant has the requisite self-control,\ngood judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to properly handle and safeguard\nclassified information.  \nTo conclude, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\nand unfavorable, and I have no doubts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. Although he should have acted sooner to address his financial\nproblems and did not present a perfect case in mitigation, he presented sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.\nApplicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.k\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He further testified that he has been making payments on\nthis debt since 2001, and Exhibit C shows that as October 31, 2007, he had reduced the\ndebt to $3,603. He has made additional payments since then reducing this debt further. \nFinally, because Applicant  was providing care for his child, he testified that the\ncourt had ordered the mother of his child to pay the arrearage for the child\u2019s previous\nsupport.  Exhibit J, includes a copy of a Judgment Regarding Parental Obligations,\ndated December 7, 2007, in which the court ordered the mother to pay $13,688 for the\nperiod of support of the life of the child, confirming that Applicant should not have been\nthe one responsible for child custody, since he was the custodial parent. The mother is\nnow ordered to pay Applicant $255 a month in child support plus $75 a month for\narrearage. I  find that regarding this debt, Applicant has been acting responsibly in this\ndifficult situation. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,327.\nApplicant testified that he had made a payment of settlement on this debt. A credit\nreport, dated October 11, 2007, (Exhibit 2) shows a \u201csettlement accepted on this\naccount.\u201d The problem is that Applicant has at least two accounts to this creditor and it\nis not clear what the settlement has been accepted for and what, if anything,  remains.\n\n3\nIn Exhibit J, Applicant avers that he has been in contact with the credit collection agency\nfor these debts , but they were not helpful on what debts are still owed. Based on the\ncredit report, I find that at least one of the debts to this creditor is still outstanding.\n1.c. This second overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$482. As discussed in 1.b., above either 1b. or 1.c. has not yet been resolved, while the\nother debt has been paid. The evidence does not establish which is the outstanding\ndebt, in Exhibit J, Applicant indicated that he plans to re-contact the credit collector, and\nresolve this issue.  \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $41. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that he had made a payment on this phone bill, and he\nbelieved that this debt was resolved. In his post hearing submission, (Exhibit J)\nApplicant said to resolve this debt he made a payment on this debt, and this debt has\nnow been satisfied.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,208.\nApplicant explained that this debt is to an attorney, whom Applicant hired to help him\ngain custody of his daughter, during a period when he believed the child\u2019s mother was\nabusing the child. He indicated that he paid him an initial retention fee of $2,500 and\nthen an additional $1,000, but Applicant has disputed this bill because he believes that\nthis attorney did not perform the services for which was paid, including appearing in\ncourt. Applicant testified that he is now paying $75 a month on this debt. Exhibit D\nincludes letters from a collection agency, showing that Applicant is paying $75 a month\nfor this debt and for the debts listed as 1.f. and 1.g., below.  \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,138.\nThis debt was for another attorney, who was employed by Applicant for the same\npurpose, but whom Applicant believed also did not performs his services. The $75 a\nmonth Applicant is paying as discussed in 1.d., above, is also for this debt. While\nApplicant does not believe either attorney fulfilled his obligations to warrant being paid,\nhe is resolving these debt. \n1.g. This second overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$995.  This is also being resolved by the $75 a month payment. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $470. At\nthe hearing, Applicant first testified that he was not aware of whom this creditor is, so he\ndid not believe he owed this debt. Later during the hearing, Applicant realized who the\noriginal creditor was, and he testified that he has paid this debt.  In Exhibit J, Applicant\nindicates that he contacted the listed creditor, and he sent a copy of an accounting to\nthe collection agency and attached one to Exhibit J, showing that this debt had been\npaid in full. I find that this debt has been resolved.  \n1.i. Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in 1998 for a Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy, in which he claimed liabilities of $8,950, and assets of $1,760. The SOR\nalleges that the bankruptcy was dismissed. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he\n\n4\nbelieved his debts had been discharged in the bankruptcy, because he had not been\nfurther contacted by his creditors, but he had no evidence to support his belief. A credit\nreport, Exhibit 4, shows that this bankruptcy was dismissed. \nApplicant cited several reasons for his financial difficulties, which will be\ndiscussed below. He sustained a serious back injury in October 1997, which required\nsurgery, and kept him from being able to work from November 1998 until 2000. He was\nalso a single parent, and he continued paying child support. \nApplicant testified that he is not overdue on any of his current debts. He does not\nown any credit cards. His wife, who is employed, is on maternity leave at this time. \nFinally, Applicant also offered into evidence four letters from individuals who\nknow or have known him for many years in his professional and /or private life. (Exhibit\nG). They spoke in extremely laudatory terms, describing him as trustworthy, reliable and\nhard working.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s serious back injury that resulted in\n\n6\nsurgery and loss of employment. Applicant  acted responsibly in continuing to take care\nof his children while injured, and ultimately he has continued making an good faith effort\nto resolve these overdue debts. l find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant is now more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude that he has mitigated the financial concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn September 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 15, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 21, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 21, 2008, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself)\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 29, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of the status of her disputed debts (including payment history\non those debts she claims to have paid).  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted\n14 days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented\nthe record with a letter to Department Counsel covering a number of the listed debts\nand documentation of payments on her creditor 1.h debt (an identified utility debt).  Her\npost-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 12 debts exceeding\n$35,000.00.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the alleged debts,\nand denied the remaining three debts. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old engineering analyst for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  As a result of her employer\u2019s recent downsizing, she\ndoesn\u2019t believe she requires a security clearance anymore (R.T., at 37-38).  Still, she\nsigns for packages that could contain classified materials, and to date, her company has\nnot withdrawn its request for her security clearance.  The allegations covered in the\nSOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant was married for 11 years before divorcing her husband (H) in January\n1988 (ex. 1).  She has one child (albeit, not from her marriage); a daughter (age 20)\nwho lives at home.  Her daughter currently works part time for a doctor and attends a\nlocal community college.  She hopes to enroll in a four-year college in Fall 2008 (R.T.,\nat 35-36).  Applicant has provided financial support for her daughter, who lives at home,\nand will continue to do so while she attends college.\nApplicant struggled financially as a single parent following her divorce in 1988.\nWith little financial support from her daughter\u2019s biological father, she filed for disability in\n1995 and briefly considered filing for bankruptcy (R.T., at 84-85). The bankruptcy lawyer\nshe consulted with at the time suggested she would be better off addressing her bills\nindividually.  She accepted his advice. Over the course of the ensuing 10 years, she\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts, some during an eight-month period of\nunemployment following a lay-off in 2003 (R.T., at 36-37).\n\n3\nApplicant incurred seven major debts between1999 and 2005 that collectively\nexceed $14,000.00.  She opened a furniture account with creditor 1.b in 2004 and\nmade furniture purchases on this account in the same year.  Credit records report a\n$757.00 outstanding balance (ex. 2), which Applicant does not dispute (R.T., at 42-43).\nIn 1999, she leased an apartment, which she later vacated.  The lessor (creditor 1.c)\ncharged her two months of rent for breaking the lease and reports $2,398.00 still owing\non her 2007 credit report (see exs. 2 and 3).  She became indebted, too, to a local bank\nin 2003 for an overdraft debt, which her credit report lists as unsatisfied in the amount of\n$1,066.00, as of August 2007 (creditor 1.a).  She acknowledges, too, another overdraft\naccount (creditor 1.e).  While she disputes this debt (claiming it was resolved in 2006), it\ncontinues to be carried in her 2007 credit report as an outstanding debt (albeit charged\noff). Afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with payment records, Applicant\nprovides no documentary payment proof (such as payment histories, bank\ncorrespondence, canceled checks, and/or deposit slips) to support her payment claims\ncovering either of these overdraft accounts.  \nBesides her aforementioned debts, Applicant incurred a significant auto loan\n(creditor 1.j) in connection with a new Mitsubishi vehicle she purchased in August 2000\nfor $17,676.00 (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 66-73).  Records report that Applicant\npurchased the vehicle in April 2000 for $20,377.00 (see ex. 2).  She made monthly\npayments of $324.00 for about three years; her collective payments exceeded\n$12,000.00 (R.T., at 71).  Experiencing prolonged unemployment in 2003-2004, she\nwas unable to continue making her payments.  Before she returned to work in May 2004\n(with her current employer), the lender (creditor 1.j) repossessed the Mitsubishi and sold\nit at public auction.  After crediting her account with the proceeds from the sale of the\nvehicle, the lender claimed a deficiency balance.  This deficiency was reportedly\nassigned to a collection agent (creditor 1.k) who claims a deficiency balance owing of\n$8,775.00 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 73-81).  Presumably, the deficiency includes accumulated\ninterest and fees.  Applicant did make several unsuccessful attempts to forestall the\nrepossession with a payment arrangement, but the company refused (R.T., at 70).  At\nthis time, the deficiency debt remains unsatisfied.\nApplicant claims to have paid several of her listed creditors: specifically, her\ncreditor 1.a debt, an overdraft account with $1,066.00 still owing according to her most\nrecent credit report, (see exs. 2 and 3: R.T., at 42), her lease account with creditor 1.c\n(see ex. 3; R.T., at 44-48), her listed $970.00 phone bill with creditor 1.d covering an\naccount opened in 2002 (R.T., at 48-52), her overdraft account with creditor 1.e that she\nreportedly opened in June 2005, and her utility account with creditor 1.h/1.l. \nAfforded an opportunity to supplement the record, Applicant provided very limited\ndocumentary support of payment histories with these four contested accounts (e.g.,\npayment histories, bank correspondence, canceled checks, and/or deposit slips). Her\npost-hearing payment corroboration (see ex. A) covered only her utility debt with\ncreditor 1.h/1.l (accepted as a single account).  Without some documented payment of\nher other accounts (i.e., creditors 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e), her payment assurances lack\nimportant  corroboration. \n\n4\nAddressing the remaining four debts, Applicant admits to two of them: creditor\n1.b, reportedly opened in December 2004, and creditor 1.f, reportedly opened 2006.\nBut she offers no plan for resolving either of these debts (R.T., at 42-43, 52-56).  With\nrespect to the two remaining listed debts (i.e., creditor 1.g, reportedly opened in 2001,\nand creditor1.I, reportedly opened in 2003), she expresses no familiarity with these\ndebts, and for this reason denies any liability for them (R.T., at 54, 66).  These creditors\nare listed, though, in both of her credit reports and reflect collection debts of two\nunidentified former accounts in her name (see exs. 2 and 3).  Afforded an opportunity to\nprovide documented proof of her identification efforts with the credit reporting agencies\nand/or the creditors themselves, she provided no supplementary proofs.\nApplicant nets about $3,000.00 a month from her work (R.T., at 86-87).  Her\nmonthly expenses total $2,177.00, which leaves her with a net monthly remainder of\nabout $723.00 (R.T., at 90-91).  Applicant assures she is an honest person who has\nmade some bad financial choices, most of them unavoidable, in the past that are hurting\nher reputation (see ex. A).   She provides no budget or other road map, though, to show\nhow she can address any of her unresolved debts with the resources she currently has\navailable to her.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial,\ncommon-sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\n\n5\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common-sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an engineering analyst for a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts over a six-year period spanning 1999 and 2005.\nConsidered together, and without resolution, they raise  security significant concerns.  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to \u201cindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  See AG, \u00b6 18.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and her past failure to address most of\nthem warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\n\n6\nGuidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d and DC 19\u00a9), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her difficult financial circumstances\nas a struggling single parent and, in particular, an especially difficult stretch for her\nduring a lengthy period of unemployment in 2003-2004.  Since she returned to full time\nemployment in 2004, she has been able to demonstrate only minimal progress in\nresolving her delinquent debts. Several of the debts she disputes; some she claims to\nhave paid, and others she cannot identify.\n Despite an opportunity to supplement the record, she has been able to\ndocument just one creditor (creditor 1.h/1/l) that she has successfully addressed (in\nthis case, with payment).  She provides no documentation to corroborate her disputes,\npayments, and identity claims with respect to the remaining 11 debts covered in the\nSOR.   Afforded an opportunity to do so, Applicant has not provided any documented\nproofs of payments, dispute exchanges, or plans for addressing any of her still\nunresolved debts.  Nor has she sought financial counseling to explore other ways of\ndischarging her remaining debts. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for her debts are plausible and reasonable to a degree.\nThey certainly demonstrate financial strains in her household following her divorce, and\nlater during a period of unemployment.  Extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant\napplication of MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18 are sufficiently shown to\nwarrant some application of MC 20(b) of AG \u00b6 20.\nApplicant seriously disputes most of her listed debts: some for prior payment,\nand others for lack of familiarity. While claim documentation is lacking with respect to\nall but her utility debt (i.e., creditor 1.h/1.l), several of her disputed debts are very old\nand show no activity in the accounts since 2003.  For these accounts, regardless of\nwhether they reflect otherwise valid debts owing on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, they may\nno longer be enforceable under the State\u2019s applicable statute of limitations for written\ncontracts.  Debts that appear to be covered by the State\u2019s statute of limitations\ncomprise creditors 1.c (last reported activity in March 2001), creditor 1.d (last reported\nactivity in November 2002), creditor 1.g (last reported activity in May 2001), and\ncreditor 1.I (last reported activity in March 2003).\nThe state statute of limitations in Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written\ncontract is four years See 16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16.051\n(statute of limitations for contracts and claims not otherwise provided for) and\n16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts).  Applicant\u2019s listed debts with creditors 1.c,\n1.d, 1.q and 1.I all appear to covered by the State\u2019s statute of limitations, and are\ntreated, as such, as debts that are limitations barred.  \n\n7\nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by\nour Appeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.\nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.  They have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020,\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001). \nWeight, if any, to be assigned to potentially applicable statutes of limitations\nunder the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the circumstances\nsurrounding the existing debts, and must take account of the Applicant\u2019s entire history\nof demonstrated trust and responsibility.  Viewed in this whole person light, the\ncontrolling state statute of limitations for written contracts and debts are entitled to be\naccorded significant mitigation weight in evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk with\nrespect to these specifically covered debts. \n                                                        \nBased on Applicant\u2019s afforded reliance on her State\u2019s four-year statute of\nlimitation to avert enforcement risk with respect to her accorded limitation-barred debts,\nmitigation credit is available to Applicant  By virtue of the age and non-enforcement\nstatus of the debts, MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability to these\nspecific limitation-barred debts.  \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s remaining unresolved debts, mitigation credit is only\npartially available based on her proofs.  Without any documentation of her payment\nefforts and disputes concerning these debts, important corroboration is lacking.  And\nwhile the Appeal Board has never held the lack of corroboration to be dispositive when\nassessing debt disputes (see ISCR Case No. 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 2006)), it has\ncertainly considered it an important factor in evaluating the intrinsic reliability or weight\nof evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 01 -02677 (App. Bd. October 2002).  Not helpful\neither to Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts is her lack of any demonstrable steps to seek\nfinancial counseling.  Without more information to demonstrate she is addressing her\nlisted debts and making use of financial counseling, she cannot safely mitigate all of\nthe Government\u2019s financial concerns.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\n\n8\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18.  Although many of her debts were accumulated under\nextenuating circumstances, she has not been able to demonstrate any headway with\nmost of her debts even after she returned to work in 2004.  Documented efforts to\naddress her unresolved debts, endorsements, employment history, and other evidence\nof extenuating circumstances all could have had a bearing on Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nreliability and trustworthiness.  However, the record contains very little probative\nsupport of either ongoing extenuating conditions, or efforts to address her remaining\ndebts (excluding creditor 1.h/1.I).  Without more, it is difficult to draw convincing\nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in\nthe mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated debts, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to many of\nher covered debts.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b, and sub-paragraphs 1.e, 1.f, 1.j and 1.k of the\nSOR.  Applicant is entitled to favorable conclusions with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.c,\n1.d, 1.g through 1.I,  and 1.l.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.I:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.k:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.l:\n     FOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 19, \n2006. On November 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 13, 2007; answered it \non November 27, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on November 30, 2007. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on December 7, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 12, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2007, scheduling the hearing for \nMarch 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFebruary 12, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 5 was not admitted, for the \nreasons set out below. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until February 29, 2008 to enable him to submit \nadditional evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX C through F. AX D was unsigned, \nand Applicant was given additional time to obtain a signed copy. He submitted AX G \nand H (the signed version of AX D) on March 6, 2008, and they were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s responses to AX C through H are attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on February 22, 2008. The record closed on March 6, 2008. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nUnauthenticated Report of Investigation \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 5, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \ndeclined to waive it (Tr. 36-38). I did not admit GX 5.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.h, and 1.i, to allege the specific collection agencies to which the medical debts alleged \nhad been transferred. Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion to amend (Tr. \n27-28). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the delinquent debts alleged \nunder Guideline F, except the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. He denied the conduct alleged \nunder Guideline E. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old help desk technician employed by a federal contractor.  \nHe has worked for his current employer since October 2007. He worked for another \nfederal contractor from July 2006 to October 2007 (Tr. 54-55). He was married in \nDecember 1990. He has a 22-year-old stepdaughter and two daughters, ages 16, and \n15.  He received a security clearance in April 1991. \n \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debts around 2002 or 2003, when the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.s became delinquent. His financial \nproblems were exacerbated when both he and his wife were laid off. He was \nunemployed for about two years, ending with his employment in July 2006. His wife was \n\n \n3 \n \n \nlaid off from her job in late 2004 after working for eight years (GX 2 at 3; Tr. 96), and \nshe was unemployed for about two and a half years (Tr. 55). In response to DOHA \nfinancial interrogatories, he attributed his financial problems to the long periods of \nunemployment suffered by his wife and himself, college tuition for his stepdaughter, and \nthe cost of his stepdaughter\u2019s wedding (GX 2 at 6). He suffered an injury in June 2007 \nand had no medical insurance, resulting in the medical debt of $1,282 alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f.  \n \nIn a personal financial statement executed in October 2007, Applicant listed net \nmonthly income of $3,082, monthly expenses of $2,550, no debt payments, and a net \nremainder of $532 (GX 2 at 5). This personal financial statement did not include any \nincome earned by his spouse. \n \nOn November 27, 2007, the day Applicant answered the SOR, he enrolled in a \ncredit counseling service (Enclosure to Answer to SOR). The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.x are being managed through this service. The \ncredit counseling service will receive $443 each month, beginning in February 2008, \nwhich will be automatically deducted from Applicant\u2019s bank account (AX B).  His debt \npayment plan is designed to pay off the delinquent debts in about 39 months (Tr. 50). \n \n \nApplicant purchased a home with his mother-in-law and father-in-law in May \n2003. His in-laws obtained the mortgage, but Applicant and his spouse pay the \nmortgage, taxes, and upkeep on the house (Tr. 49).  His monthly mortgage payment is \n$350, plus taxes of about $1,595 per year. His payments on the home have been made \non time (AX H). \n \n \nWhen Applicant executed his security clearance application on November 19, \n2006, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 27b, asking if he had his wages garnished or had \nany property repossessed in the last seven years, and he disclosed a repossession in \nMay 2005, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not disclose that two vehicles were \nrepossessed.  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27c, asking if any tax liens were placed \nagainst his property in the last seven years. He did not disclose the state tax lien \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. The lien was imposed after Applicant moved from one state to \nanother in the same tax year and was liable for taxes in both states.  He trusted a friend \nto prepare his tax returns.  He testified he was unaware of the tax lien until he received \nthe Statement of Reasons (Tr. 76, 82).  \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28a, asking if he had been more than \n180 days delinquent on any debt in the last seven years, and question 28b, asking if he \nwas currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt.  He did not disclose the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h through 1.u. After giving several vague reasons for not \ndisclosing the debts, he admitted he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b to avoid \nthe hassle of obtaining the information about all his debts (Tr. 92-93). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCar Repossession \n$7,511 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B \n1.b \nCable Service \n$367 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B \n1.c \nMedical \n$81 \nUncertain, no \ndocumentation \nTr. 66 \n1.d \nMedical \n$199 \nUnpaid \nTr. 67 \n1.e \nMedical \n$75 \nUncertain, no \ndocumentation \nTr. 68 \n1.f \nMedical \n$1,282 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B \n1.g \nCell Phone \n$671 \nUnpaid \nTr. 69 \n1.h \nMedical \n$100 \nPaid \nAX A; Tr. 70 \n1.i \nMedical \n$75 \nPaid \nGX 4; AX A; Tr. 70 \n1.j \nUnknown \n$80 \nUncertain, no \ndocumentation \nTr. 70-71 \n1.k \nTrash Collection \n$51 \nUncertain, no \ndocumentation \nTr. 71 \n1.l \nTrash Collection \n$75 \nPaid \nGX 2, 3, and 4; AX A;  \nTr. 70 \n1.m \nCredit Card \n$855 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B; Tr. 72 \n1.n \nCredit Card \n$1,220 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B; Tr. 73-74 \n1.o \nUtilities \n$1,048 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B \n1.p \nState tax lien \n$481 \nPaid \nAX A; Tr. 70 \n1.q \nPayday loan \n$470 \nCredit Counseling \nAX B; Tr. 77 \n1.r \nCredit card \n$685 \nSame debt as l.n \nAX B; Tr. 23 \n1.s \nInsurance \n$793 \nUnpaid, disputed, \nno documentation \nTr. 78 \n1.t \nCar repossession \n$4,899 \nCar sold, balance \nunpaid \nTr. 79 \n1.u \nCar repossession \n$958 \nCar sold, balance \nunpaid \nTr. 80 \n1.v \nMedical \n$1,282 \nSame debt as 1.f \nTr. 23, 81 \n1.x1 \nCable Service \n$367 \nSame debt as 1.b \nTr. 23, 64, 81 \n1.y \nMedical \n$70 \nUncertain, may be \nsame debt as 1.c \nAX B \n1.z \nMedical \n$607 \nUnpaid,  \nAX B; Tr. 82 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n                                                          \n1 There is no paragraph 1.w in the SOR. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 25 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted all the debts except for \nthe state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ AG \u00b6 \n19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.@   \n \n \nThe same debts are alleged twice in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.x, 1.f and 1.v, and 1.n \nand 1.r. Applicant suspected the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.y were the same \ndebts, but he was uncertain and could provide no documentation. When the same \nconduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, \n1.v, and 1.x. in Applicant=s favor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e).  AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is not raised because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 19(g) is not raised because there is no evidence that the state tax lien was \nimposed for failure to file a return or for filing a fraudulent return.  The evidence shows \nonly that the taxes due were not paid. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because several of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are not yet resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not \nestablished because he has numerous delinquent debts. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to \nrecur\u201d) also is not established because Applicant is still financially overextendedand has \nnot resolved several of his delinquent debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nThe long periods of unemployment suffered by Applicant and his wife were \nconditions beyond his control. However, some of the debts alleged in the SOR were \ndelinquent before they became unemployed. For those debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, \n1.s), AG \u00b6 20(b) is inapplicable.  For the debts that became delinquent because of their \nunemployment, the evidence shows that Applicant returned to work in July 2006, but he \ndid not begin a systematic program for resolving his delinquent debts until November \n2007, after he received the SOR. Thus, I conclude the second prong, responsible \nconduct, is not established.  Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established.   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  It \nthe person has received counseling, as in this case, it must also be shown that there \nare clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s enrollment in a credit counseling program is a promising first step.  \nHowever, he receives only limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), because his program \nonly applies to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q.   \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant has paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.p, and he has \ninitiated a payment plan to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, \nand 1.q.  AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for these debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nsuggested that the insurance debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s was disputed, and he was \nuncertain about the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.y, but he offered no \nevidence of a legitimate basis for any disputes. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \nestablished. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his answer to question 27c on his security \nclearance application by deliberately failing to disclose a state tax lien. It also alleges he \nfalsified his answer to questions 28a and 28b by deliberately failing to disclose his \ndelinquent debts. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. \n02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose that two vehicles were repossessed in May 2005 is \nnot alleged in the SOR.  Both vehicles apparently were repossessed at the same time.  I \nam satisfied he did not intentionally omit relevant and material information in response \nto question 27b. Likewise, I found his explanation for not disclosing the state tax lien in \nresponse to question 27c plausible and credible. However, I find that he intentionally \nomitted his delinquent debts in response to questions 28a and 28b, because he \nadmitted he omitted them to avoid the hassle of obtaining and providing the information \nabout them. Thus, I conclude the disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). There is no evidence of any effort by Applicant to correct the \nrecord before he was confronted with the evidence of his delinquent debts.  I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigating by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c).  \nApplicant\u2019s intentional omission of relevant and material information from his SF 86 was \nnot a minor dereliction. It was a felony, violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. It was recent, \ninvolving his current application for a clearance. It did not occur under \u201cunique \ncircumstances,\u201d but rather as part of a routine security clearance application.  Although \nit is the only instance of its kind in his record, it raises doubt about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. No other \nenumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \n\n \n10 \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under Guidelines F and E above, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, gainfully employed and devoted to his job and his \nfamily. Now that his stepdaughter has graduated from college and married, his financial \nobligations are lessened. He has taken significant steps to resolve his debts, but many \nof them are still unresolved. His lack of candor on his security clearance application \nraises serious questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 28, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant had thirteen delinquent debts.  He had made no payments on his mortgage or delinquent debts since\n1\nthe last payment to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan in January or February 2008.  He hoped to file for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, but had not done so at the time of the hearing.  Decision at 3.  Applicant requested at the hearing that the\nJudge delay adjudication pending resolution of the bankruptcy matter, which Applicant acknowledged might take months.\nThe Judge denied Applicant\u2019s motion.  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s decision to deny his motion.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s ruling was outside the scope of his discretion.  Compare ISCR Case No.\n06-24458 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008).\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which established that his financial\nproblems were the result of circumstances beyond his control and that he is in the process of\nresolving those problems.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had a significant number\nof outstanding debts, and was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light\n1\nof the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why\nthe mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board\ndoes not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 19, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on July 16, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 17, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on August 14, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through O, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about April 2006. He served in the U.S. Army on active duty \nfrom 1991 to 1998. He received numerous awards and citations while serving in the \nArmy and was honorably discharged. Applicant has had many health issues since he \nwas discharged which were related to his military service. He is rated at 60% disabled \nand receives about $1,100 per month for his disability. Applicant has a Bachelor of \nScience degree. He is divorced. He reconciled with his ex-wife after the divorce. They \nlive together but have not remarried. They have three children, ages 14, 8, and 18 \nmonths.1  \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 1997. Schedule D, Creditors \nHolding Secured Claims listed two debts totaling $9,163. Schedule F, Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Nonpriority Claims listed 15 debts totaling about $12,919. The bankruptcy \nwas dismissed for default in plan payments on November 9, 2000.2  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties that led to his bankruptcy in 1997 to \nbeing \u201c[y]oung and dumb.\u201d He was stationed overseas and he and his wife ran up large \ntelephone bills communicating with each other. The 1997 bankruptcy petition also lists \nsix accounts for checks returned for nonsufficient funds plus service charges.3 \n \n \nApplicant worked for the same company from 2001 through 2006, and his \nfinances stabilized. He accepted his current job in April 2006. He makes less money at \nthis job and has not received the overtime that he expected would make up the shortfall. \nWhen he realized this, he attempted to get his old job back but the company had \nalready filled the position. His ex-wife also became pregnant about this time. He re-\nfinanced the mortgage on his house in 2006.4 He indicated that he did not receive what \nhe thought he was bargaining for: \n \nIn 2006 I also re-financed our home. I was told that our pool would be paid \nfor, our automobiles were to be paid off, as well as our credit cards, and \nwe were to get $5,000 cash. Our payment was to go up less than $300.00 \nper month in return. After I signed the papers, we only had the pool and \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 12, 20-27, 38; GE 1; AE D-O. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4. \n \n3 Tr. at 35-36; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 27-30, 32-35; GE 1; AE F. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ncredit cards paid for, and we still had the almost $900.00 per month in \nautomobile payments going out.5 \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy again on November 6, 2007. The plan \ncalled for Applicant to pay the $9,871 in arrears on his mortgage; $17,137 on the \nsecured claims for his two cars; and $8,292 on his unsecured debts. He was to pay \n$700 per month for 60 months and also contribute his 2007 and 2008 tax refunds. He \nmade about three or four payments on the plan and then stopped paying in about \nJanuary or February 2008.6 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 13 delinquent debts. With the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.h, Applicant \neither admitted to owing the debts or admitted the debts were part of his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. The medical debts in the SOR are unrelated to Applicant\u2019s claims against \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant\u2019s mortgage \nwas past due in the amount of $211,000 as of April 22, 2008. The credit report of April \n22, 2008, does not state that he was past due $211,000. It states that he owed \n$211,000 and $15,505 was past due. He testified that he is about seven or eight months \nbehind on his mortgage. Similarly, SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant\u2019s auto loan was past \ndue in the amount of $13,113. The credit report of April 22, 2008 states he owed \n$13,113 on the loan and it was past due in the amount of $4,381.7  \n \n \nThe transmission in Applicant\u2019s car broke earlier in this year. He testified that it \nwould have cost $3,000 or $4,000 to fix the transmission. Instead he used his income \ntax refund as a down payment to buy another car. He would like to convert the Chapter \n13 bankruptcy into a Chapter 7. He is not able to do that at this time.8 As stated by his \nbankruptcy attorney: \n \nBecause the chapter 7 trustee would be entitled to your tax refund if we \nconverted your case from chapter 13 to 7, we will not be able to convert \nyour case to a chapter 7 unless you are able to pay to the chapter 7 \ntrustee, in a short period of time, an amount that equaled your tax refund. \nIf not, you should allow your chapter 13 to be dismissed and file a chapter \n7 later.9 \n \n \nApplicant hopes to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy but has not yet done so. He has \nmade no payments on his mortgage or delinquent debts since the last payment to the \nChapter 13 plan. He has received financial counseling pursuant to his bankruptcy. He is \n                                                          \n5 AE F. \n \n6 Tr. at 14, 30-32, 36; GE 1; AE F, G. \n \n7 Tr. at 32-33, 36-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F, G. \n \n8 Tr. at 14, 30-31, 46-47; GE 1; AE F, G. \n \n9 AE C. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nlooking into a side business of building wooden furniture, which could give him \nadditional income and options.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 29-30, 37, 39, 44-45; AE A, B. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nHe attributed the financial difficulties that led to his bankruptcy in 1997, to being \u201c[y]oung \nand dumb.\u201d His finances stabilized for a period and then worsened when he accepted a \njob for less pay, refinanced his house, and his ex-wife became pregnant. Those were \nnot conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nused his income tax refund as a down payment on a car. He has not paid his mortgage \nin many months and has made no payments outside the bankruptcy plan. I am unable \nto find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling but his financial problems are not \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. The three or four \npayments to the bankruptcy plan are insufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. He may file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the future, but his debts \ncurrently remain unresolved. He has not disputed any of the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (e) \nare not applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to \nour country in the U.S. Army and that he is a disabled veteran. However, his finances \nare in terrible shape. They remain a security concern  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

On September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 26, 2007; answered \nthe SOR on September 27, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on September 28, 2007. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on October 16, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on \nOctober 22, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 8, 2007, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 29, 2007. Government Exhibits (GX) \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection.

I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to enable him to \nsubmit additional matters.  Applicant timely submitted AX G, and it was admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX G is attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit I.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 6, 2007. The \nrecord closed on December 14, 2007.  Based upon my review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted eight of the 20 delinquent debts \nalleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.r, and 1.s).

His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor.  He \nhas worked for his current employer since September 2006.  He served on active duty \nin the U.S. Army from December 1980 to May 1992.  He received a security clearance \nin January 1981, while he was on active duty in the Army.  He has not held a clearance \nsince he left the Army (Tr. 11). \n \n \nApplicant was separated from the Army with a disability, and he receives \ndisability pay of $225 per month.  He attended college from January 1993 to August \n1998 under a vocational rehabilitation program and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree.  \nWhen he was unsuccessful in obtaining a job paying more than the minimum wage, he \nreturned to school and obtained a master\u2019s degree in May 2003.  After obtaining his \nmaster\u2019s degree, he sent out about 3,000 resumes, including more than 800 with the \nDepartment of the Army (AX D), but could not find employment offering more than \nminimum pay.  He is currently in a doctoral program and expects to obtain his PhD \nwithin two years (Tr. 72).  He has over $100,000 in student loans (Tr. 72). \n \n \nSince his military service, Applicant has held numerous low-paying jobs, \nincluding working as a security guard, night auditor at several hotels, night stocker at a \nhome improvement store, hotel desk clerk, customer service representative, and \ncomputer technician.  For two periods, from November 1999 to September 1999, and \nfrom May 2000 to February 2002, he was working two jobs.  He testified his take-home \npay during this period was about $800 per month, of which $600 was used for rent and \nutilities (Tr. 64-65).  He was unemployed in November and December 2005.  His current \njob is his first that pays more than $20 per hour. \n \nDuring his periods of underemployment, Applicant incurred numerous delinquent \ndebts, including those alleged in the SOR.  Some of his debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.m, and \n1.q) date back to the year 2000.   In the spring of 2007, Applicant hired a law firm to \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndispute some of the debts listed on his credit reports (GX 2 at 15-30). The law firm \nadvised him not to initiate any direct contact with his creditors.  He has terminated his \nrelationship with the law firm because he was not satisfied with its progress (Tr. 58-59). \n \n \nIn August 2007, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a \npersonal financial statement reflecting monthly net income of $3,400, expenses of \n$2,200, debt payments of $240, and a net remainder of $960 (GX 2 at 2).  He testified \nhis net remainder is now a little higher because he recently received a raise (Tr. 62).  \nHe is unmarried and not responsible for supporting anyone but himself.  However, he \nassists his sister from time to time (Tr. 68-69). \n \nIn November 2007, about three weeks before the hearing, Applicant enrolled in a \ndebt management program with a credit counseling service.  He is required to deposit \nabout $247 per month with the service, which will make monthly payments to the \ncreditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.n (AX E at 1-2).  His \nfirst payment was due on December 12, 2007 (Tr. 43). \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a, 1.b, and I.i, \nbut his debt management program provides for payments on these debts  He disputed \nthe payday loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o, because it was incurred when the lender repeatedly \nprocessed a check until it cleared (Tr. 53-54).

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out \nin AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his admitted inability to pay them are sufficient \nto raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e).  No other enumerated disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline are raised by the evidence. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), a disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This is a compound mitigating \ncondition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d or \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and frequent.  Many of them are not \ncovered by his debt management plan and remain unresolved.  Thus, neither of the first \ntwo prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cso infrequent\u201d) is established.  With respect to the third \nprong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d), it is too soon to tell whether he will adhere to his debt \nmanagement plan and incorporate the remaining delinquent debts into the plan.  \nLurking over the horizon is his educational debt of more than $100,000.  I conclude the \nthird prong also is not established.  Thus, Applicant has failed to carry his burden of \nestablishing AG \u00b6 20(a).   \n \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated \nwhere Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@  Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and \nresponsible conduct, must be established.  Applicant\u2019s long period of underemployment \nwas beyond his control.  He reacted responsibly by working two jobs at a time and \nattempting to improve his credentials.  He appears to have been living modestly during \nhis underemployment.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 20(c), security concerns may be mitigated by evidence that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@  Applicant\u2019s credit \ncounseling agency has addressed his debt problem, and some of his debts will be \nunder control if he adheres to the payment plan.  However, many of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR are not included in his plan.  Furthermore, it is too soon to tell whether he will \nadhere to the payment plan.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \n \nThe mitigating condition in AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that \nshows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Security \nconcerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated by payment of debts only \nunder pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant began his current employment in September 2006.  He hired a law firm \nto assist him sometime during the spring of 2007, but he hired the firm to dispute items \non his credit report, not to negotiate and settle legitimate debts. He responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories about his finances in August 2007, but it was not until three weeks \nbefore the hearing that he engaged a credit counseling agency to negotiate payments \non his delinquent debts.  Although four debts alleged in the SOR were under $100, he \ndid not use his $960 net monthly remainder to resolve any of them.  His inaction was \nunderstandable after the law firm cautioned him against contacting the creditors, but it \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndoes not explain his inaction between September 2006 and the spring of 2007.  He now \nhas a payment plan for nine of the debts alleged in the SOR, and he has a payment \nplan for the federal tax lien.  However ten debts, including three for less than $100, \nremain unresolved.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult.  His long period of underemployment \nmay have some significance with respect to his job-hunting skills, but not his financial \nresponsibility.  However, his failure to address his financial problems promptly after he \nbegan his current position raises doubts about his prudence and sense of obligation.  \nHe has belatedly taken a step in the right direction by engaging a credit counseling \nagency, and he has been making regular payments on the federal tax lien.  However, \nmany debts are not included in his debt management plan, and he has not yet \nestablished a track record of compliance with his plan.  If Applicant can incorporate all \nhis delinquent debts into his debt management plan or otherwise resolve them, and if he \nestablishes a track record of compliance with his plan, he may be able to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns based on his financial history, but it is too soon to make that \ndetermination.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.3.37-E3.1.40 (reconsideration authorized after one \nyear). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.t \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 26, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nMay 14, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer was received on December 26, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2008. The hearing took place\nas scheduled on April 16, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 23, 2008.\nThe record was kept open until April 30, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted post-hearing matters,\nwhich were forwarded by department counsel without objections. The post-hearing\nmatters are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit E\u2013cover letter; (2) Exhibit F\u2013student loan\ndocuments; (3) Exhibit G\u2013satisfaction of judgment documents; (4) Exhibit H\u2013university\ntranscript; and (5) Exhibit I\u2013university program of study. \nProcedural Rulings\nWithout objections, Applicant\u2019s Answer was amended to correct a transposition\nerror (Tr. 23\u201324). His response to SOR \u00b6 1.c is amended to address SOR \u00b6 1.d.\nLikewise, his response to SOR \u00b6 1.d is amended to address SOR \u00b6 1.c \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems as follows: (1)\nfour unpaid delinquent debts; (2) a judgment obtained in 2006 for $7,410; and (3) six\nstudent loans referred for collection. His Answer was mixed. He denied the two debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and he admitted the remaining allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c\u20131.k. Also, he provided an explanation for the debts as well as his overall financial\nsituation. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established\nby substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nthis company as a cost analyst since February 2005. He is seeking to obtain an\nindustrial security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant has never married and has no children. He attended college during\n1995-2000 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. His student loans\nstem from this period. Since college, his employment history has been varied, to include\ntraditional accounting jobs, self-employment as a cable TV installer, and working in a\ncabinet shop. The result was, at times, an inability to meet his financial obligations. \n\n3\nApplicant decided to return to a desk job in 2005 when he accepted his current\njob as a cost analyst. He enjoys his work and plans on continuing to work for his current\nemployer. To that end, his company is paying for him to obtain a degree in electrical\nengineering because he will be a more valuable employee with engineering and\ntechnical skills (Tr. 42; Exhibits H and I). \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 2, 3, and\n4). The matters alleged in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the\nadmitted documentary evidence. Except for the student loans, Applicant has paid or\nsettled the debts, and he provided documentary evidence as proof-of-payment. He\ndefaulted on the student loans and the loans went into collection. Since about early\n2007, he has made regular monthly payments, via a garnishment, on the student loans.\nThe debts, as alleged in the SOR, are summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$166 collection account. \nPaid $166 in Feb. 2008 (Exhibit D).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$294 collection account. \nPaid $294 in Feb. 2008 (Exhibit C).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$1,842 charged-off account\nfor a credit card bill. \nSettled for $3,400 in Dec. 2007 (Exhibit\nA, Attachment 2). \nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$7,441 collection account for\na credit card bill. \nSame debt as SOR \u00b6 1.k.   \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e\u20131j\u2013six student loans for\nvarious amounts referred for collection in\nabout 2003. \nMaking regular monthly payments since\nearly 2007; balance of $16,860 as of Apr.\n2008 (Exhibit A, Attachment 3; Exhibit F).\nSOR \u00b6 1.k\u2013$7,410 judgment obtained in\nDec. 2006. \nSettled for $6,320 in Oct. 2007 (Exhibit A,\nAttachment 1; Exhibit B; Exhibit G).  \nIn addition to the payments, Applicant has taken other steps to improve his\noverall financial condition. He has not had a rent payment since about July 2006 when\nhe moved into his parents\u2019 home. He is taking care of their house as his parents are\nworking in Iraq. He expects that situation to continue for another 12 to 18 months and\nhe will likely move out at that time. Also in 2006, he sold his truck thereby eliminating a\nlarge monthly loan payment. He used the sale proceeds to buy a used car for cash. \nApplicant is now able to meet his expenses and debt payments. He recently\nopened a secured credit card account to improve his credit history. He contributes to a\n401(k) retirement account and has a balance of about $11,000. He has about $1,300 in\nthe bank between checking and savings accounts. In the next 60 days or so, he expects\nto receive about $9,500 before taxes from a sale of stock associated with the purchase\nof his company. \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n18\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The delinquent debts and the student loans in\ncollection are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.\n18\nThe most pertinent is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve the debts. Applicant has done much to\ndemonstrate an intent to clean up his financial house. As summarized in the table\nabove, he has paid or settled four debts for a total of about $10,180. He has made\nregular monthly payments, albeit by a garnishment, on the student loans since early\n\n6\n2007, and he has made progress in reducing the balance. Also, he has taken other\nsteps to reduce his expenses. Taken together, these circumstances are substantial\nevidence of a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, Applicant struggled financially after\ngraduating from college and entering the workforce. His irregular employment affected\nhis ability to pay his debts. He has had steady employment in his current job since\n2005, and he intends to continue working for this company. His overall financial\ncondition has improved, he is now exercising more financial responsibility, and it is\nunlikely that he will experience similar financial problems in the future. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 16,\n2006. On November 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on December 12, 2007. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 8, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 29, 2008. At the\nhearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified. In the time allowed for Applicant to\nsubmit additional documentation, he submitted AE A and AE B. AE A is an incomplete\nportion of his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition. AE B is a two-page ledger statement\nJuly 24, 2008\n\n Applicant provided no documentation showing the unemployment office responsible for the training. \n1\n2\nregarding payments on his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) lien for tax years 1996 and\n1997, and verification of a zero balance as of June 9, 2008. (AE B) DOHA received a\ncopy of the transcript of the proceedings on June 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists 21 debts under the financial considerations guideline. The second\nguideline (paragraph 2, personal conduct) lists two allegations. Applicant admitted all\nfinancial allegations except the IRS lien owed the federal government. He denied both\nallegations under paragraph 2. He thought the question in 2.a. of the SOR applied only\nto current debts. In defense of his \u201cNo\u201d answer to the 2.b. allegation, he did not have a\ncredit report when he answered the question. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has been employed as a security officer since\nAugust 2006. He seeks a security clearance.\nFinancial Considerations\nIn 1978, Applicant began working as a materials packer of trucks. In 1983, he\nseriously injured his back. He could no longer pick up heavy items. The injury led to a\nmajor deterioration of the discs in his back that he first discovered in 1993. The disc\nproblem has limited the types of work he can perform. \nBetween 1993 and 1997, Applicant believed he was handling his finances suitably\nbecause he was earning about $45,000.00 a year, and was building a house. Suddenly,\nhis back flared up and marital problems surfaced due to his wife\u2019s worsening emotional\nproblems. He incurred federal tax problems for tax year 1997 (SOR 1.u.) after his wife\nfiled federal tax returns and kept the tax refund. In early 1998, their relationship became\nso intolerable that he left her to live with his mother for a while in another part of the\nMidwestern United States. \nWhile living with his mother or in the same locale between 1998 and 2003,\nApplicant claims that an unemployment office official promised to finance his training to\nbecome a truck driver. (SOR 1.q, $3,000.00)  Applicant successfully completed the\n1\ncourse and tried to drive for several transport companies. Unfortunately, his back and/or\nhis nerves prevented him from keeping the jobs for very long. \nIn 2003, Applicant settled in the area and began working for a national discount\nstore. A hurricane hit the area in September 2005, and forced Applicant, his girlfriend at\nthe time, and her disabled son, into a federal trailer for several months. \n\n He stated he had his medical bills at home. He also was paying on these medical bills. No documentation\n2\nwas produced. \n By combining her Social Security with his earnings, they should have a larger monthly remainder available\n3\nto pay the past due debts than is reflected in GE 4. \n AE B does not reveal what the amount of the original lien was and when the lien was filed. An amount of\n4\n$1,600.00 is determined to be the original amount of the lien based on subtracting the withholding amount\n($6,200.00) from the additional amount assessed ($7,800.00) that appears on the first page of AE B. \n3\nIn August 2006, Applicant began working for his current employer, but had to take\nmedical leave for various health problems. The back problems continued, and dental\npain/infection caused him to take a week off in October 2007 to have several teeth\nremoved. Then, he had to take two weeks off to obtain a diagnosis and proper treatment\nfor his eyes. Next, he discovered growths under his arms that had to be removed. Then,\nafter discovering he had diabetes, he found out his body could only tolerate certain kinds\nof medication. After taking off work for another six weeks for surgical removal of\ngallstones, he started back to work in March 2008.  Applicant receives most of his\n2\ntreatment from the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital (VA) at the present time. \nApplicant has grossed approximately $11,000.00 since March 2008, even though\nhis current earnings fluctuate. After subtracting his expenses from earnings, he has a net\nremainder of $100.00 to $200.00 a month. He allows his fianc\u00e9 of 18 months to handle\nthe finances. Applicant\u2019s participation in handling the finances entails turning over his\ncheck to his fianc\u00e9, and she pools  his check with the $1,100 she receives monthly in\n3\nSocial Security to pay the bills and medical accounts. She is concentrating on his\nmedical bills from 2007 and early 2008. His fianc\u00e9 did not assist him when he completed\nthe SCA in October 2006.\nThe number of past due accounts listed in the SOR decreases by one with\nApplicant\u2019s payoff of the IRS tax lien in June 2008. (AE B)  After subtracting $1,600.00\n4\nfrom 10,188.00, he still owes 20 creditors approximately $8588.00.\nPersonal Conduct\nOn October 16, 2006, Applicant filled out, certified, and signed a security\nclearance application (SCA). Based on entries in GE 2 and GE 3, he falsified question\n28.a. (SOR 2.a. of his SCA by answering \u201cNo\u201d to having debts over 180 days delinquent\nin the last 7 years), and by answering \u201cNo\u201d to question 28.b. (over 90 days delinquent on\nany debt). He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 27.d. (SOR 2.b., judgments in the last 7\nyears). Though he denied falsifying either question in his answer to the SOR, he testified\nthat he knew he had debts over 180 days delinquent when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question\n28.a. in October 2006. (Tr. 79) Regarding his negative response to question 27.d., I find\nhe intentionally falsified his answer on the security form in October 2006 because he\nacknowledged the judgment in GE 4 and in his answers to the SOR. \n\n4\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant served honorably in the Unites States Marine Corps (USMC) from 1973\nto 1976. On April 16, 2008, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and furnished the\nSchedule F list of his unsecured creditors. However, he did not provide a complete copy\nof the petition nor did he provide evidence of filing the petition. He also received a half\nday of required financial counseling in advance of filing his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\npetition. Applicant likes his job because he does not have to put weight on his back. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 believes she and Applicant communicate well. She has found\nApplicant to be honest, and someone she would trust with her life. Even though she is\npaying on the current medical debt, she also tries to save about $50.00 a month. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\n\n5\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nA person who does not live within their means is at risk of engaging in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nDeliberately concealing information during the course of a security investigation\ndemonstrates dishonesty while representing a serious security concern.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nOn November 7, 2007 (date of the SOR), Applicant owed 20 creditors $8588.00.\nHe also owed IRS for a tax lien he incurred in 1996 and 1997. (SOR 1.u.) Having\ndetermined from AE B that the federal tax to be at least $1,500.00, Applicant\u2019s total past\ndue indebtedness was about $10,000.00. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply because the debts still exist, and they have fallen delinquent at various\ntimes between 1997 (SOR 1.u, federal tax debt) and 2006. I have decided not to include\nFC DC 19.g. (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required\nor fraudulent filing of the same). There is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude\nApplicant tried to defraud the government. Rather, Applicant was experiencing\nrelationship problems with his wife at the time that he could only rectify by leaving her,\nand obtaining a divorce. \nThe mitigating conditions have been evaluated. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a.\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n\n6\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply as Applicant still\nowes for all the overdue accounts except SOR 1.u. The number, amount of the debt, and\nage of some of the listed accounts, continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current\nreliability, and judgment. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control). Since 1993,\nApplicant\u2019s back problems prevented him from performing jobs requiring use of his back.\nHis medical problems were exacerbated by an array of other serious health problems\nthat kept him from work, and required hospitalization for varying periods of time until\nMarch 2008. However, since March 2008, he has grossed about $11,00.00. He could\nhave applied some of his income to resolve smaller debt listed in the SOR. Alternatively,\nhe could have submitted some documentation supporting his claims he was paying on\nthe current medical debts. Without documentation that supports his claims of paying on\nthese current medical debts, it is difficult to conclude he acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances after he returned to work in March 2008. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control)\nreceives limited favorable attention due to the fact he did not receive counseling until\nrequired to by filing his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition. Though the bankruptcy discharge\nin June 2008 may extinguish Applicant\u2019s immediate debts, there is insufficient evidence\nto show Applicant has the financial tools to manage an encounter with similar financial\nproblems in the future.\nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While he paid off the IRS in June 2008 (10\nyears after incurring the debt in 1997), Applicant still owes 20 creditors $8,588.00.\nThough a Chapter 7 discharge is a lawful way of extinguishing one\u2019s debts when he\ncannot repay them, a discharge in this fashion does not receive the same level of\nmitigation because there is no sustained record of repaying debts. Rather, the debtor\nhas his debts eliminated, and is given a fresh start while the creditor is left without legal\nrecourse to recover the balance of a debt. The mitigation Applicant receives under FC\nMC 20.b., FC MC 20.c., and FC MC 20.d. does not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion under the FC guideline. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to both debt questions (28.a., 28.b.) of his SCA in\nOctober 2006 were deliberate falsifications of relevant facts as defined by PC DC 16.a.\n(deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness)\nApplicant knew that he was concealing information when he entered his \u201cNo\u201d answers on\nthe form. \nI have carefully considered the following mitigating conditions to determine\nwhether Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions are mitigated: PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) \nPC MC 17. a. does not apply because Applicant did not disclose the falsification\nuntil after he was confronted at the hearing about his \u201cNo\u201d answers to both questions on\nthe security form. PC MC 17.b. (the offense was so minor, or such time passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) does not apply as Applicant attempted to conceal 20 debts less than two\nyears ago. Finally, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) applies in part as\nApplicant admitted he deliberately omitted his debts from the form. However, he has not\npresented enough mitigating evidence to confidently conclude his dishonesty is unlikely\nto recur. In sum, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation falls short of overcoming the adverse\nevidence under the PC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have weighed the circumstances of this case under the general factors of the\nwhole person concept. Applicant was between 43 and 53 years old when he\naccumulated his overdue debt. Though he has taken a step in the right direction with a\nChapter 7 discharge, there is a substantial lack of evidence indicating what his financial\npractices are except that when he gets his check, he turns it over to his fianc\u00e9. Also, he\nwas advised that his claims of paying off certain medical creditors would be more\ncredible if he supplied documentation. Considering the evidence as a whole, the\nabsence of documentation showing that more than one out of 20 creditors has been\ncompletely or partially satisfied militates against Applicant\u2019s security clearance suitability.\nSOR 2.a. is also resolved against Applicant. While he denied and/or could not remember\n\n8\nthe judgment (SOR 1.a.) at the hearing, he admitted the debt in his answer to the SOR,\nand he acknowledged the debt in his answers to interrogatories September 2007. (GE 4)\nAccordingly, the FC and PC guidelines are found against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 17, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\n\n2\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be\ndecided on the written record.  On May 20, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nMary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had deliberately falsified\nhis security clearance application; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under\nGuidelines D, E and J is sustainable.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge erred with respect to several of his findings about the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\ndisqualifying conduct.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application\nby failing to disclose that he had been asked to resign from his employment in 2004 in lieu of being\nterminated.  In support of this contention, he argues that he misread the question at issue because he\nwas \u201c. . . being rushed to get the form turned in.\u201d  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\nerred.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about the omission and evaluate his credibility\nin the context of a hearing.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge considered\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was\nnot bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered\nApplicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a\nsufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate and intentional.  Given the limited\nrecord that was before her, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.\n\n3\n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence as to positive changes\nin his life since the occurrence of the disqualifying conduct.  This argument does not establish the\nJudge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant with\nrespect to some of the SOR\u2019s factual allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

He rejected her\nrequest for additional sexual activity, but at her request, masturbated in the parking lot\nfor her. In 2002, while in his vehicle in a non-populated location of a public parking area,\nApplicant and his wife engaged in sexually stimulating conduct with each other. No one\nobserved them. Applicant voluntarily acknowledged these three incidents.5\nApplicant started work with the National Security Agency (NSA) in a temporary\nposition in October 2002. On the morning of June 14, 2004, Applicant engaged in a\ntelephone conversation with a woman with whom he had developed a friendly\nrelationship over the internet. The content of the conversation became sexual and he\nbegan to masturbate in his car. He had parked his car in the NSA employee parking lot.\nA woman observed him and told NSA security, who investigated. NSA security officers\nalso observed Applicant\u2019s conduct. They informed him that his conduct violated state\nlaw, but did not arrest him. The next day, June 15, 2004, he spoke with a NSA security\ninvestigator. He told the investigator that he was speaking with his wife on the telephone\nwhile in his car. He signed a written and sworn statement to this effect on the same\nday.6\nThe next day, June 16, 2004, Applicant contacted the investigator and advised\nthat he had not been truthful the day before and admitted that he was talking on the\ntelephone with a woman other than his wife. On this day, he signed a sworn statement\nacknowledging that he intentionally and deliberately falsified the statement given the\nprevious day.  NSA required him to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist\nrendered an opinion, which is not of record.7\nOn August 30, 2004, Applicant met with NSA Human Resources staff. He\nresigned his position after being offered a choice of resigning or being fired. He believed\nthat if he resigned, his security clearance remained in effect, but has since learned his\nbelief was incorrect. Three months later, in November 2004, another contractor\nsponsored Applicant for a NSA Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance.\nNSA issued a clearance decision, dated  January 15, 2005, denying Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a SCI security clearance because of the above sexual conduct and his falsification.\nRelying on this decision, the Defense Security Service denied him a security clearance\non March 2, 2006.8\nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SF 86) on March 17\n2006. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the following question:\n\nItem 2, supra note 1, at 3; Item 3, supra note 1, at 12-17, 23-24, 27-27.\n9\n4\nSection 22: Your Employment Record\nAnswer the following question.\nHas any of the following happened to you in the last seven years?\n1.\nFired from a job.\n2.\nQuit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.\n3.\nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of\nmisconduct.\n4.\nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of\nunsatisfactory performance.\n5.\nLeft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.\nYes: (   )   No: (    )\nAlthough Applicant left NSA 18 months earlier after being asked to resign, he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to this question. In his response, he denies deliberately falsifying his\nanswers.  He states that he did not read the question carefully. Rather, because he was\nbeing pressured by his office to hurry, he read part one and then answered the\nquestion. In completing his questionnaire, Applicant provided detailed answers to other\nquestions, particularly those questions related to his finances.9\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following conduct will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(f), and16(g) are not raised in this case.\n10\n6\nApplicant provided false information to the NSA investigators on June 15, 2004\nwhen questioned about his conduct in the parking lot on June 14, 2004. Unless he has\nmitigated this conduct, his clearance would be denied.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing conditions may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information, and\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing.10\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 22 about his employment record. This information\nis material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance\nand to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate.\nHe denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to this question. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n11\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n7\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n11\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant knew that he had been asked to resign from his NSA job and that he\nresigned under pressure. His statement that he did not read the question fully is not\ncredible because the question format forces him to review all the criteria he should\nconsider when answering the question. In addition, Applicant, as an engineer, is a\nperson who is trained in detail work as shown by the detailed answers to other\nquestions. His answers to other questions indicate he took his time to make sure he\nprovided the information requested. The government has established its case as to\nallegation 1.g.\nConcerning his sexual conduct, the record shows a pattern of conduct in public\nplaces. While Applicant has not been arrested for his conduct and states he is discreet,\nhis decision to perform sexual acts in public places raises concerns about his judgment,\nlack of candor, and unwillingness to follow the public rules on such conduct. Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and his failure to be forthright about it makes him vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure or coercion. DC \u00b6\u00b6 16 (d)(1), (d)(3), and (e)(1) apply.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 which provides that\nthe following conditions could mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n8\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant voluntarily reported his false statement to the NSA investigator one day\nlater. By so doing, he made a good faith effort to report his conduct prior to being\nconfronted with the information. He has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his\nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. However, none of the remaining SOR\nallegations and related security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under this guideline as:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and,\n\n9\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nAppellant acknowledges that years ago he paid for prostitutes while overseas.\nHe also acknowledges several incidents of masturbating in public, sexual conduct which\nshows a lack of judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13 (a), (c), and (d) apply.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in 1990 and 1991 while serving in the Navy overseas\noccurred many years ago and has not occurred since. Thus, AG \u00b6 14 (b) applies to\nallegation 2.b of the SOR. Concerning Applicant\u2019s more recent masturbation conduct,\nhe has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns. His actions reflect a pattern of public\nconduct over a period of time. His decisions to satisfy his sexual needs in public places\nreflect poor judgment and can serve as a basis for coercion or exploitation. He has not\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline D.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following disqualifying condition could raise a security\nconcern in this case:\nc) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant lied on his SF-86, which is a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1001. Thus, the\ngovernment has established its case under this guideline. I have considered the\n\n10\napplicable mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and conclude that none of them apply.\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct problems\nfirst began when he was a young man in the Navy. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) Although he no\nlonger solicits prostitutes, he continues to occasionally satisfy his sexual desires in\npublic places, which shows a serious lack of judgment. He has presented no evidence\nthat he has changed his behavior, that he understands the negative implications of this\nconduct. As he ages, he has shown no improvement in his judgment about his conduct.\nIn addition, he deliberately failed to acknowledge that NSA asked him to resign his\nposition or be fired. Applicant\u2019s recent decisions indicate very poor judgment. These\ndecisions have a potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress and could\noccur again. His conduct raises significant security concerns\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 6, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 19, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline F Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) is erroneous because it is\nunsupported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is contrary to\nand unsupported by the record evidence.\n            Whether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts:\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is married, but currently\nseparated.  She has a child from a former relationship and a child from her marriage.  From 1996\nuntil 2002, Applicant was an airport screener for a security company.  Since that time, Applicant has\nworked for other security firms; and since August 2004, she has worked for a federal contractor as\na security officer.  Applicant was unemployed for three to four months in 2002 and 1\u00bd months in\n2003.  In 2007, Applicant was out of work for six weeks after her child was born.  During those\nperiods, Applicant received unemployment compensation of about $200 every two weeks.  \nIn 2001, Applicant received seven credit cards, which she used for holiday presents and some\nexpenses.  At first, Applicant was able to manage the credit card bills.  However, her unemployment\nand a significantly lower salary at her next job caused financial difficulties.  Applicant admitted that\nfrom 2003 to 2006 she lived beyond her means.  She tried to obtain a loan to pay off her debts, but\nwas unable to do so because her credit rating was poor.  \nApplicant responded to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories regarding 26 debts in October 2007, stating\nthat she could not afford to pay them at that time, but would try to resolve them soon.  On February\n29, 2008, Applicant contacted a credit-counseling firm for assistance in paying off her debts, and she\nmade an initial down payment for their services on March 12, 2008.  The firm set up a payment plan\nto resolve 17 of Applicant\u2019s debts.  The monthly payment was set at $539.  At the time of the\nhearing, five debts had been removed from Applicant\u2019s credit report after she disputed them, and\nseven others remained unresolved.  Counting her salary and child support, Applicant claimed\nsufficient income to cover her living expenses with $725 remaining, thereby giving her the ability\nto make the $539 monthly payment.  However, as of the date of the hearing, Applicant admitted that\nshe had not made any payments on any of her debts or on the debt reduction plan for the past six\nmonths.  She promised to try to pay off her debts in the future.\n\n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.      \nTo the extent that the Judge\u2019s factual findings are relevant to the assigned error, they will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,\n43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and \u00b6 E3.1.33.3.  \u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d\nDep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n \n          \n\nMC 20(b) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\n1\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d\nMC 20(c) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(c): \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\n2\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d\nMC 20(d) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(d): \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\n3\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d\n4\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s application of Guideline F Mitigating\nConditions (MC) 20(b),  20(c),  and 20(d)  is unsupported by the record evidence.  Department\n1\n2\n3\nCounsel\u2019s contention has merit.  \nThe Judge found \u201cpartial application\u201d of MC 20(b) in Applicant\u2019s case.  Decision at 6.  The\nJudge cited Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment.  As Department Counsel\npoints out, Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were brief\u2013three to four months in 2002 and 1\u00bd\nmonths in 2003, as well as six weeks of unpaid maternity leave in 2007; and Applicant received\nunemployment compensation during those periods.  To the extent that Applicant has experienced\nfinancial difficulties beyond her control, Applicant has not shown a direct connection between her\nemployment history and her present financial situation.  The Board has held that such a connection,\nor nexus, must be established in order for the first portion of MC 20(b) to be applicable.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-23362 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2008).  Moreover, the second prong of MC 20(b)\nrequires that an applicant act responsibly under the circumstances.  While Applicant testified that\nshe  worked for a reduced salary from 2002 until 2004, she stated that she lived beyond her means\nbetween 2003 and 2006 and did not reduce her expenses to account for her reduced salary.\nTranscript at 68-70.  Applicant also testified that she had made no payments on her debts for\n\u201cprobably longer\u201d than six months prior to the hearing.  Transcript at 89.  She had resources to do\nso at that time.  Decision at 6.  Therefore, the record does not support the application of MC20(b)\nin Applicant\u2019s case.\nThe Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s actions with regard to her debts were \u201csufficient to\ntrigger partial application\u201d of MC 20(c) and MC 20(d).  Decision at 6.  The actions the Judge cited\nwere Applicant\u2019s hiring of a debt-consolidation firm; her calls to some of her creditors, which\nresulted in the deletion of either five or six debts from her credit reports (Decision at 3 and 6); and\nher submission of a budget which indicated that she had a sufficient surplus left every month after\npayment of her living expenses, with which she was able to pay the amount set by the debt-\nconsolidation firm.  Id. at 3.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in even partial application of MC 20(c) and\nMC 20(d), because there is little or no indication that Applicant\u2019s situation is yet being resolved or\nis under control or that Applicant has yet initiated a good-faith effort to repay her creditors or\notherwise resolve her debt.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant did not clearly understand what\nthe financial firm she had hired would do, and she did not know which of her debts would be\n\n5\nincluded in the firm\u2019s repayment plan.  Transcript at 82-90.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant\nhad made no payments on her debts.  Id. at 85-89.  In the absence of payments under the plan, it\ncannot be said that there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d\nas required for application of MC 20(c).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11,\n2003).  Furthermore, Applicant indicated that she had made no payments on any of her debts in six\nmonths or longer, even though the budget she submitted indicated that she had more left every month\nin discretionary income than the $539 she would eventually need for the firm\u2019s repayment plan.\nDecision at 3.  In the absence of a meaningful track record of repayments, it cannot reasonably be\nsuggested here that Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay her creditors or otherwise\nresolve her debts, as is required for application of MC 20(d).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2003).  Moreover, promises of future repayment are not a substitute for a history\nof payment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-31872 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2005).  Thus, the record\ndoes not support the application of MC 20(c) and MC 20(d).\nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is contrary to and\nunsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis relied in large part on the MCs she applied.  While noting that Applicant had made\nno payments under the repayment plan, the Judge concluded that the debts covered by the plan had\nbeen resolved.  Decision at 7.  As discussed above, it cannot be said that debts are being resolved\nin such a situation when an applicant has not yet begun making payments, especially when she had\nresources to do so.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 3 (Jun. 11, 2003).  The Judge then\nindicated that in spite of Applicant\u2019s lack of payments under the repayment plan, she based her\nanalysis on a favorable credibility determination.  Decision at 7.  While deference is to be given to\na Judge\u2019s credibility determination, such a determination is not immune from review, and it cannot\ntake the place of substantive evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00789 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 28,\n2006).  The totality of evidence in this case does not reasonably support the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED. \n \nSigned: Michael D.

On February 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 22, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to \nJune 19, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nme. A Notice of Hearing was issued the same day and the case was heard on May 15, \n2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibit (AE) A into evidence \nwithout objection.  At the conclusions of the hearing, I left the record open until May 29, \n2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On that day, \nApplicant submitted exhibits that I marked as AE B through E and admitted into the \nrecord without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non May 27, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.y of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. She is married, but currently separated. She has a 12-\nyear-old child from a former relationship and a six-month year old child from her \nmarriage. Since August 2004, she has worked for a federal contractor. She is a security \nofficer in a building that contains classified information. Prior to this job, she worked for \nother security firms beginning in October 2002. From February 1996 to October 2002, \nshe was a pre-board screener at an airport for a security company. \n \n \nOver the course of her years as a security officer, Applicant has experienced \nperiods of unemployment and under-employment. In 2002, she was off work for three to \nfour months; in 2003, she was out of work for a month and a half; and in 2007, she was \nunemployed for six weeks after her baby was born. During those times, she received \nunemployment compensation of about $200 every two weeks, which was significantly \nless than her salary.  (Tr. 64).  \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant received credit cards from five department stores and two \ncredit card companies that she used for holiday presents and some expenses. (Tr. 50-\n51). Initially, she was able to manage the credit card bills on her net monthly salary of \n$1,900. However, after she was laid off for three of four months in 2002, her debts \nbegan to accumulate. In her next position, she had a net monthly income of $1,450.1 \n(Tr. 64-65). That reduced salary, coupled with another month of unemployment in 2003, \nexacerbated her financial difficulties. She admitted that from 2003 to 2006, she was \nspending more money that she was earning, having not adjusted her expenses to her \nreduced salary. She tried to obtain a loan to pay off her debts, but was unable due to a \npoor credit rating. (Tr. 63).   \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories inquiring about 26 \ndelinquent debts.  She acknowledged all of the debts and in response to the status of \neach debt stated that she \u201ccannot afford to pay off debt due to financial problem will try \n                                            \n1In her previous position, Applicant earned $15 per hour; in her next position, she earned $8-9 \nper hour. Currently, she earns $11.89 per hour. (Tr. 71). \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nto resolve the debt in the near future.\u201d [Sic]. She honestly answered those questions, to \nthe best of her ability, because she did not want to lie. (Tr. 79). On February 29, 2008, \nshe sought financial help with a credit-counseling firm, in order to establish a repayment \nplan. (Tr. 80; AE A).  On March 12, 2008, she paid the company $276, as an initial \ndown payment to begin work on the plan. (Tr. 84). The plan includes 17 creditors that \nwill be paid monthly. The account balance for those creditors is $15,178. (AE E). She is \nnot certain when all of the debts will be paid, because the company intends to contact \nthe creditors to negotiate further settlements. (Tr. 85).  Her monthly payment will be \n$539. (AE E).  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CRB) from January 2006, July 2007 and \nOctober 2007, the SOR alleged 25 delinquent debts, totaling $16,416.2 (GE 3, 4 & 5). \nTwelve debts are included in a repayment plan:  \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, \n1.q, 1.s, 1.u and w, and 1.v.  They total $10,702.  Five debts have been deleted from \nher CRB after she inquired about them:  \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.n., 1.r, 1.x, and 1.y. (Tr. 45-49). They \ntotal $3,452.  Seven debts are unresolved: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.t. They \ntotal $2,262 and include four medical bills.3  \n \n \nToday, Applicant does not believe that she is living beyond her financial means. \n(Tr. 70). According to her budget, she has a net monthly income of $1,566 from her job, \nand receives $1,200 per months in child support from her husband and former \nboyfriend, increasing her total net monthly income to $2,766.4 Her monthly expenses \nare approximately $2,146. After paying those expenses, she has $725 remaining, of \nwhich $539 will be used for her repayment plan. She admitted that she has not made a \npayment on any of the debts for the past six months or on the debt reduction plan, as of \nthe date of this hearing. None of the creditors have contacted her since she began \nworking with the credit-counseling firm. (Tr. 89).                                                                 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted her 2007/2008 Annual Performance Appraisal & Planning \nForm. According to her supervisor, she is performing, over-all, satisfactorily.  She \nreceived a \u201cSolid Performance\u201d rating in half of the performance categories, and a \n\u201cNeeds Improvement\u201d in the other half.  (AE E).  At the time of the hearing, she did not \nbelieve she had received a previous evaluation from her employer, and may not have, \ngiven the fact that she signed said appraisal on May 29, 2008, which was subsequent to \nthe hearing. \n \n \n \nApplicant is aware of the employment problems created by her delinquent debts. \nIn her closing argument, she stated, \u201cAll I can say, I\u2019m going to try to pay off my debts.\u201d \n(Tr. 114). I believe her. \n \n                                            \n2SOR \u00b6 1.u and \u00b6 1.w are duplicate debts. \n3 Applicant claimed she disputed some of the seven debts, but did not supply any documentation \nverifying her assertion.  \n4At the hearing, it was apparent from Applicant\u2019s testimony that she did not realize that she \nshould include all child support payments as income in her budget. (AE E).   \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, three \nof which may be applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant began \naccumulating delinquent debt in 2002 that she did not begin resolving until recently, due \nto a lack of finances or ability to pay them. The evidence is sufficient to raise those two \npotentially disqualifying conditions. She also admitted that from 2003 to 2006, she was \n\u201cconsistently spending beyond one\u2019s means\u201d due to a reduced income, which potentially \nraises a disqualification under AG \u00b6 19(e).     \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties: \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and. \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n  \n Applicant=s financial worries arose around 2002 and continue into 2008. \nBecause the problems have been ongoing for at least six years, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot \napply.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts began accumulating as a result of a period of unemployment, \nfollowed by under-employment, and then additional short periods of unemployment. \nThose circumstances were outside of her control. She asserted that she attempted to \nmanage some debts by obtaining a loan, but did not present any documentary evidence \nto corroborate her statement. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application in this case.  \n \nOn February 6, 2008, DOHA issued the SOR, notifying Applicant of the \ndelinquent debts that were a concern. On February 29, 2008, Applicant sought \nprofessional assistance to manage her debts. She also called various creditors to \ninvestigate their claims, which resulted in the deletion of six debts from her credit file. In \nMarch 2008, she entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation company that will \ninitiate resolution and repayment of twelve of the debts listed on the SOR, and made a \ndown payment on that plan.  She submitted a copy of her budget that indicates she has \nsufficient funds to make payments on her outstanding financial obligations. These \nactions are sufficient to trigger partial application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d), \nindicating that has taken some affirmative action to resolve her debts and bring them \nunder control.  As she has not documented payments on the plan, full application is not \nwarranted. \n \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 32-year-old woman, \nwho \nhas \nexperienced \nfinancial \ndifficulties \nas \na \nresult \nof \nunemployment, \nunderemployment, in addition to an acknowledged mismanagement of her finances, as \nwell as an over-all lack of financial sophistication or understanding. After learning of the \nGovernment\u2019s specific concerns, she promptly initiated steps to resolve them, indicating \nthat she assumed responsibility for the debts. She intends to repay them and has not \ncontemplated filing bankruptcy as a means of resolution. The SOR alleged delinquent \ndebts totaling approximately $16,400, of which the debt repayment plan will resolve \n$10,700. She resolved about $3,400 of the debt after disputing them. (The plan also \nincludes other debts and estimates an account balance of $15,000.) In summary, she \nhas resolved all but $2,200 of the SOR listed debts, which is sufficient at this time. \n \nI recognize that as of May 29, 2008, Applicant has not made a payment on the \nplan other than the service fee. However, after listening to her testimony and observing \nher demeanor, I am convinced that she will pay her debts. She gave candid answers \nduring the hearing about her debts. She is now very aware of the importance of \nresolving them, in view of the problems they have created for her employment. In \naddition, I do not find that she, in her position as a security officer, would be susceptible \nto engaging in illegal acts that would compromise classified information in order \ngenerate money. Given her awareness of the problem, along with a budget that can \naccommodate her repayment plan, I do not believe similar financial problems will recur. \nThere is no other evidence in her background to indicate that her financial delinquencies \nmay create a security risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.y:  \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Stein, Esquire\nNovember 19, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 18,\n2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On March 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 17, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non May 15, 2008.  I received the case assignment on May 19, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on June 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June\n27, 2008.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were\n\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on July 11, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain\na security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c. of the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby\ndeemed findings of fact.  \nHe denied subparagraph 1.d. as written.  Specifically, the Applicant disputed the\nblood alcohol levels in the original allegation.  The Government agreed that they were\nincorrect.  The evidence showed that the Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol level for this incident\nwas .09%.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 11.)  At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of\nthe proceeding, with the consent of both parties, this allegation was amended to\ncomport with the facts presented.  (Transcript at 80.)  The corrected version reads as\nfollows:\nd.  You were arrested on or about July 4, 2006, in [city and state\nredacted], and charged with (1) Driving While Under the Influence of\nAlcohol/Drugs, (2) Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol with BAC\n.08% or more, and (3) Hit and Run - Property Damage.  Your Blood\nAlcohol Content was .09%.  Pursuant to a plea bargain, you pleaded guilty\nto Count (3) and Counts (1) and (2) were dismissed.  You were found\nguilty and fined approximately $500.00, placed on one year probation, and\nyour drivers license was suspended for one year. \nThe Applicant has had three alcohol related arrests - in 1984, 1997 and 2006.\nThe Applicant was arrested in 1984 for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  He\nwas 23 or 24 years old at the time.  He pleaded No Contest to the DUI charge and his\nsentence included a fine, probation and two weekends of community service.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 5.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related arrest happened in November 1997.  On\nthat occasion, the Applicant went to a bar with another person who was supposed to be\nthe designated driver on that occasion.  When the Applicant was ready to leave, the\ndesignated driver was not.  After some conversation, the designated driver allowed the\nApplicant to drive his car.  The Applicant was subsequently arrested for DUI and DUI\nWith Blood Alcohol Over .08%.  The Applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five\n\n3\ndays in jail, fined, ordered to attend DUI school, his drivers license was suspended for\nfour months, and he was placed on five years probation.  The Applicant has stated that\nthis was an unusual situation and that he is not an irresponsible person.  (Government\nExhibit 3 at 12-21; Transcript at 70-71.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s third alcohol related arrest occurred on July 4, 2006.  The\nevidence concerning this last incident is mixed.  About three months before the incident\noccurred, the Applicant began taking the prescription drug Ambien because he had\ndifficulty sleeping.  The Applicant has repeatedly stated that he has little to no direct\nmemory of this incident.  On the day in question he was repairing his car and drank\nabout six beers.  He also stated to the police that he had taken an Ambien that evening.\nThere is evidence that combining Ambien and alcohol can cause a serious reaction,\nakin to sleep walking.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Sometime during the evening the\nApplicant took his car out for a drive and ran into a building.  After hitting the building he\ndrove away, then returned to his residence.  A neighbor called police to report the\nApplicant for driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was arrested and charged with\nDUI, DUI With Blood Alcohol Over .08% and Hit and Run - Property Damage.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 1-11.)  Pursuant to a plea bargain, the Applicant plead guilty\nto Hit and Run - Property Damage and the other two counts were dismissed.  He was\nfined, placed on one year probation and his drivers license was suspended for one year.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 4-5; Government Exhibit 3; Transcript at 33-37, 47-61.)\nSince the 2006 incident the Applicant has severely limited his alcohol intake.  He\ndoes not believe that he has a problem with alcohol, and contends that alcohol does not\nrule his life. (Transcript at 40, 66-69.)\nMitigation\nA co-worker of the Applicant testified that, in his field, the Applicant is an expert.\nThe witness has had to report other co-workers for alcohol problems in the past and has\nnot seen any evidence of that with the Applicant.  Finally, the witness finds the Applicant\nto be a very trustworthy person.  (Transcript at 15-27.) \nThe Applicant also submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  His two most recent annual evaluations from his job\nshow that he \u201cMeets Standards\u201d or \u201cExceeds Standards\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)  \nSeveral friends and work associates submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nHe is described as someone who has \u201cintegrity,\u201d is \u201cdependable,\u201d \u201cloyal,\u201d and \u201can\nasset.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\n\n4\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG & 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was involved in three alcohol related incidents in 1984, 1997 and\n2006.  The first two incidents clearly were solely alcohol-related.  Based on the state of\nthe record, it cannot be said with any degree of certainty how much alcohol had to do\nwith the third incident.  Obviously the court felt alcohol was involved to a degree, since\nthe Applicant\u2019s drivers license was suspended for a year. \nThe Applicant has used alcohol, occasionally to excess, from 1978 until July\n2006.  He continues to consume alcohol, but at a much lower rate.\nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions that arguably apply to this case.  AG \u00b6\n22(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22(c) states a concern is, \u201cHabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating condition currently\napplies to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23(a) states that it can be a mitigating\nconditions when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d\nWhen viewed in the light least favorable to the Applicant, he has had three\nalcohol related arrests in 22 years.  While certainly nothing to be taken lightly, there is,\nin my opinion, no evidence of a pattern of abuse here.  His last incident occurred two\nyears before the record closed and may well have involved an accidental use of Ambien\nwith alcohol.  This mitigating condition applies and, when viewed along with the Whole\nPerson Concept discussion below, supports a finding for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n6\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has had three alcohol related incidents in 22 years.\nThere is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or that he is alcohol\ndependent or an alcohol abuser.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the\nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at\nlength above, I find that the conduct was not recent (AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)); that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 10, 2007.  He admitted all \nfactual allegations but denied they raised a security concern.  He elected to have the \nmatter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s written case on January 7, 2008.  Applicant received a complete file \nof relevant material (FORM) on January 22, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nfile objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions.  Applicant submitted additional information in an undated letter received by \nDOHA on February 8, 2008.  Department Counsel had no objection to consideration of \nthe additional material.  The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2008.  Based on \na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old unmarried employee of a defense contractor who has \napplied, as part of his employment, for a security clearance.  He is working for the \ndefense contractor as a student intern.  Applicant anticipates graduating from college in \nspring 2008, and being employed full time by the defense contractor. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant listed on his security clearance application (Item 5) that he used the \nfollowing illegal drugs: \n \n(a) Adderall ten times from July 2005 until January 2006; \n(b) Alprozolan once in December 2005; \n(c) Cannabis six times from June until December 2005 \n(d) MDMA (ectacy) four times form July until December 2005; \n(e) Oxycodene ten times from June until December 2005; \n(f) Valium once in December 2005; \n(g) Diazepam once in December 2005; \n(h) Psilocybin once in July 2005; \n(i) Fentanyl once in July 2005; \n(j) Clonazepam once in July 2005; \n(k) Cocaine once in June 2005. \n \nApplicant also admits to the above use of illegal drugs in his answer to the SOR. \n(Item 4).  He also admitted to the use of the illegal drugs to security investigators.  In \naddition to the use of the above illegal drugs from June 2005 until January 2006, \nApplicant admits to using \u201cSalivia\u201d in December 2006, just prior to being interviewed by \nsecurity investigators.  Applicant describes \u201cSalivia\u201d as a legal substance.  Slavia is an \nherb grown in Mexico.  There has been a recent interest among young adults and \nadolescents to rediscover ethno-botanical plants that can induce changes in perception, \nhallucinations, or other psychologically-induced changes.  Since Slavia or any of its \nactive ingredients are not specifically listed in the Controlled Substance Act, some on-\nline botanical companies and drug promotional sites have advertised Salvia as a legal \nalternative to other plant hallucinogens like mescaline.  The plant material is smoked for \nthe induction of \u201cmystical\u201d or hallucinogenic experiences.  A dose of 200 to 500 \nmicrograms produces profound hallucinations when smoked.  Field tests show its \neffects are similar to mescaline. (Item 7 at 14)  The substance caused him to have \nstrong hallucinations.  His vision was okay, but his mind was distorted. (Item 6 at 5)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was a full time college student when he experimented with drugs from \nJune 2005 until January 2006.  He used the drugs out of curiosity and experimentation.  \nHis use was usually in public settings at college events such as fraternity parties.  He \npurchased the drugs from individuals for his own use.  He admitted using drugs at work.  \nAn anonymous person reported his drug use to university officials.  The university \nconsidered him a \u201clow risk\u201d for drug abuse, so he only had to attend a drug awareness \nclass from December 2005 until January 2006.  He stopped using drugs at the urging of \nhis parents and school officials.  (Item 6 at 3) \n \nApplicant does not feel drugs had an adverse impact on his judgment, reliability, \nor personality.  He does not feel his use of drugs from June 2005 until January 2006 \nhad an adverse impact on his work, school, home, or friendships.  One of his reasons \nfor stopping the use of drugs was that he would be working at a position requiring a \nsecurity clearance.  He never had a positive drug test.  He no longer uses illegal drugs.  \nHe admitted in response to questions from security investigators in December 2005 that \nhe would not use drugs more than once a year, usually on his birthday. (Item 6 at 4)  \nOnce he has a family, he will not use illegal drugs. (Item 6)  In response to \ninterrogatories in September 2007, he stated he would not use illegal drugs again. (Item \n6 at 8)   \n \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant states that he experimented with drugs for \nonly a short time and it should not be construed as a lifestyle portrait.  He argues that \nwhen he used Salvia in December 2006, it was a legal drug and not a continuation of \nhis use of illegal drugs.  His experimentation with drugs for eight months is not a \nrepresentation of his character.  He stated that he openly and honestly admitted his \nmistake of using illegal drugs in the past.   He made a poor choice in experimenting with \ndrugs for that time.  If Slavia had been illegal, he would not have used it.  He admits his \npoor judgment during the eight months of drug use, but his other 250 months of life \nshow his good judgment.  His self-discipline and good judgment are shown by his \npending graduation from college with highest honors, his lack of a criminal record, a \nclean academic and education record, and his good credit rating.  He committed to his \nparents and his school that he would stop using illegal drugs, and he did so.   \n \n \nApplicant also noted that as of January 2008, the period of time he has not used \ndrugs exceeded the period of time of experimentation by a factor of 3.  He avoided the \nconditions and circumstances under which he used drugs.  He understands two years of \nnon-drug use is short, but he is willing to sign a statement of intent to never use illegal \ndrugs again.  He is willing to be randomly screened for drug use or have his honesty \ntested in any way.  He admits to making mistakes in the past but that he has been \nforthright, honest, and completely candid during the security process.  (Case file, \nAnswer to FORM). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement: \n \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or the misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are defined as mood and behavior \naltering substances, and include drugs identifies and listed in the Controlled Substance \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAct of 1970, as well as inhalants and other similar substances.  Drug abuse is the illegal \nuse of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical directions. (AG \u00b6 24) \n \n \nConditions that raise a security concern and could disqualify a person are Drug \nInvolvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse), and AG \u00b6 25(c) \n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia).  The disqualifying conditions are \nestablished because Applicant admitted to using a variety of illegal drugs or prescribed \ndrugs that deviated from approved medical direction over an approximately eight month \nperiod of time.  He also admitted purchasing the drugs.  He had to possess the drugs to \nuse them. \n \n \nI considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment).  Applicant\u2019s main experimentation with drugs was \nfrom June 2005 until January 2006, but he did use a drug in December 2006.  While \nApplicant claims the drug was legal, he does admit it caused him to hallucinate.  Even \nthough it may be legal, it is mind altering since it causes hallucinations.  This mitigating \ncondition does not apply since his last use was about 15 months ago, he used drugs a \nnumber of times a month during experimentation time so his use was not infrequent, \nand experimentation is not an unusual occurrence. \n \n \n \nAg \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts: (2) changing or avoiding \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) \napplies in part.  It appears that Applicant has changed his environment and is not \nassociating with drug abusers.  He realizes drug abuse will affect his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  He expresses a willingness to execute a statement concerning \nautomatic withdrawal of security clearance for a violation of the drug abuse policy.  \nHowever, his last drug use was just about 15 months ago.  While he classifies that drug \nas a legal drug, it was a hallucinogen and did cause Applicant to hallucinate.  It does not \nshow good judgment, reliability or trustworthiness to use a drug that causes \nhallucinations.  While his vow not to use drugs in the future seems sincere, it is not \nsufficient to overcome the security concern for drug abuse.  He vowed before to his \nparents and school officials not to abuse drugs, but he went against that vow in \nDecember 2006 when he used Slavia.  He stated he would not have used the drug if he \nthought it was illegal.  Since it was legal, he stated he used it.  The drug caused \nhallucinations which show that it could affect his reliability and good judgment and his \nability to protect classified information.  It also shows a propensity to rationalize drug \nuse.  I find against Applicant for drug involvement. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct: \n \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance process depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s response concerning his \nfuture use of drugs raises security concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nCondition AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant \nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He states he was open and candid \nduring the security investigative process, providing all information to the best of his \nknowledge.  In December 2006, he stated to investigators that he would only use illegal \ndrugs about once a year on special occasion like his birthday.  In September 2007, he \nstated he had decided not to use illegal drugs even on special occasions.  While there is \na security concern for falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the Government when applying for a security clearance, every inaccurate \nstatement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is \ndeliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  The sequencing and timing of the \nstatements are perfectly conceivable and appropriate.  Applicant first believed he would \nonly use drugs occasionally.  After reflection, he decided later not to use drugs again.  \nHe did not intentionally falsify information during the security clearance process.  I find \nfor Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered that Applicant is young and about to complete college.  I considered \nthat he anticipates graduating with honors from a difficult program at a prestigious \ncollege.  While in school, he experimented with drugs, a fact he now regrets.  However, \nhe did experiment with a variety of drugs for six to eight months over two years ago.  He \nthen used a hallucinogenic drug just over a year ago.  Even though he claims the drug \nis legal, it did cause him to hallucinate.  This recent use of hallucinogenic agents and a \nhis ingness to use mind altering drugs shows he exercises bad judgment.  His use of \ndrugs raises questions about his trustworthiness, responsibility, and good judgment.  I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement.  Clearance is denied. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n and i.o: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on January 2, 2008. She denied\nParagraphs 1 and 3, denied subparagraphs 2.b through 2.c, 2.e, and 2.k through 2.l,\nadmitted the remainder, and requested a hearing. I received the case assignment on\nJanuary 23, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 20, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2008. During the hearing, I received\nthree government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the hearing\nApril 15, 2008\n\n2\ntranscript (Tr.) on March 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for occupying a sensitive position is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old single woman with a child from a prior marriage, age\n14. She earned a GED in 1996 and has attended some classes at a technical college.\nSince September 2005, she has worked for a health insurance company as a customer\nservice representative.\nIn 1994, Applicant donated her kidney to a family member. Since then, she has\nexperienced a number of recurring side effects that have required medical treatment\n(Tr. 52). She had another major medical surgery in 2001.\nApplicant had health insurance, but was unable to pay the copays and\ndeductibles. Gradually the medical bills grew delinquent. A two-year unemployment\nbetween 1999 and 2001 further strained her finances. \nBy late August 2007, Applicant had accrued approximately $16,000 of delinquent\ndebt, including delinquent medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 2.a, 2.d, 2.f, 2.j, 2.m, and\n2.n), the deficiency on a repossessed car (SOR subparagraph 2.e), three phone\naccounts (SOR subparagraphs 2.c, 2.k though 2.l), and a department store account\n(SOR subparagraph 2.b). Applicant\u2019s sister opened the phone accounts and the\ndepartment store account in her name without her knowledge. In October 2007, she\ncontacted the creditors, and negotiated reduced settlement amounts (Tr. 47-48) She\nwrote the credit reporting company in January 2008 to get them removed from her credit\nreport (Tr. 41). \nApplicant also has negotiated reduced a settlement amount for subparagraph\n2.c. As for the deficiency resulting from the repossession, she unsuccessfully attempted\nto negotiate a settlement shortly after the creditor repossessed the car in 2003 (Tr. 23).\nThe original creditor is no longer in business, and she has been unable to locate the\ncurrent creditor. \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies are the medical bills. Most stem from\ntreatment she received at the same treatment facility. \nCurrently, Applicant has satisfied none of her delinquencies. Her goal is to begin\npaying the delinquent utilities and the department store account, then begin paying the\nlarger, medical delinquencies.\nIn June 2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF\n85P). She listed none of her delinquencies that were more than 180 overdue, as\nrequired. At the hearing, she asserted that her omission was unintentional (Tr. 25).\n\nThe interrogatories were undated.\n1\n3\nIn December 2005, Applicant worked as a manager at a check cashing company.\nShe stole $1,000 from her employer, then called the police and falsely reported that she\nwas robbed at gunpoint. Later, she was charged with filing a false police report,\npleaded guilty, and was ordered to pay restitution. The debts listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 2.a through 2.h were in delinquent status at the time she stole from her\nemployer.\nAt the hearing, Applicant denied stealing from her employer, and reiterated that\nshe was robbed at gunpoint. The government propounded interrogatories concerning\nthis incident to Applicant in approximately August 2007.  In a signed, sworn response,\n1\nshe explained, among other things, \u201cit was me being stupid - immature . . . Report was\nfiled thinking I wouldn\u2019t get caught . . .\u201d (Exhibit 2). When asked by department counsel\nto reconcile the discrepancy between her hearing testimony and her interrogatory\nresponse, Applicant explained that she was lying when she executed the interrogatory\nresponse (Tr. 35-36).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to sensitive information,\nthe administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, [or] trustworthiness . . . \u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual\n\n4\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d apply.\nI have considered all of the mitigating condition and conclude none apply.\nAlthough a history of medical problems and a two-year unemployment significantly\ncontributed to the accrual of her delinquencies, and she has recently been researching\nher debts and negotiating with creditors, she has not yet begun satisfying any. Also,\nbefore she began organizing her finances, she stole $1,000 from a former employer.\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations disqualifying conditions.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability [and] trustworthiness . . .\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s SF 85P\nomission raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant committed a crime of dishonesty when she stole from her employer\nand filed a false police report. Despite pleading guilty to the crime, and later discussing\nit comprehensively during the investigative process in her response to interrogatories,\nshe denied committing the crime at the hearing. Under these circumstances, her\nexplanation for omitting this information from her SF 85P is not credible. I conclude AG\n\u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s false report conviction and SF 85P\nfalsification trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or\nconvicted.\u201d For the same reasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the criminal conduct disqualifying conditions.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial difficulties and repeated demonstrations of\ndishonesty render her an unacceptable candidate for occupying a sensitive position.\nConsidering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the whole\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a sensitive position must\nbe denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for occupying a\nsensitive position. Eligibility is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 20, 2007. On \nApril 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H, E, and J. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 15, 2010; answered it on May 6, 2010; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on May \n10, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 14, 2010, and the case \nwas assigned to me on July 20, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 30, \n2010, scheduling it for August 18, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non August 26, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, \n2.b, and 3.a. He stated that he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.b, alleging falsification of a \nsecurity clearance application, but his answer made it clear that he admitted providing \nincorrect information but denied intentional falsification. I have treated his answers to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.b as denials. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old designer employed by a defense contractor since \nSeptember 2006. He began working for his current employer shortly after receiving an \nassociate\u2019s degree from college. He is unmarried and has no children. He has never \nheld a security clearance.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in January 2007 \n(GX 1), he provided detailed information about previous residences, persons who knew \nhim at each residence, his educational background, his foreign travel, and his \nemployment record. He disclosed that he was fired from his job in a grocery store for \neating store food. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24, asking if he had illegally used any \ncontrolled substance since the age of 16 or during the last seven years. He wrote, \n\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d in the space for additional comments at the end of the \napplication.  \n \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with permitting, \nestablishing or maintaining a common nuisance; possession of cocaine; and possession \nof marijuana with intent to distribute. At the time, Applicant was living with two male \nroommates. Based on an anonymous complaint about noise, the smell of marijuana, \nand the number of people coming and going from the home, the police searched the \nhome pursuant to a \u201ccommon nuisance\u201d warrant. They seized marijuana, cocaine \nresidue, baggies, a scale, and drug paraphernalia. The scale and baggies were found in \nApplicant\u2019s room. One of Applicant\u2019s roommates admitted that the cocaine was his and \nnot Applicant\u2019s. (GX 2 at 6.)  \n \nApplicant notified his security officer of his arrest. (Tr. 43.) He pleaded guilty to \nthe nuisance offense, not guilty to possession of cocaine, and guilty to possession of \nmarijuana with intent to distribute. For the nuisance offense, he was sentenced to 12 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmonths in jail (suspended), a $250 fine, and probation for 12 months. For the marijuana \npossession, he was sentence to 12 months in jail (suspended) and a $2,500 fine. (GX 3; \nGX 4.) \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator about his \narrest. Even though a scale and baggies were seized from his room and he pleaded \nguilty to possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, he denied selling marijuana and \ntold the investigator that he used the scale to weigh his own purchases. During the \ncourse of the interview, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana 10 to 15 times over \na four-month period before his arrest. (GX 2 at 8.) There is nothing in the record \nsuggesting that the investigator knew about Applicant\u2019s prior use of marijuana before \nthe interview. \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator about \nhis failure to disclose his marijuana use on his security clearance application. He told \nthe investigator he thought the question about illegal drug use applied only to arrests or \ncharges of illegal drug use. (GX 2 at 5-6.) At the hearing, he testified that he hurriedly \ncompleted his application and did not carefully read the questions. (Tr. 40)  \n \n \nApplicant now has his own home and recently purchased a new car. He no \nlonger associates with his former drug-using friends. At the hearing, he was enthusiastic \nabout his job. He is taking college courses with a view toward obtaining a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in nuclear engineering. (Tr. 33-34.) He has not received any drug treatment or \ncounseling, but he has not used illegal drugs since his arrest in February 2007. \n \n \nA lifelong friend of Applicant, who is also employed by a defense contractor and \nholds a security clearance, testified that Applicant has always been a good friend. The \nwitness had no first-hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s drug use. The witness testified that \nApplicant is \u201chard headed\u201d and sometimes \u201cjust needs something to rattle his cage a \nlittle bit.\u201d The witness testified that Applicant has become more responsible since his \narrest. (Tr. 50-52.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s live-in girlfriend for the past two years testified that she would not live \nwith him if he were still using drugs. She considers him to be responsible, hard working \nand trustworthy. (Tr. 54-56.) \n \n \nA friend and coworker who has known Applicant for four years submitted a letter \ndescribing him as \u201cdependable, reliable, trustworthy, caring, courteous, and genuine.\u201d At \nwork, Applicant \u201cdisplays professionalism, leadership, willingness to help others, and \nalways goes above and beyond his work assignments and work ethics.\u201d (AX A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n4 \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from at least 2006 to at least \nFebruary 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It also alleges that \nhe was arrested in February 2007 for maintaining a common nuisance, possession of a \ncontrolled substance, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute; that he was \nconvicted, pursuant to his pleas of guilty, of the nuisance offense and possession of \nmarijuana with intent to distribute; and that he was sentenced to suspended jail time, \nfines, and probation (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Finally, it alleges that Applicant used marijuana after \nsubmitting a security clearance questionnaire (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: AUse of an illegal drug or \nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1) explains that Guideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d  \n \nThe evidence raises the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction\u201d; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nMore than three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s arrest. He used marijuana \nfor about four months, a relatively short period. The cocaine found during the search \nbelonged to one of Applicant\u2019s roommates, and there is no evidence Applicant used \ncocaine. Since his arrest, he has moved away from his fellow drug-users, matured, \nbecome seriously involved with a young woman who will not tolerate drug use, worked \nhard, continued his education, and gained a reputation for dependability and \ntrustworthiness. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is established.  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes the first \nthree prongs of this mitigating condition. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance \napplication by answering \u201cNo\u201d to question 24, asking if he had ever illegally used any \ncontrolled substance, such as marijuana, since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, \nand by failing to disclose his marijuana use from 2006 to at least January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). It also cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.d, his use of marijuana after submitting his security \nclearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s security clearance \napplication is AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire.\u201d When a falsification allegation is \ncontroverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. An omission, \nstanding alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \nomission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s \nlevel of education and business experience are relevant in determining whether a failure \nto disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. \nISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he had no record of \ndrug offenses. It was only after his arrest that the identity of his fellow drug-users was \nknown. Applicant had considerable work experience and he had earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree. He presented himself at the hearing as intelligent and articulate. I find his \nexplanation for answering \u201cNo\u201d to question 24 implausible and not credible. His \nexplanation that he hurriedly completed the form is belied by the detailed information he \npresented throughout the form and the fact that he took the time to add the comment, \n\u201cThank your for your time,\u201d in the space for additional comments at the end of the form. \nHis intent to conceal the extent of his drug involvement was illustrated during the May \n2007 interview when he denied selling marijuana, even though a scale and baggies \nwere seized from his room and he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana with intent \nto distribute.  I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication or during a security interview may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). The security interview \nin May 2007 was triggered by Applicant\u2019s arrest. There is no evidence that the \ninvestigator was aware of Applicant\u2019s prior marijuana use until Applicant disclosed it. \nThus, it does not appear that he was \u201cconfronted\u201d with evidence of his prior marijuana \nuse. On the other hand, Applicant did not initiate the interview, nor did he initiate any \nother efforts to correct his response to question 24. He receives some credit for \nvoluntarily disclosing his prior marijuana use, but his lack of effort to correct his \nresponse to question 24 on his own initiative precludes full application of this mitigating \ncondition.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after submitting his security clearance application \nraises questions about his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, and it was likely to adversely affect his professional reputation among his \nneighbors, associates, and coworkers. Thus, his conduct raises the following \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and  \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established for Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security \nclearance application, because it was a serious offense undermining the integrity of the \nsecurity clearance process and a felony, as discussed below. Although significant time \nhas passed since Applicant falsified his application, he perpetuated his falsification in \nhis security interview in September 2007, his response to the SOR, and his testimony at \nthe hearing. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for the falsification.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s attempt to conceal the extent of his drug involvement in the May 2007 \ninterview, and his false explanation for his answer to question 24 that he offered in the \nSeptember 2007 interview, his response to the SOR, and his hearing testimony are not \nalleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; \nto evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations \nomitted). I have considered his lack of candor in the May 2007 and September 2007 \ninterviews, his response to the SOR, and his hearing testimony for these limited \npurposes. \n \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana since his arrest in February 2007. For the \nreasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 26(a), I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is \nestablished for Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after submitting his security clearance \napplication. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his illegal use of marijuana, \nfound new friends, become involved in a serious relationship with a young woman who \nwill not tolerate drug use, and has devoted his energies to his work. However, he has \nnot acknowledged his lack of candor on his security clearance application or during \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfollow-up interviews. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(d) is established for his use of marijuana \nafter submitting his security clearance application, but it is not established for his \nfalsification of his security clearance application.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). This mitigating condition is established because \nApplicant has belatedly disclosed the full extent of his drug involvement, stopped using \nillegal drugs, and terminated his contact with drug-users. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the drug-related conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and SOR \u00b6 3.b \ncross-alleges the falsification of his security clearance application alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations.\u201d The relevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201ca single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted\u201d). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J. Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction of drug-\nrelated offenses in February 2007 and his deliberately false answer on his security \nclearance application raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Security concerns also may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) and 26(a). I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are established for Applicant\u2019s \ndrug-related arrest and conviction in February 2007, but they are not established for his \nfalsification of his security clearance application.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a young adult, relatively new to the workplace and the \nresponsibilities inherent in a security clearance. He appears to have left his \nirresponsible collegiate lifestyle behind him. However, his lack of candor on his security \nclearance application and in subsequent proceedings raises serious concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and reliability.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, E, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement, but he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his lack of candor. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On November 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on November 21, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on March 20, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 27, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for April 22, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\ntwo exhibits.  The Applicant presented twenty-two exhibits and testified on his own\nbehalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on May 5, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 27).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 52 years of age and has a Masters Degree\nin Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as a Corporate Engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1955.  He came to the United States in\n1983, at the age of twenty-eight in pursuant of higher education.  He received his\npermanent residence in 1985, and became a United States citizen in October 1991.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  He currently possesses a valid United States passport.  In 1983,\nhe married a woman from Laos who has since become a United States citizen.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  She is employed as a United States Postal worker.  (Tr. p. 39).\nThey have two children who were born in the United States.  One is attending an Ivy\nLeague University, the other is still in high school.  The Applicant, his wife, and his\nchildren are committed to the American way of life and have made it their permanent\nhome.     \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother was a resident and citizen of Taiwan.  She passed away\nin April 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit V).  While she was alive, at times, the Applicant sent\nas much as $3,000.00 a year to assist in his mother\u2019s living expenses.  When she died,\nhe inherited nothing.        \nThe Applicant has two living family members in Taiwan; a younger brother and\nolder sister.  His brother manages and teaches courses at a private night school.  (Tr. p.\n44).  He has no knowledge that the Applicant is applying for a security clearance.  He is\nmarried and his wife is a high school teacher.  (Tr. p. 45).  The Applicant\u2019s sister is a\nretired housewife.  (Tr. p. 47).  Her husband runs a small window shop of produce and\nnoodles. They receive no benefits what so ever, nor do they participate in any political\nactivities concerning the Taiwanese Government.  (Tr. p. 48).  The Applicant is not\nclose to his siblings, and speaks to them on holidays, only once or twice a year.  (Tr. p.\n46).   \n\n3\nOver the past ten years, the Applicant traveled to Taiwan on four separate\noccasions.  The purpose for each of the four trips involved his mother\u2019s health.  He\ntraveled to Taiwan in 1998, 2006, in April 2007, to attend his mother\u2019s funeral, and in\nMarch 2008 to memorialize the one year anniversary of his mother\u2019s death.  On each of\nthese trips, he reported to his security department that he was traveling to Taiwan.  (Tr.\np. 50).  \nThe Applicant understands the responsibilities associated with holding a security\nclearance.  He has also received a Foreign Travel Defensive Security Briefing and\nunderstands the unique responsibilities associated with his job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit U).\nFurthermore, he indicated that if he were ever approached by anyone seeking\ninformation from him of any sort, he would report it to the proper authorities, (his\nsecurity department) and to the American consulate.  (Tr. pp. 49 and 52)\nThe Applicant has no assets in Taiwan and never plans to retire there.  He owns\na home in the United States valued at approximately $500,000.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R).\nHe has retirement accounts, including a 401K and an IRA, valued at approximately\n$600,000.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits O through Q).  He and his wife have checking accounts\nand savings, CD\u2019s, and E-Trade investment accounts valued at approximately\n$300,000.  (Tr. p. 54, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H, I, J, K, L, M, N).    \nLetters of recommendation from the Director of Corporate Facilities and Security,\nseveral Senior Directors, and the Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at the\ncompany, as well as customers who work with the Applicant, all attest to the Applicant\u2019s\nhigh standard of character, strong technical skills, loyalty, hard work ethic and kind\nheartedness.  The Applicant is said to always follows the rules, is extremely\nconscientious in handling classified information, and has never violated any security\nprocedures involving classified or proprietary materials.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C ,D,\nS and T). \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\n\n4\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence ad has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S, and 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s has two siblings who are residents and citizens of\nTaiwan, the Applicant is not close to them and except for holidays, rarely has contact\nwith them.  There is no evidence of a close bond or strong evidence of affection.  In fact,\nto the contrary, the Applicant\u2019s only speaks to them on holidays.  The Applicant\u2019s deep\nand abiding ties are here in the United States.  For the past twenty years he has worked\nhard to establish himself as a responsible, educated, American citizen.  His wife and\nchildren, are all citizens and residents of the United States.  His advanced education,\nemployment with the DOD, assets, that include his home, many investments and\nretirement benefits are all in the United States.  The Applicant essentially cut all ties\nfrom Taiwan when he moved to the United States and made it his permanent home for\nthe past twenty years.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Taiwan elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with his foreign siblings or to any foreign individual or to Taiwan in any way\nthat could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is no possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 58 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor, currently as a network administrator, since May 2006. Applicant moved to his current state of residence in 2004 and was unemployed from in or about September 2004 until March 2005. He thereafter held a series of short-term jobs until obtaining his current employment. Prior to moving to his current state of residence he was the owner-operator of a trucking business that at one time had three trucks and employee drivers. The economic impact following the events of September 11, 2001, eventually made Applicants\u2019s trucking business unprofitable. Applicant held a security clearance while employed as a senior field engineer for a government contractor from August 1987 until November 1995. No adverse action was ever taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance. Applicant was married in or about October 1992. Applicant testified he and his wife 2 lived together in a domestic-type relationship for some time prior to their marriage. They resided in a house he purchased in or about May 1985 before they began living together. Applicant has three children and two step-children from this relationship.

A notice of hearing was issued\non January 14, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 5, 2008. The hearing was\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 26, 2008\n\n The security clearance application submitted in May 2006 (GE 1) lists the date of his marriage as\n2\nOctober 8, 1992. However, Applicant consistently testified he had been married for over 20 years. \n2\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4. GE 1, 2, and 4 were admitted into the record\nwithout objection. Applicant\u2019s objection to the admission of GE 3 (a credit report) was\nsustained because one of the three pages of that document was missing. Department\nCounsel decided not to avail himself of the offer provided to him to obtain a complete copy\nof the document and instead indicated he was prepared to proceed without the exhibit. \nApplicant testified and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-5, and admitted into the record without objection. The record\nwas held open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents in support of his case.\nTwo additional documents were timely received, marked as AE 6 & 7, and admitted into\nthe record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding endorsement on AE 6 & 7,\nwhich contained arguments of Department Counsel on the significance of the additional\ndocuments, was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and included as part of the\nrecord. The transcript was received on February 27, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 58 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor, currently\nas a network administrator, since May 2006. Applicant moved to his current state of\nresidence in 2004 and was unemployed from in or about September 2004 until March\n2005. He thereafter held a series of short-term jobs until obtaining his current employment.\nPrior to moving to his current state of residence he was the owner-operator of a trucking\nbusiness that at one time had three trucks and employee drivers. The economic impact\nfollowing the events of September 11, 2001, eventually made Applicants\u2019s trucking\nbusiness unprofitable. Applicant held a security clearance while employed as a senior field\nengineer for a government contractor from August 1987 until November 1995. No adverse\naction was ever taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance.\nApplicant was married in or about October 1992.  Applicant testified he and his wife\n2\nlived together in a domestic-type relationship for some time prior to their marriage. They\nresided in a house he purchased in or about May 1985 before they began living together.\nApplicant has three children and two step-children from this relationship. Although he was\nuncertain of their exact ages, his children apparently range in age from about 18 to 37. \nSometime around the summer of 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife told him she wanted them\nto separate. Applicant\u2019s testimony indicates this was something he did not want to happen\nand it proved to be a very trying and emotional experience for him. He quit claimed his\ninterest in the marital residence to her and abruptly moved to another state. He presumed\nhis wife, who had been responsible for paying all household expenses during the course\n\n The debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b- e are included in the plan. The debt listed in\n3\nsubparagraph 1.f has been paid in full (AE 5). Applicant testified the debt listed in subparagraph 1.a will be\nincorporated into the plan when one of the other debts listed in the plan is satisfied. \n3\nof their marriage, would make whatever arrangements were necessary to pay off their\ndebts and they would eventually obtain a divorce. Instead, his wife neglected the bills and\nsold the house to a friend for about the amount that was owed on the mortgage.\nApplicant\u2019s wife traveled to the state where he had relocated at the end of 2004 and they\nreconciled. They did not discuss the sale of the house or what had happened to their\nfinances because Applicant found it too emotionally distressful to talk about and wanted\nto just put that chapter of their life behind him.\nA review of the credit reports in evidence, GE 4 and AE 2, unquestionably discloses\nthat Applicant was financially solvent at all times prior to 2004. All debts alleged in the SOR\nbecame delinquent during about a nine-month period of time in 2004. No debts reflected\nin those credit reports have become delinquent since 2004.\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) in May 2006. He did\nnot disclose any delinquent debts in the e-QIP in response to applicable questions. He\ncredibly testified he was unaware he had any delinquent debts at the time he submitted the\ne-QIP. \nApplicant and his wife purchased a house in 2006. In October 2006, during the\ncourse of closing on the purchase of that house, Applicant learned for the first time of the\nexistence of the delinquent debts. He credibly testified he immediately notified the facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) at his place of employment of the delinquent debts. He also took\nimmediate steps to satisfy the delinquent creditors by signing a contract in November 2006\nwith a consumer credit counseling agency and entering into a repayment plan with that\nagency. The plan purportedly will have all debts fully satisfied within three years of entry\ninto the plan.3\nApplicant has consistently made payments to the credit counseling agency as\nrequired. As of the date of the hearing, all payments into the plan had been used to satisfy\nthe plan\u2019s fees. According to the agreement Applicant entered into with the credit\ncounseling agency, it is only beginning in March 2008 that payments he makes are to be\napplied to satisfy the delinquent debts \nThe contract Applicant has with the credit counseling agency also requires him to\nmake payments into a personal savings accounts that will eventually be used to make\npayments to the creditors. Applicant has regularly made those required payments, although\nthe account is somewhat underfunded due to a withdrawal for an unexpected medical\n\n Applicant testified $1,100 was withdrawn from the account due to the medical emergency and stated\n4\nhe would submit verification of the medical necessity for that withdrawal after the hearing. Post-hearing, he\nsubmitted AE 7 which only discloses a medical payment of $55. However, he explained in AE 6 that $700 had\nbeen set aside for yet unperformed medical work and $374 was used to pay the debt alleged in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.f, and the $700 has been redeposited in the savings accounts as reflected in the savings\ninquiry record included as part of AE 7.  \n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n6\n Department of the Navy v.

Applicant has also taken online consumer counseling courses through the\n4\nconsumer credit counseling service as part of the debt repayment plan.    \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n5\n6\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,7\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n8\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n9\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n10\nclearance decision.11\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n12\n Id at 531.\n13\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n14\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n12\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n13\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n14\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG]) 18\nApplicant allowed a number of debts to become delinquent over the course of a few\nmonths in 2004. Disqualifying Condition DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial\nobligations applies. The delinquencies were not the result of his inability or unwillingness\nto pay his debts, but rather due to a misplaced reliance on his wife doing so as both of\nthem were apparently going through an emotionally upsetting and trying time in their\nmarriage. Thus, DC 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts does not apply to the\nfacts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports establish he led a financially responsible lifestyle at all\ntimes before and after the brief period of time when the debts alleged in the SOR became\ndelinquent because of the turmoil that occurred in his marriage in 2004. He first learned\nof the delinquent debt when he purchased and was closing on a house in October 2006.\nThe following month, a full year before he received the SOR, he entered into a debt\nrepayment plan with a consumer credit counselling agency. Applicant has consistently\nmade the required payments under the plan, made required payments into a personal\nsavings accounts, and taken online consumer credit courses as recommended by the plan.\nAdditionally, he immediately notified his employer\u2019s FSO of the delinquent debts. Mitigating\nConditions (MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 20(b): the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\napply. \n\n6\nAlthough all payments to the plan have thus far been solely applied to pay the credit\ncounseling services fees, Applicant submitted verification he has been enrolled in a 36-\nmonth plan since November 2006 for the specific purpose of settling the debts included in\nthe plan, and, correctly or incorrectly, has been operating under a sincere believe that the\nplan will satisfy all his delinquent creditors within the next two years. Thus, I find Applicant\nis entitled to application of MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG 15\nApplicant submitted an e-QIP in May 2006 in which he failed to disclose the\nexistence of any delinquent debt. He credibly testified he was unaware he had any\ndelinquent debts until he was closing on a house in October 2006, and he immediately\nnotified his employer\u2019s FSO of them when he found about them. Accordingly, no\ndisqualifying condition applies under guideline E.    \n  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has mitigated the alleged financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns. He has overcome the case against\nhim and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guidelines F and E are decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-f:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He admitted he provided some information about his sexual conduct with prostitutes and at massage parlors; however, he denied that on February 9, 2007, he intentionally provided false information to a DoD investigator. He also admitted that on October 6, 2007, he reviewed his February 9, 2007 statement to a DoD investigator; however, he denied that he intentionally failed to correct the false information that was in the statement generated by the DoD investigator.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nFrom 1972 to about 2003 or 2004, Applicant engaged in sexual activity with \nprostitutes. In 2007, he provided false information to a Department of Defense (DoD) \ninvestigator and in his 2007 response to DoD Hearing and Appeals Office (DOHA) \ninterrogatories concerning the recency of his sexual activity with prostitutes. He \nmitigated the security concern under Guideline D because his conduct was not recent; \nhowever, he failed to mitigate security concerns under Guidelines E and J. Access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 25, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 4). \nOn December 31, 2007, the DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines \nNovember 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the DoD \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E \n(Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct) (Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated August 21, 2009, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted: (1) periodically engaging in \nsexual conduct at massage parlors and with prostitutes from 1972 until approximately \n2003; (2) his access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was denied by \nanother agency in 2004; and (3) he failed to fully disclose his sexual conduct to a DoD \ninvestigator in 2007. He admitted he provided some information about his sexual \nconduct with prostitutes and at massage parlors; however, he denied that on February \n9, 2007, he intentionally provided false information to a DoD investigator. He also \nadmitted that on October 6, 2007, he reviewed his February 9, 2007 statement to a DoD \ninvestigator; however, he denied that he intentionally failed to correct the false \ninformation that was in the statement generated by the DoD investigator. He also \nprovided clarifications and explanations about the various SOR subparagraphs, and \nexpressed embarrassment and regret for his conduct (Item 2). After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He is a systems \nsupport engineer. From 1970 to 1979, he served on active duty in the Air Force as an \nenlisted man and then from 1979 to August 2002 as an officer. He retired in the grade of \nLieutenant Colonel. In 2005, he received a master\u2019s degree in communications \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated August 25, 2009, \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated September 4, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 25, 2006, security clearance application (Item 4). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ntechnology. He married in 1973, and he separated from his spouse in 2003. His children \nwere born in 1974 and 1977. \n \nApplicant has never been fired from a job or left employment under adverse \ncircumstances. His file does not contain any adverse information relating to police \ninvolvement. For example, he has never been charged with a felony, any firearms or \nexplosives offense(s), and does not have any currently pending charges. He has never \nbeen charged with any offense related to alcohol or drugs. Hs file does not contain any \ninformation showing he has been arrested for or charged with any other misdemeanor-\nlevel offenses. There is no evidence that he has abused alcohol or drugs. His file does \nnot contain any adverse financial information. \n \nIn 2004, another government agency denied Applicant eligibility for access to SCI \ninformation because he paid prostitutes, escort services, and massage parlors for \nsexual services from 1972 to 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Items 2 at 2, 5). \n  \nSexual Behavior \n  \nApplicant admitted he engaged in sexual conduct with prostitutes and received \nmanual and oral sexual gratification at massage parlors from 1972 to 2003 or 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 2 at 2, 5). He paid prostitutes, escort services, and massage parlors \nand received sexual services (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 2 at 2; 7 at 2). Applicant provided \nspecific information about receiving sexual acts, such as intercourse, as well as manual \nand oral stimulation in exchange for money at massage parlors in three different states \nin 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 (Item 7 at 2-3; Item 8 at 1). He \nengaged in similar conduct in Japan from 1981 to 1986 (Item 7 at 3). He ceased such \nactivities in 2004 (Item 2 at 2). He is ashamed and embarrassed about his sexual \nconduct. He does not intend to resume such sexual activities. Applicant\u2019s wife knows \nabout his extra-marital sexual activities (Item 5 at 6). \n \nFalse statements \n \nOn February 9, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nasked Applicant about sexual activity outside of his marriage. DoD sought such \ninformation for the purpose of determining whether he should have access to classified \ninformation (Item 5 at 8). The OPM investigator described Applicant\u2018s disclosure as \nfollows: \n \nHe answered yes to having engaged in sexual activity outside of marriage. \nFurther questioning revealed that he routinely engaged in extra-marital \nsexual activities with prostitutes. From 1972 to 1986, while he was \nmarried, he sought out prostitutes and paid for sex. He engaged in this \nbehavior wherever he was stationed in the U.S. or outside the country in \nJapan.   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHe does not recall how often he did this or what he paid. He does not \nrecall the exact locations of these activities, but recalls generally \nprostitutes could be found in alleys so he walked the back alleys, once or \ntwice a month, looking for prostitutes. He engaged in this behavior \nbecause he had a strong sexual appetite and liked the excitement. \n \nHe was never arrested because of this activity and he never had any \nencounter of any kind with law enforcement because of this activity. He \nhas not engaged in this activity since 1986. He has no intention of doing it \nin the future. Based on their evaluation of the polygraph, and the admitted \npast activity, [the other agency] would not grant him an SCI clearance.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s February 9, 2007, statement to an OPM investigator (emphasis added).  \n \nDOHA sent Applicant interrogatories and a copy of his February 9, 2007 OPM \nsubject interview and asked him to authenticate or provide corrections to this OPM \nsubject interview. Applicant provided a seven-page typed discussion of the OPM subject \ninterview as part of his response to interrogatories. The discussion included numerous \ncorrections and clarifications, including spelling, dates, locations, names, and the \ncontext of his actions. On October 6, 2007, he swore his responses to the \ninterrogatories were true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. In regard \nto the above three paragraphs, he quoted the OPM summary and then provided \ndetailed commentary. He stated: \n \n.  .  .  Although I did engage in extramarital sexual encounters, I do not \nconsider it \u201croutinely.\u201d The \u201cprostitutes\u201d I referred to were employees at \nmassage parlors who offered extra services, in which I frequently \naccepted in exchange for a monetary tip. I did not engage in this behavior \n\u201cwherever he was stationed.\u201d I do admit engaging in that immoral behavior \nmany times [because] it was available.  \n \nI was very embarrassed to admit these activities to the interviewer, but \ntried to provide accurate information as I remembered. When I said that \n\u201cprostitutes could be found in alleys .  .  .  .\u201d I was referring to my first \noverseas assignment to Taiwan from 1972 to 1973. During breaks from \nwork, several friends and I would \u201cbar hop\u201d in Taipei, Taiwan. As we \ntraveled from bar to bar, street walkers (prostitutes) would proposition us \nfor sex in exchange for money. When we accepted, the ladies would take \nus to a building in the alley, usually where they lived, where the deed was \nperformed. The report makes it sound like I walked through alleys looking \nfor prostitutes. That is not accurate.  .  .  . \n \nHe did not include a correction of his statement to the OPM investigator that he \n\u201chas not engaged in this activity since 1986\u201d in his response to DOHA interrogatories. \nOn October 6, 2007, he signed his explanatory statement. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAs indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s January 18, 2008 SOR response admits that \nhe engaged in sexual activity with women from escort services and/or visited massage \nparlors from 1972 until approximately 2003 or 2004 (Item 2). He explained that he failed \nto disclose his sexual activities after 1986 to the OPM investigator because he \u201cwas \nembarrassed and did not want to recall those times [he] was not proud of.\u201d (Item 2). His \nSOR response admits that his response to DOHA interrogatories failed to correct the \nmisstatement in the OPM interview.     \n       \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E (Personal Conduct), and J \n(Criminal Conduct).  \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior stating: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted that he engaged in sexual conduct with women employed by \nescort services and massage parlors for money on numerous occasions from 1972 to \n2003 or 2004. He engaged in this conduct in several states (not Nevada) and overseas. \nHis conduct in the United States was of a criminal nature. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d) apply. \n \nAlthough he was ashamed of his behavior, he is not vulnerable to coercion \nbecause security personnel and others, including his wife, are well aware of his \nconduct. He stopped his illegal sexual behavior in 2003 or 2004. There is no evidence \nthat he has a personality disorder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and 13(c) do not apply.     \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) apply. His sexual behavior is a misdemeanor-level \ncriminal offense. He stopped engaging in this sexual misconduct in 2003 or 2004. He is \nunlikely to continue to engage in such conduct. Security officials and others are well \naware of his sexual offenses. Accordingly, the sexual behavior no longer serves as a \nbasis for coercion, exploitation or duress.  \n \nThe other mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant committed the sexual \nbehavior at issue, and the conduct continued until he was in his 50s. AG \u00b6 14(a) does \nnot apply because he was not an adolescent. He did not carry his burden of establishing \nthe conduct was strictly private, consensual, and discreet. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the \nadjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.4 \n \nOn February 9, 2007, Applicant deliberately made a false statement to an OPM \ninvestigator, when he said he ended his sexual activity with prostitutes and employees \nof escort services and massage parlors in 1986. On October 6, 2007, in response to a \nDOHA interrogatory, he made a false sworn statement when he acknowledged his \nFebruary 9, 2007 OPM statement was accurate with respect to ending his sexual \nactivity with prostitutes and employees of escort services and massage parlors in 1986. \nHe actually continued to pay women to engage in such sexual activity with him until \n2003 or 2004.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n \n4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s false \nstatements cannot be mitigated at this time because they are too serious and too \nrecent.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d SOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmaking two false statements on February 9, 2007 to an OPM investigator and on \nOctober 6, 2007 in response to DOHA interrogatories. Although he said he provided \nfalse information to DoD because of his embarrassment, I conclude that he recognized \nthat his revelations about sexual misconduct resulted in the other agency\u2019s denial of his \nclearance, and he deliberately provided false information about the recency of his \nsexual misconduct in an attempt to obtain a security clearance from DoD under false \npretenses.    \n \nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995), as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of \ninfluencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States \nv. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers to the OPM investigator and in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories about ending his sexual activity with prostitutes, and \nemployees of escort services and massage parlors in 2003 or 2004, his accurate \nanswers were capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His \nthirty years of sexual misbehavior, including numerous misdemeanor-level crimes up to \n2003 or 2004, caused another agency to revoke his security clearance. In 2007, his \nsexual misbehavior was still sufficiently recent, derogatory information5 which \nreasonably could have jeopardized approval of his security clearance. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential \nsentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). Accordingly, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and 31(c) apply because Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n5 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nNone of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 fully apply. Applicant\u2019s false \nstatements occurred in 2007, which is somewhat recent. It casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced \ninto making his false statements.  His false statements are substantiated.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding the passage of about two years since his false statements without additional \ncriminal activity. Although he expressed his remorse, embarrassment, and shame for \nhis sexual conduct, he denied that he deliberately and intentionally provided false \ninformation. He has not accepted responsibility for his two false statements in 2007. He \nhas received some job training, and has an outstanding employment record serving in \nthe Air Force. However, his post-offense behavior is insufficient to fully mitigate the very \nserious misconduct in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D, E, and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. He has not committed any sexual offenses since 2003 or 2004. The sexual \noffenses occurring in the United States are misdemeanor-level offenses involving his \npayments for sexual acts as opposed to felony-level crimes. He served on active duty \nmore than 30 years and retired from the Air Force in the grade of Lieutenant Colonel. \nApplicant significantly contributed to the national defense over his lengthy career. There \nis no evidence of any disciplinary problems at work. There is no evidence of drug or \nalcohol abuse. There is no evidence of disloyalty. There is no evidence that he would \nintentionally violate national security, or that he would fail to safeguard sensitive or \nclassified information. His character and good work performance show substantial \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.    \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nBecause of his background, military experience, and years of holding a high-level \nsecurity clearance, Applicant was well aware of the importance of providing accurate \ninformation in the context of evaluating and retaining a security clearance. After another \nfederal agency revoked his security clearance because of his sexual conduct with \nprostitutes and employees of escort services and massage parlors, Applicant was on \nnotice that DoD might deny his clearance, if he revealed that his sexual indiscretions \ncontinued until 2003 or 2004. In 2007, he intentionally lied to an OPM investigator and \nfalsely claimed that he stopped his sexual indiscretions in 1986. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, he failed to correct his false claim to the OPM investigator that he ended \nhis inappropriate sexual conduct in 1986, which was about 21 years earlier. When he \nresponded to the SOR, he failed to take full responsibility for his attempts in 2007 to \ndeceive the DoD. His two false statements in 2007 are felonies because they violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and cannot be mitigated at this time. His two false statements in 2007 \nwere knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. These two crimes show lack of judgment and a failure to \nabide by the law. Such conduct establishes a serious security concern, and access to \nclassified information is not warranted at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal \nconduct and personal conduct. His sexual behavior is mitigated because it ended in \n2003 or 2004, and it is not recent.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n6See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 24,\n2005. On February 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 14, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 7, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-7), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE A-N), without objection. I left the record open until\nMay 27, 2008 for Applicant to submit additional documentation. He did not submit any\nJune 9, 2008\n\n2\ndocuments. The record closed on May 21, 2008. DOHA received the transcript on May\n16, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 19, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d of the SOR. He also admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.h of the SOR but denied the other allegations (2.a and 2.b)\nbecause the debts were paid or he had no knowledge of them. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He received his\nGED in 1974. In 1978, he attended a community college. He has worked for his current\nemployer since May 2004 (GE 1). Applicant served in the national guard in 1979 to\n1980. \nWhen Applicant was a young man, he had several arrests. In February 1968, he\nwas arrested and charged with statutory rape (GE 4). He was dating a girl who was 13\nyears old. He was 17 years old. Her parents pressed charges against Applicant (Tr. 46).\nApplicant believes they appeared in court and were then sent home. He does not recall.\nHe did not learn that the charge was for statutory rape until 2005.\nIn May 1968, Applicant was arrested and charged with destroying property.\nApplicant stated that he broke into a drink machine. He was jailed for 90 days. In August\n1968, Applicant robbed a man. He had a gun (.22 calbier revolver) at the time. Applicant\nclaims that the gun did not work (Tr. 49). He was found guilty and sentenced to five\nyears and actually imprisoned for 30 months (GE 4).\nApplicant married in 1972 and divorced his first wife in 1985. He had three\nchildren from his first marriage (Tr. 39). Applicant remarried in 1988. He and his second\nwife have five children. He paid child support for his three children after the divorce. (Tr\n55). He fell behind in his payments of $125 a week. The current balance is $3000 as of\nMarch 2008. The deduction of $57.50 is made from his weekly paycheck (Tr 74). \nAfter Applicant left the national guard in 1980, he worked as an electrician. He\nwas steadily employed until 1994. In 1994, Applicant had neck surgery and was\nunemployed for almost one year. In 1995, Applicant had a stroke. He remained in\nintensive care for a period of time.  After about five months, he returned to his job (Tr.\n42). Despite the fact that he had health insurance, Applicant began to experience\nfinancial difficulties. He received worker\u2019s compensation but the income was not\nsufficient to pay his child support obligation of $125 a week and pay for his living\nexpenses. Thus, he fell behind in the child support obligations (GE 6).\nIn March 2005, Applicant and his sons were hunting. Applicant uses a bow and\narrow. His friends use shotguns. He had their guns in his truck. The game warden\n\n3\nadvised Applicant that he could not have the guns in his possession because he was a\nconvicted felon. Applicant turned himself in for the firearm charge and he was released\non bond after going to court. The charge was dismissed. (GE4; Tr. 51).\nApplicant was diagnosed with cancer in 2005. He had surgery and was treated\nfor at least a five-month period. He could not work during the treatment (Tr. 56). In\nMarch 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (GE 4). On June 24, 2005, the\nbankruptcy was discharged. He had approximately $51,000 in liabilities. \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, including one child support obligation,\na bankruptcy, a charged off account and approximately four unpaid medical debts. The\ntotal amount of the unpaid medical bills is approximately $600 (GE 7).\nSOR allegation 2.a is for a charged off account in the amount of $11,584. This\naccount opened in 1999 appears to be the same account that was discharged in the\nbankruptcy petition under another account name (GE 2). Applicant was adamant that\nhis attorney advised him that all his delinquent accounts, except child support, were\nincluded in his March 2005 bankruptcy.\nSOR 2.b is a telephone bill for $97 that Applicant has paid. He did not have\ndocumentation at the hearing. He initially disputed the bill because the phone service\nwas not adequate and he cancelled the plan. He sent them a check recently (Tr. 65).\nSOR 2.c-2.f are unpaid medical bills from late 2006. They total approximately\n$600. Applicant has paid many medical bills. He is not certain if his insurance paid some\nof the bills. He pays what he can when he receives a bill (Tr. 66).\nSOR allegation 2.g is for past due child support (interest only). Applicant has\nbeen paying and the amount has been reduced from $5,109 to $3,121.79. The amount\nof approximately $58 is taken directly from his weekly pay check (AE N). The children\nare emancipated at this point in time.\nSOR allegation 2.h is for the bankruptcy that Applicant filed in 2005. This chapter\nseven bankruptcy was discharged in June 2005 (GE 2). The liabilities resulted from\nApplicant\u2019s divorce, illnesses and unemployment.\n .\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $4,000. His wife also works. After\nmonthly expenses and child support and current debt payments, he has a net remainder\nof $600. Applicant\u2019s truck loan and credit card debt are current. He received financial\ncounseling in 2005 when he filed for bankruptcy. He has an established budget now (Tr.\n79). \nApplicant\u2019s current employer recommends Applicant for a security clearance. He\nreports Applicant plays a vital role in the timely quality and construction of the most\nadvanced combatants in the world (AE G). He has served his department with integrity\nand possesses excellent mechanic skills. He has provided dedicated supervisory\n\n4\nresponsibilities and displayed outstanding supervisory skills and dedication. He tackles\nevery assignment with a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude (AE H). Applicant is well respected by his co-\nworkers (AE I). He is a hard worker and is knowledgeable of submarine work. He has\nacted in the capacity of a make-up foreman on several occasions and has performed\nwell (AE K). He works in a focused, timely, and concise manner. He works any shift or\nassignment that he is given without hesitation (AE A). He is receptive to management\nstyle and is quick to learn new systems. He is an extremely valuable and dedicated\nemployee (AE B, C and D). During his current employment, Applicant has completed\nmany courses and attained proficiency in different operational areas (AE M).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n5\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\ncould not meet his financial obligations from the late 1990's. He filed for bankruptcy in\n2005. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries arose in 1995. He accumulated some delinquent debt due\nto his medical conditions and unemployment. He also fell behind in his child support\nobligations. While those circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does\nnot end at that point. He did pay the medical bills that he could and had been paying his\nchild support. Because of his dedicated recent efforts to establish financial\nresponsibility, it is unlikely that the financial difficulties will recur or that there is any\ndoubt about his current reliability or good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition\napplies. \n\n6\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems initially arose from his illness, divorce, and a period of\nunemployment. Although, he received worker\u2019s compensation benefits, those benefits\nwere not adequate for him to maintain payments on his debts. After he became re-\nemployed, he acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this\npotentially mitigating condition fully applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This fully applies. Similarly, AG & 20(d)\napplies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received counseling when he\nfiled for bankruptcy in March 2005. This is a legitimate means to resolve financial\ndifficulties. In this case many of the financial problems were caused by his various\nillnesses and not frivolous spending. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition\npartially applies to SOR 2.d.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebt in allegation 2.a for $11,000 was included in the bankruptcy petition. The date in\nthe SOR for this debt predates the 2005 bankruptcy discharge. He disputed the account\nand although he did not have separate documentation, the account appears to be the\nsame one as listed in a schedule of the petition. I conclude this potentially mitigating\ncondition partially applies.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 31(a), an \u201csingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG 31(c) an allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant has two convictions from the 1960's.\nThe 2005 charge was dismissed. This is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or\nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d is a possible\nmitigating condition.\nApplicant\u2019s two convictions occurred about 40 years ago. His recent (2005)\nincident involved the physical possession of firearms in his truck during a hunting trip.\nThe guns did not belong to him, but he was in actual possession of them in his truck.\nThis mitigating condition applies because of the unusual circumstances of the offenses\nin the 1960's, and he will not permit firearms in his truck in the future.\nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 32(c) \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\u201d is a possible mitigating condition.\nApplicant has not been involved in a serious crime in 40 years. However, the\n2005 incident shows poor judgment. The charge was dismissed in court. Applicant was\ncredible in that he did not understand that he could be in possession of the guns\nbecause they did not belong to him. He has worked steadily for the past 40 years\nexcept for a period of recuperation from surgery or illness. He raised his family and until\n1995 was current on his child support. He has highly favorable recommendations from\nhis employer. He has taken many courses to improve his work skills. He regrets his\nbehavior when he was a very young man. This mitigating condition partially applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant was 17 years old when he had trouble with\nthe law. He served his sentence and has not been convicted of any crime in the past 40\nyears.\n\n8\nDue to illness and unemployment, Applicant had financial difficulties. He fell\nbehind in his child support but is now steadily paying the amount. He has $57.50\ndeducted from his weekly pay check. His children are now grown. Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy in March 2005 and his debts were discharged the same year.\nThis is a legal means of resolving debt.\nApplicant has taken his work seriously. He has completed many courses during\nhis employment so that he may better perform his job functions. He has worked hard to\nsupport his family and children. His employers have recommended him highly. He has\nhad no documented problems with any of his employers. His current employer praises\nhis hard work and professionalism. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On November 3, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant offers new evidence in the form an explanation as to the circumstances\n1\nsurrounding his preparation of his eQIP.  The Board may not consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On March\n6, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which he asserts shows that he now has\nan adequate plan for resolving his financial problems.  He also argues that there is no danger that he\nwill disclose sensitive information, and that his failure to list five unpaid debts on his Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (eQIP) was the result of a mistake, not a deliberate\nfalsification.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish the Judge erred.   \n1\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the falsification of his (eQIP) without\nexplanation. He elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record, and in his\nrespond to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) offered no explanation for the\nomissions.  As a result, the Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about the omissions\nand evaluate his credibility in the context of a hearing.  Given the limited record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable, and his ultimate unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1;\nISCR Case No. 06-26061 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008). \nWith respect to the Guideline F allegations, the Judge made sustainable findings that\nApplicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case\nwas submitted for decision, Applicant still had a significant amount of overdue indebtedness that he\nwas trying to clear up, and had only recently been accepted into a credit card assistance program.\n\n3\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that: \u201c[i]t is too early in the process\nto know if Applicant will adhere to the program.  There are not yet clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Decision at 6.\nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to several of the SOR allegations.\nHowever, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the falsification of his \nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions and by his history of not meeting his financial \nobligations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn November 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nF, Financial Considerations and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 6, 2007, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on January 10, 2008. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on January 22, 2008, and responded \nin an undated response with two attached letters. Department Counsel did not object to \nApplicant\u2019s response. I received the case assignment on February 27, 2008. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse contained an ambiguous reference to a hearing. I asked Department Counsel \nto contact Applicant to ensure that he wanted his case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. Applicant replied with a fax letter on February 28, 2008, certifying that \nhe did not want a hearing. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following \nallegation:  \n \n1.m. You are indebted to [creditor] for a delinquent account that has been \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $1,115. As of November 7, \n2006, this debt had not been paid. \n \nTwo credit reports were submitted as evidence. The credit report of November 7, \n2006, lists the above debt and shows \u201caccount transferred to another office,\u201d and \n\u201c$1115 CHG-OFF.\u201d However, it does not show a balance. The credit report of August \n15, 2007, shows the above debt as \u201caccount transferred or sold\u201d and lists a balance of \nzero. It is unclear who the debt was transferred to or the current status of the debt. I do \nnot find that the requested amendment is in conformity with the evidence admitted. The \nmotion to amend the SOR is denied.1  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 6, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR, but indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k were \nduplicates. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility \nfor a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. His education is not \nlisted in the FORM. Applicant served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1985 to 1993 and \nactive duty Army from 1993 to 1999. He was honorably discharged as a Sergeant (E-5). \nApplicant is married and has two stepchildren, ages 25 and 18.2  \n                                                          \n1 If the motion had been granted, the allegation would have been concluded in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n2 Item 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant has an extensive amount of delinquent debt. He was married in 2003. \nHe and his wife accepted offers for credit cards. They wanted to purchase a house and \nthought that using the credit cards would help them build their credit and would assist \nthem in obtaining a mortgage. Applicant admitted that they \u201cmessed up and received \ntoo much credit and used the credit wrongly.\u201d He stated that after \u201ctrying to make the \npayments [they] fell behind and the service charges and late fees were more than [they] \ncould handle.\u201d3  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 12 debts totaling approximately $18,254. Applicant admitted all the \ndebts listed in the SOR, but indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k were \nduplicates. SOR \u00b6 1.a lists an unpaid judgment of $569, awarded in July 2006 to a \ncollection company.  SOR \u00b6 1.k lists a delinquent debt of $569 owed to a different \ncollection company on behalf of a financial institution. After reviewing the evidence, I \nfind they represent the same debt. After that duplication is eliminated, 11 debts remain, \ntotaling approximately $17,685. The credit reports in the FORM corroborate the debts.4 \nThere is no evidence that any of the debts have been paid.  \n \n \nApplicant started talking with a credit card assistance program in October 2007. \nHe was accepted into the program in December 2007. The company will negotiate with \nApplicant\u2019s creditors on his behalf. His monthly allocation into the program is $337, \nwhich will disburse the funds to Applicant\u2019s creditors.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), signed and \ncertified as true on October 20, 2006. Applicant answered \u201cNO\u2019\u201d to all the pertinent \nfinancial questions on the SF 86, including Questions 27D, 28A, and 28B. Question 27D \nasked, \u201cLast 7 yrs, judgements not paid?\u201d Question 28A asked, \u201cLast 7 yrs, over 180 \ndays delinquent on any debts?\u201d Question 28B asked, \u201cCurrently over 90 days \ndelinquent on any debts?\u201d Applicant admitted the three falsification allegations in the \nSOR. An admission to a falsification allegation is not absolutely binding on an \nAdministrative Judge, particularly where there is an additional explanation that serves to \nundercut the admission.6 In this case there are no additional explanations in Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR, only the words \u201cI admit.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s written argument \nin the FORM states that Applicant \u201cdeliberately\u201d falsified material facts on the \nquestionnaire. When Applicant submitted his response to the FORM, he discussed his \nfinances in some detail. He did not discuss the questionnaire at all, but he stated that he \nhad no idea his \u201ccredit was so bad and was so delinquent.\u201d He also stated that he and \nhis wife \u201cstarted this process in October and received a credit report in November and \nrealized how horribly bad [they] had failed.\u201d7  \n                                                          \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n4 Items 5 and 6. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-21087 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2005). \n \n7 Item 4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted the SF 86 in October 2006. He had a number of debts that \nwere placed for collection well before the SF 86 was submitted. After considering all the \nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his responses to the SOR and the FORM, \nI find Applicant knew he had delinquent debts when be submitted the SF 86, and that he \nintentionally falsified Questions 28A and 28B. I do not find sufficient evidence that \nApplicant was aware of the judgment awarded against him or that he intentionally \nfalsified Question 27D. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he was ashamed and embarrassed that this has happened. \nHe has never been arrested and he has a perfect driving record.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for some time. He admitted that he and his wife used credit cards \nexcessively and were unable to pay them. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant currently has delinquent debt totaling more than $17,000. His overall \nconduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He and his wife used credit cards and \nspent more than they could afford to pay. That does not qualify as a condition that was \nlargely beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. Applicant was accepted in a \ncredit card assistance program in December 2007. It is too early in the process to know \nif Applicant will adhere to the program. There are not yet clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. \nApplicant has not yet done enough to show a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k \nare duplicates. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.k.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n           The intentional falsification of Applicant\u2019s SF 86 in October 2006, raises AG \u00b6 \n16(a).  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and the individual \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \n \nI have considered all the potential mitigating conditions. Applicant submitted his \nSF 86 in October 2006. He deliberately failed to disclose significant delinquent debt. \nApplicant has not submitted sufficient credible information to establish any of the \nmitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served honorably in the \nU.S. Army. He has clean criminal and driving records. However, he has a history of \nshirking his financial responsibilities, and he intentionally provided false information on \nhis security clearance questionnaire.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on his financial issues and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on March 18, 2008, Applicant admitted five of six\nallegations raised regarding five delinquent accounts; she denied the sixth allegation\nonly with regard to the balance cited. The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant agreed to a May 28, 2008, hearing date and a\nNotice of Hearing was issued on May 13, 2008.\nJuly 15, 2008\n\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits\n(Ex.), which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted nine exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-I without objection. Applicant gave\ntestimony and no witnesses were called. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 5,\n2008. Four additional documents were received from Applicant on June 6, 2008, and\naccepted into the record as Exs. J-M. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits,\nand testimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 24-year-old casualty specialist working for a defense contractor.\nShe has worked for that employer since October 2004. Prior to that, she was a student\nintern with a Federal agency. She is currently on a break from college, where she has\ncompleted her freshman year of studies toward an education major. She is a single\nmother and the sole support of a six-year-old son.\nIn February 2001, Applicant was hired as a student clerk for a Federal agency.\nWorking approximately 20 hours per week, she earned about $800 a month. The\nfollowing year, in February 2002, she gave birth to her son. The two lived with her\nparents and young brother to reduce costs. Due to the child\u2019s birth, Appellant decided\nto defer her plans to continue in college.\nThe child suffered from severe asthma in his first years, necessitating many\ndoctor and hospital visits and resulting in many medical bills. Applicant\u2019s internship did\nnot provide her with health insurance, so only Medicaid helped pay for the child\u2019s\nmedical care. As the child grew older and his asthma grew less threatening, Applicant\u2019s\nmother\u2019s health started to decline. Applicant became her primary care-giver and helps\noversee her brother while her father works. She has twice been hospitalized for months\nat a time, setting Applicant back in terms of her work load and her ability to pay off bills.\nHer mother\u2019s first illness occurred shortly after Applicant returned to college in 2003. \nApplicant quit school to care for her mother. She left school, however, after the\ncut-off date for receiving a refund on her semester\u2019s tuition. Her subsequent withdrawal\nfrom school accelerated the due date on her student loans and she was soon in default\non those loans. Those payments joined others she could not afford when she was\nforced to quit her part-time job to care for her family. \nBy mid-2004, Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s asthma had improved and her mother\u2019s health\nwas better. She accepted her current job in October 2004. With a steady job, Applicant\nbegan to address her many extraneous debts. She tried to pay her current obligations\nfirst, then pay off her delinquent debts from oldest to most recent. Many were relatively\nminor medical accounts. Her student loans were an obstacle because the balance was\noverwhelming and demanded it be addressed through an organized plan. Applicant\n\n Tr. 49.\n1\n See Ex. B (Payment to current debt collector on account cited in SOR allegation 1.a.).\n2\n Ex. C (Proof of payment by debit on May 27, 2008).  \n3\n Tr. 31.\n4\n Ex. E (Credit report, dated May 28, 2008, showing all the major credit reporting bureaus now reflect this\n5\naccount as paid).\n Ex. 4 (Credit report, dated April 10, 2008); compare Ex. 3 (Credit report, dated November 11, 2007) and Ex.\n6\n2 (Credit report, dated November 18, 2006).\n3\nnow recognizes she should have approached the debts differently.  By the time she\n1\nreceived the SOR in early 2008, however, she was making progress on those old\nobligations. At issue in the SOR are six obligations. \n1) COLLECTION ACTION FOR $548 \u2013 Balance cited in SOR paid \u2013 This balance was\nplaced for collection in April 2003. The collection agent noted in the SOR was\nsucceeded by a subsequent collection agent. On May 23, 2008, the latter agent was\nauthorized to withdraw $581.14 from Applicant\u2019s bank account.  The withdrawal cleared\n2\nand was posted on Applicant\u2019s bank statement on May 27, 2008.  \n3\n2) MEDICAL DEBT FOR $80 \u2013 Balance cited in SOR paid \u2013 This balance for allegedly\nfailing to keep a medical appointment was initially disputed by Applicant, who maintains\nshe gave adequate cancellation notice.  It was placed in collection in approximately\n4\nMay 2005. Applicant settled the matter with a payment of $83.80 to a local medical\npractitioner. Despite the Government\u2019s use of a particular credit reporting bureau that\nirregularly provides complete account data, the weight of the evidence supports that this\naccount is the one at issue in the SOR.\n3) MEDICAL DEBT FOR $429 \u2013 Balance cited in SOR paid \u2013 This balance represents\na number of charges related to Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s 2007 emergency hospital care. It was\npaid along with a number of other charges, so Applicant does not have a receipt of\npayment. She demonstrated, however, that her most recent credit report from May\n2008 indicates that the account has been paid.5\n4) MEDICAL DEBT FOR $117 \u2013 Balance cited in SOR paid \u2013 This balance was placed\nfor collection in September 2005 with a date of last activity in January 2006. Applicant\npreviously paid this emergency care bill, but failed to keep a receipt. She disputed its\ninclusion on her credit report. The Government\u2019s April 10, 2008, does not list the\naccount. The entry was apparently deleted.  Inasmuch as only a little more than two\n6\nyears passed between the date the account was opened and the date of last activity\nbefore it was removed, it was not deleted as stale. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to\nconclude that the account was previously satisfied.  \n\n Ex. F (Credit network receipt, dated April 18, 2008) and Ex. E (Credit report, dated May 28, 2008, showing\n7\ntwo of the three major credit reporting bureaus now reflect this account as paid).\n See Tr. 33-34; Ex. I (Agreement confirmation, dated September 28, 2007); Ex. G (Authorization to withdraw\n8\nfunds automatically, dated May 17, 2008); Ex. H (Payment schedule).\n Tr. 34.\n9\n Id.\n10\n Ex. G., supra, note 6.\n11\n Tr. 36-37; Ex. L (Repayment of one extraneous obligation) and Ex. M (Repayment plan disbursements).\n12\nSome of these debts are medical and related to her son; they have since been paid. Tr. 44-45.\n Tr. 50.\n13\n4\n5) MEDICAL DEBT FOR $93 \u2013 Balance cited in SOR paid \u2013 This balance was placed\nfor collection in November 2005 with a specific collection agency. Applicant showed she\npaid that agency $192.54 for service provided in April 2005 on April 18, 2008, with a\nreceipt of payment and evidence that payment has thus far been reflected on two of the\nthree major credit reporting bureaus.7\n6) STUDENT LOANS FOR $16,737 \u2013 In repayment \u2013 Applicant denied the allegation\nregarding these two loans, but only with regard to the total balance represented. She\nadmits the student loans became delinquent. She intended to return to school after her\nbaby was born and assumed the loan proceeds could be deferred. As previously noted,\nhowever, she was forced to drop out of school shortly after she recommenced her\nprogram to care for her mother. She departed after the last day to drop a class with a\nrefund of tuition, so the proceeds went to the school and the obligation was created for\nApplicant. To remedy the situation, she joined the lender\u2019s rehabilitation program. \nUnder that program she paid an initial percentage of her total balance ($886) to\nget into the program and had to pay $152 per month for nine months.  After nine\n8\nmonths of timely payment, the lender checks that these payments were timely made,\nreestablishes the loans, designates the loans as current, and makes one eligible to\ncontinue receiving student loans.  Applicant has complied with the terms of that\n9\nagreement. She authorized timely withdrawals from her checking account to pay her\nmonthly payments and her last payment was due June 26, 2008.  As of May 17, 2008,\n10\nthe balance was reduced to $16,310.35.11\nToday, Applicant is doing well financially. She addressed the above-cited\ndelinquent debts in a quick and decisive manner without hardship. She has a few other\npast debts which were not noted in the SOR that are subject to a reasonable debt\nconsolidation plan.  She continues to be timely on all current obligations. She lives\n12\nfrugally at home with her parents, where she contributes to the household by paying\nutilities, cable, and groceries. She anticipates continuing with her care of her parents\nand staying with them for the time being.  She enjoys her simple lifestyle, her family,\n13\n\n Id.\n14\n Tr. 52.\n15\n Tr. 53.\n16\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n17\n Department of the Navy v.

She\n14\nhas received financial counseling, now understands a budget, and is in a better position\nto handle her own finances and handle her current salary. Her net remainder each\nmonth is now in the surplus due to increased salary and debt elimination. After all\nexpenses, she has about $250 per month in excess funds. From that amount, some\nmoney is set aside for her son\u2019s future. She contributes to a 401(k) through direct\ndeduction. She hopes to return to college in the fall of 2008 through grants.  A return to\n15\ncollege would revert her now current student loans to deferred status.16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n17\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n18\n19\n\n Id.\n20\n Id.\n21\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n23\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n20\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n21\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n22\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n23\nunder this guideline.  \nBetween the time Applicant became a single, teenage mother in 2002 and the\ntime she started her current work in 2005, she provided financial, emotional, and\n\n7\nphysical care for her son and mother as they endured a series of illnesses. In the\nprocess, work hours were missed, obligations incurred, and debts became delinquent.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nAppellant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nWhen Applicant found herself a single mother at age 18, it impacted both her\ncollegiate studies and her employment as a student intern. Her hours away from home\nhad to be reduced and her income was impacted. Her son\u2019s severe asthma required\nextraordinary medical attention, then her mother\u2019s sudden illnesses demanded her\npersonal and financial assistance. Indeed, the confluence of those two illnesses forced\nher to withdraw from college after the last date to receive a tuition refund, thus\nobligating her in full for the cost of a school year she would not complete. Given this\nchain of unforeseeable events within a relatively brief period and the economic\nrepercussions its posed, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6\n20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances) applies.\nAll of the debts at issue arose from her son\u2019s early childhood asthma and the\nfamily illnesses that would force her to withdraw from school after the last date to\nwithdraw without sacrificing her student loan tuition disbursement in 2003-2004. The\nfinancial repercussions were mostly the result of ill health and ill timing beyond her\ncontrol and unlikely to recur. She cannot be faulted for making sure her son and her\nmother received appropriate medical care or her personal attendance during a period of\nhealth crisis. Given these factors, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) 1, AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Once she\ndiscovered the existence and extent of her delinquent obligations, she began\naddressing them. Given the extensive medical care her son required, the amount that\nwent delinquent and is at issue here (about $600) is relatively minor, appears to have\ngone unpaid due to oversight, and has since been paid. She successfully proceeded to\nrehabilitate her student loans as a major step toward rectifying her financial situation\nand resuming her studies this autumn. While such action may have been taken to\nretain her security clearance eligibility, as suggested by Government counsel, the\nevidence indicates that there were other, equally valid reasons for her addressing that\napproximately $16,000 sum. Regardless, all the accounts at issue have been\naddressed. FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nWhen Applicant first encountered financial problems, she was a teenager, a new\nmother with only a high school diploma. Her initial approach to her debts was somewhat\nhaphazard. She has since received financial counseling and, based on her testimony,\nApplicant now demonstrates a superior understanding of her own finances. She has\n\n Tr. 47. Counsel continued by noting:  \u201cthe only remaining concern . . . is the order in which these debts were\n24\naddressed and it was after the SOR was issued and whether or not it was a true effort to become current with\ndebts or rather an effort to just obtain a security clearance.\u201d Tr. 47-48.\n8\nalso demonstrated that all but one of the debts cited has been satisfied. As for the\nremaining obligation, it is in repayment. Therefore, FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies. In light of all\nthe facts presented and the persuasive applicability of these mitigating conditions, I\nconclude Appellant has mitigated financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible young woman. She gave forthright testimony regarding\nher family and her personal growth from student intern to professional working mother.\nShe had the acuity to balance her work with her parental obligations while also assisting\nher parents. She learned to enjoy a simple lifestyle while rising in the business world.\nShe has received financial counseling, developed a budget, addressed the accounts at\nissue, and demonstrated how she has handled some other extraneous debts in a\nmature manner.\nApplicant has paid the delinquent medical bills cited. Although the student loans\nbalances are still outstanding, the facts giving rise to their acceleration are unique.\nMoreover, they are now in repayment. Thus rehabilitated, Applicant has honored her\nobligation and opened a way for her to return to college with financial assistance. To\nquote Government counsel, \u201cApplicant has certainly provided a tremendous amount of\nmitigating evidence here relating to situations outside of her control as well as her\nefforts to repay those debts.\u201d  \n24\nFinally, the Government expressed reservations regarding the order in which\nthese debts were addressed and questioned Applicant\u2019s principal motive for addressing\n\n9\nthese obligations was simply to obtain a security clearance. First, Applicant concedes\nshe did not initially approach her debts in the most organized fashion. To fortify what\nshe then lacked in financial savvy, however, Applicant received financial counseling on\nher own initiative that set her on course for addressing her debts in a proper manner.\nToday, she has an understanding of her finances and of credit. Second, while\nrehabilitation of her student loans at this time might help mitigate financial security\nconcerns, there is no basis that she did so simply to obtain a security clearance.\nRather, her main motivation for addressing the loans at this time seems to be her desire\nto return to finish college. Third, through her credible testimony and actions, Applicant\nhas demonstrated that she has matured into a responsible young woman with\ndemonstrated priorities and a sense of obligation with regard to her finances. With\nsecurity concerns mitigated and these reservations addressed, I conclude it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ngranted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch\nJuly 3, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 30,\n2006. On February 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on February 28, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 8, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on April 29, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 8,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibits A through I, without objection. Four additional witnesses testified on\nbehalf of Applicant. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 9, 2008.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand the additional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. She is currently remarried, and she has one son. She\nreceived a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Natural Science. \nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists four allegations regarding overdue debts under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\nApplicant testified that these debts were incurred for an individual (Mr. A), who\nwas very ill with Spina Bifida, and for whom Applicant\u2019s mother was acting as a\nguardian. Although this individual had monetary assets, he did not have the credit\nhistory to apply for the loans, upon which all four debts (1.a. through 1.d.) were based.\nTherefore, Applicant\u2019s mother asked Applicant to be a co-signer or signer for each of\nthese debts. It was Applicant\u2019s understanding that these debts would be repaid through\nthe estate of Mr. A, since the debts were incurred for his benefit, and that she would not\nbe responsible for repaying these debts. However, since Mr. A died within one year\nafter the purchasing of the items that are the subject of this SOR, and there was a will\ndispute, the debts were delayed in being paid. \n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,302.\nApplicant testified that this debt was taken out for a loan to purchase an automobile at\nthe request of the guardian for the benefit of Mr. A, not for Applicant who had her own\nvehicle. The loan was co-signed with the Applicant and Mr. A. Based on the testimony\nof Applicant\u2019s mother, the car was purchased for approximately $22,000 in 2000, with\n$10,000 being paid as a  down payment. \nBecause Mr. A died less than a year after the vehicle was purchased, the vehicle\nwas returned to the dealer within the first year of its purchase in 2001. Applicant\u2019s\nmother testified that she received documentation showing that the account had been\npaid in full and no further money was due and owing on the vehicle. However, she did\nnot produce any documentation to establish this as she contended that when the estate\nfinally settled in 2005, she discarded or shredded all the documents regarding the\nestate. \n\n3\nApplicant testified that she has attempted to contact the creditor of this account,\nand she has followed the trail of different creditors that purchased the initial creditor\u2019s\ninterest. According to Applicant, the current creditor has no record of this account so\nApplicant has no other means to ascertain the current status of this debt (Tr at 145-\n146). I find that If the vehicle was returned within less than a year after purchase, and a\ndown payment of $10,000 had been made on this vehicle, the assertion that nothing\nremains owing on the vehicle after it had been sold at auction, seems reasonable, and\nthat Applicant has acted responsibly to resolve this debt.  \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,475.\nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred when Applicant\u2019s  mother was purchasing\nfurniture for the home in which Mr. A, Applicant\u2019s mother, Applicant and other care\ngivers for Mr. A were going to live. Since this debt did not need a cosigner, Applicant\nalone signed for this debt, again at the request of Applicant\u2019s mother. Applicant\nintroduced documentation to show that this debt was paid in full as of October 27, 2003\n(Exhibit D). I find that Applicant no longer owes this debt. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,162.\nApplicant no longer owes this debt. Applicant contended that this debt had been signed\nby her for a loan, again at the request of Applicant\u2019s mother when Applicant\u2019s mother\npurchased furniture for the home in which Mr. A and others lived. Applicant introduced\ndocumentation to show that this debt was paid in full as of June 16, 2005 (Exhibit F). I\nfind that Applicant no longer owes this debt. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,880.\nApplicant argued that this debt is the same as that which is listed as 1.c., above, and\nhas been paid in full. Exhibit F shows that this debt is the same as the debt listed to\nCreditor 3 in 1.c. Therefore, I find that this debt is the same as 1.c., above. and has\nbeen resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and Applicant testified that there had been a period of\nestrangement between the two of them beginning in 2001 and lasting for several years.\nThey confirmed that Applicant did request that Applicant\u2019s mother send her\ndocumentation to show that the debts were being paid and remained current.\nApplicant testified that her finances are currently in very good order, and she\ndoes not have any overdue debts. In fact, with the exception of her college student loan,\nfor which she is current, she has no debts. She has only one credit card, and she pays\nthe balance of that each month. Her assets include a 401k account and a savings\naccount. Her current husband is also debt free and has some positive assets. \nApplicant  also offered into evidence the testimony of her father, her mother, and\ntwo individuals who know Applicant in her professional life. Applicant\u2019s father, who is a\nmilitary officer and a physician testified \u201cthat [Applicant] has always worked hard to try to\nmaintain her own good credit - - to pay her own bills, to be responsible for her own\ndebts. . . She has worked hard to , again, follow the principles I tried to instill in her with\nhonest and responsibility.\u201d (Tr at 43).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother confirmed that Applicant signed or cosigned for the debts\nlisted on the SOR at Applicant\u2019s mothers request, and all of the items purchased, the\nvehicle and the furniture, were for the benefit of Mr. A, not for Applicant\u2019s benefit.\nAdditionally, Applicant did continue to follow up with her mother to make sure that all of\nthese debts were properly resolved. \nThe two additional witnesses, who know Applicant primarily in her work setting,\nspoke in extremely laudatory terms of her hard work, high integrity and ability.\nFinally, Applicant submitted 11 awards that she has received from her employer\nfor her excellent work (Exhibit H).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated three significant delinquent debts in\nher name and they were not satisfied for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant\u2019s overdue debts, that are\nthe subject of this case, occurred beginning in 2000, at the request of her mother and\nfor the benefit of someone other than Applicant. Applicant\u2019s current finances are in good\norder and she has no overdue debts, so I find that her previous adverse financial\ncondition does not cast doubt on her current reliability. \n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s request that she sign or cosign the\nloans for the benefit of Mr. A. When he died the estate that was too pay these debts\nbecame involved in litigation, and the debts were not paid for an extended period of\ntime, through no fault of Applicant. Applicant did act responsibly under these\ncircumstances by continuing to follow up with her mother to make certain these debts\nwere ultimately resolved. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant is now financially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s reasons for her previous financial\ndifficulties, her excellent economic condition today, her current positive employment\nstatus, and the exceptional testimony offered on her behalf by the other witnesses at the\nhearing, I find that the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 55 years old and divorced with three adult children. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants. The Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. (See Applicant\u2019s response to SOR). He began consuming alcohol to excess at the age of eighteen in about 1970. His excessive use of alcohol continued off and on until at least October 2007. During this period, he was charged, arrested and convicted of six alcohol related incidents that include, two Public Intoxication charges, an Alcohol in a Closed Area charge, and three arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) or Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). From 1973 until 1978, the Applicant served in the United States Air Force. For the past twenty years, he has been working for his current employer, and has held a security clearance since 1972. He is also a part-time musician who has worked in the studio where he has consumed alcohol to help him relax from time to time. The Ap",

Goldstein Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Edward O. Lear, Attorney At Law\nJuly 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 14,\n2006.  On February 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nG for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 19, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through Counsel on March 7, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge.  The matter was assigned to this Administrative Judge on April\n10, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 17, 2008, and the matter was\nscheduled for hearing on May 29, 2008.  The Government presented thirteen Exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 13, which were received without\nobjection. The Applicant presented two Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\n\n2\nand B, which were received without objection.  He also testified on his own behalf.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 11, 2008.   I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until close of business on June 5, 2008, to\nsubmit additional documentation.  On June 5, 2008, the Applicant submitted one Post-\nHearing Exhibit, consisting of two pages, that was received without objection. The\nrecord closed on June 6, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is  denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55 years old and divorced with three adult children.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  (See Applicant\u2019s response to SOR).  He began consuming alcohol to excess\nat the age of eighteen in about 1970.  His excessive use of alcohol continued off and on\nuntil at least October 2007.  During this period, he was charged, arrested and convicted\nof six alcohol related incidents that include, two Public Intoxication charges, an Alcohol\nin a Closed Area charge, and three arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol\n(DUI) or Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). \nFrom 1973 until 1978, the Applicant served in the United States Air Force.  For\nthe past twenty years, he has been working for his current employer, and has held a\nsecurity clearance since 1972.  He is also a part-time musician who has worked in the\nstudio where he has consumed alcohol to help him relax from time to time.     \nThe Applicant was arrested and charged with Public Intoxication on two\noccasions, August 15, 1972 and two days later, on August 17, 1972.  He was sentenced\nto jail time and served about ten days in jail.  (Tr. p. 37 and Government Exhibits 8, 9\nand 10 ).  \nIn October 1977, he was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.\nThe Applicant had been drinking alcohol and was pulled over for speeding.  He pled\nguilty, was fined approximately $500.00, was required to attend a DWI or George Air\nForce Base course.  His drivers license was suspended for six months, and he was\nplaced on probation for two years.  (Government Exhibits 8, 9 and 10)\nIn December 1981, the Applicant was arrested and charged with a felony offense\nof Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Involving Injuries.  The Applicant explained\n\n3\nthat it was Christmas Eve, he had gotten off of work early and had been consuming\nalcohol (screwdrivers) most of the day.  He was looking in his glove box for a cassette\ntape when a car pulled out in front of him on the highway and he rear ended it, causing\nthe car to turn over.  Both the driver and the passenger in the other car received skull\nfractures.  (Tr. p. 38).  The Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol level was .27%.  He was found\nguilty and was sentenced to serve 180 days in jail (on weekends), was fined\napproximately $1,300.00, his drivers license was revoked for one year and he was\nplaced on probation for three years.  Following this incident, the Applicant did not\nconsume alcohol again for about six years, until 1987.  (Tr. p. 39 and Government\nExhibits 6 and 12).  \nIn February 1983, the Applicant provided a statement to the Defense\nInvestigative Service wherein he stated, \u201cSince the incident, I have not drank alcohol,\nand it is my intention never to do so again.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 6 and Tr. p. 40).\nIn about 1987 or so, the Applicant gradually started consuming alcohol again.\nHis drinking increased to about three times a month and to the point of intoxication\nabout two times a year.  (Tr. pp. 42-43).  Ten years later, in July 1993, the Applicant\nwas charged with alcohol in a closed area.  He was found guilty and fined $76.00.\n(Government Exhibit 5).  \nIn March 2006, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under\nthe Influence - Alcohol, and (2) Driving Under the Influence with Alcohol Over .08%.\nThe Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol level actually tested at .16%.  The Applicant explained\nthat he was going to a friend\u2019s house and had been drinking earlier that evening.  He\nwas driving onto the freeway.  The roads were icy and he lost traction and went off of\nthe road.  Pursuant to a plea bargain, Count (3) Wet Reckless Involving Alcohol was\nadded.  The Applicant pled Nolo Contendere to Count (3) and was sentenced to pay a\nfine and fees totaling $1,075.00, to complete a 16 week alcohol education program, his\ndrivers license was suspended for one month, and he was required to make restitution\nin the amount of $3,717.47.  He was placed on summary probation for three years,\nwhich will not expire until June 2009.  (Government Exhibits 8 and 11)\nPursuant to court order, the Applicant attended a three month course beginning\nin about May 2006, which included 12 hours of Alcohol Education, six hours of self-help\nmeetings, eight Alcoholic Anonymous meetings and 18 hours of group sessions.  He\nsuccessfully completed the program in about August 2006.\nUp until three and a half months ago, the Applicant continued to consume alcohol\ndespite the fact that he is currently on probation.  He does not believe that he is\naddicted to alcohol, however, he keeps it in his house for friends who come to visit.  (Tr.\np. 50).  He indicated that he attended and completed the meetings required by the court\nbut did not find it worthwhile to continue seeking treatment of any kind.  However, upon\nreceipt of the notice of hearing in this matter, he took several steps to remind himself\nnot to drink.  He hung several posters in his house, one on his door that says, \u201cDrink\nResponsibly\u201d, and another from his employer that says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget who you work for\u201d.\nOn the refrigerator there is another poster from the DMV that reminds him of the blood\n\n4\nalcohol levels.  He also purchased a breathalyzer to test his blood alcohol level.  (Tr. p.\n30).  The Applicant states that drinking is not as important to him as the other things that\nhe has going on in his life.  (Tr. p. 31).  His recent alcohol related arrest and conviction\ncost him at least $35,000.00 out of pocket.  (Tr. p. 49).        \nHe has not consumed any alcohol for the past three and a half months and plans\nto continue to remain abstinent.\nTwelve letters of recommendation from professional colleagues and long time\nfriends who have known and/or worked with the Applicant for many years attest to his\nprofessional manner, positive and respectful attitude, honesty, hardworking and\ncompassionate nature, integrity and trustworthiness.  He is considered to be a\ndedicated family man, who is responsible, patriotic, loyal, security conscious, and\nhonorable in every aspect of his life.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A (1) through A (12)).    \nAn affidavit from the Applicant dated May 30, 2008, indicates that as of May 19,\n2008, he has eliminated all consumable alcohol from his residence.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit).  \nThe Applicant received an Instant Recognition Award from his employer on\nDecember 4, 2001.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d apply. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly\nGuideline G is found against the Applicant. \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse began over thirty-seven years ago and\nhas resulted in at least six alcohol related arrests, including two public intoxication\ncharges, an alcohol in a closed area charge, and three arrests for DUI.  His last arrest\noccurred in 2006, just two years ago, and he remains on probation for the offense until\nJune 2009.  In 1983, the Applicant told the Department of Defense that he was not\ngoing to consume alcohol again, but he later returned to his excessive drinking habit.\nPresently, he has only abstained from the use of alcohol for the past three and a half\nmonths and again he says that he has no intentions of ever drinking.  Hopefully, this\ntime, the Applicant will be able to completely abstain from excessive alcohol abuse.\n      \n\n7\nAlthough there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol dependence, the\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol abuse is clearly indicative of a serious alcohol problem\nthat he still has not gained an understanding of.  He has again made the commitment to\nstop drinking.  In order to stay sober, he has posted reminders around him, on the door\nand the refrigerator and has purchased a breathalyzer.  Recently, he has eliminated\nalcohol from his home.  However, he is not working a structured recovery program that\nincludes Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or any other recognized alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram. Three and a half months of abstinence is only the beginning of a long program\nof recovery and is no guarantee that he will not return to his old habits.  Based upon his\nlong history of alcohol abuse and its related effects on the Applicant there is insufficient\nevidence in the record to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy at this time.      \nI have also carefully considered the favorable statements from his professional\ncolleagues and friends but that evidence does not come close to mitigating the negative\neffect of his numerous alcohol related arrests. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.   Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.\n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n____________________________\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, dated December 8, 2009, and\nelected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on April 17, 2009. Applicant received a copy\nof the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 22, 2009. Applicant did not submit any\nadditional information. I received the case assignment on August 3, 2009. The\nAugust 14, 2009\n\n2\nGovernment submitted nine items in support of its case. Based upon a review of the\nrecord, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 9, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f, and 2.a. through 2.c of the SOR. He did not provide\nany additional information for the record.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 1970. From February 1971 until December 1972, he served on\ninactive reserve in the United States Army (USA). He is divorced and has one adult\nchild. Applicant has been employed as a warehouse specialist with his current employer\nsince October 2000 (Item 4).\nIn 1991, Applicant was arrested for sexually molesting the teenage daughter of\nhis former girlfriend (Item 3). He was charged with four counts of indecent liberties with\nchildren (Felony). He pled guilty and was convicted of indecent liberties and indecent\nliberties with a juvenile (Item 7). Two counts were Nolle Prossed.\nIn June 1996, Applicant was arrested for profane, threatening language over a\npublic airway (misdemeanor) and burning or destroying a dwelling (felony). During a\nphone call argument with his girlfriend, Appellant threatened to beat her up and to burn\ndown her house (Item 3). Both charges were Nolle Prossed.\nIn 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with stalking (felony). The charges\nwere later dismissed. In October 1997, Applicant was charged with Failure to Appear\n(misdemeanor). The charges were later dismissed (Item 6).\nIn 1998, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI). He\nattended a Christmas party. He drove home after drinking at the party and was stopped\nby the police for a headlight violation. He appeared in court and was convicted of DUI\n(Item 8). He was fined $250.\nIn May 2007, Applicant was arrested for trespassing (misdemeanor). This\nhappened when he arrived at a girlfriend\u2019s home and waited for her to come home. She\nwas angry that he was there trying to confront her about dating other people (Item 9).\nThe charges were later dropped.\nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application on January 29, 2007. He\nanswered Section 23(d) concerning charges or convictions of a felony offense regarding\nhis criminal history by listing a 1999 DUI conviction. He did not disclose the other\narrests that resulted in felony charges in 1996 and 1997, nor his 1992 conviction for\nindecent liberties. Applicant admitted that he falsified his security clearance application\n(Item 3). He did not explain or give any rationale.\n\n3\nApplicant was interviewed by a Department of Defense (DOD) investigator in\nApril 2008 (Item 5). He acknowledged and admitted the behavior that resulted in his\nseries of arrests.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n4\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to his criminal history. He was arrested in 1991, 1996, 1997,\n1998, and 2007. He was convicted of DUI in 1998. In 1991, Applicant was arrested and\nfound guilty of two felony charges. AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply in this case.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has not provided any mitigation for his criminal behavior. He has a\npattern of criminal activity from 1991. Applicant\u2019s last incident of criminal conduct was in\nMay 2007. This is too soon to find that he is successfully rehabilitated. There is no\nevidence in the record that Applicant received any counseling to suggest that this\nbehavior would not occur again in the future. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply in\nthis case.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\n\n5\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d is\npotentially disqualifying.\nApplicant only disclosed his 1999 DUI on his security clearance application in\nresponse to Section 23 concerning his police record. He acknowledged that he omitted\nother offenses. He admitted that he had a deliberate intent to falsify his answers to the\nquestions. Applicant admitted to his falsifications in his answer. He did not provide any\nexplanation or rationale to supplement the record.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6\n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Army for a\none year. He has been employed in a variety of positions. He provided little information\nupon which to base a favorable \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.\nApplicant was a mature man when he committed the sexual offenses with a\njuvenile. He has a pattern of criminal activity involving women. He deliberately falsified\n\n6\nhis security clearance application in 2007. His last incident of criminal behavior was in\n2007.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 11, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing on June 20, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-\n2, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and\npresented the testimony of one witness. He submitted exhibits (AE) A-R. I left the record\nAugust 4, 2008\n\n2\nopen until July 15, 2008 at the request of Counsel for Applicant. Applicant submitted\ninformation concerning the interview that was scheduled and held on July 8, 2008. The\nrecord closed on August 1, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nJune 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, testimony, and pleadings, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegation in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. Applicant provided additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1986 and attended college courses for a brief period (AE O). He has\nbeen employed with his current employer since 2005 (GE 1). \nApplicant worked for a local company for nineteen years. He received the highest\naward possible from that company (Business Improvement Award) (AE N). He was the\nincident commander at the facility. He left when new management arrived to pursue a\nnew opportunity. He did not have a security clearance for his prior job, nor did he need\none.\nApplicant is twice divorced. He married his current wife on May 18, 2006. He met\nhis wife through her brother with whom he worked in 2002. He did not date her until\n2005. Applicant learned that she was an illegal alien. However, he also knew that she\nhad an application for adjustment status filed through the sponsorship of her brother in\n2001 (AE C).\nApplicant\u2019s wife filed her document I-130 with the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS) in 2001. Applicant contacted an attorney after he married his wife. He\nlearned that there was a flood of paperwork being processed at that time due to\ngovernment policy (Tr. 35). Applicant was advised to file another form for his wife using\nhis name as sponsor. He completed that task in April 2006. His understanding was that\nit would be expedited. When Applicant completed his SF 86 and spoke to an\ninvestigator, he communicated that information. However, when he called his\nimmigration attorney, he learned that in fact, the form had not yet been filed. His\nattorney acknowledged that he neglected to expedite the case (AE R) A petition for\nadjustment of status was eventually filed for his wife on October 21, 2007 (Tr. 38). The\ndelay in the filing was not the fault of Applicant.\nApplicant and his wife had an appointment with the Immigration office on July 7,\n2008. (AE R). The interview that had been scheduled for March 27, 2008 was\npostponed by the attorney due to a scheduling conflict. Applicant expects that his wife\nwill become a permanent resident of the U.S. after the interview process. They are\nwaiting for the final processing. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s immigration attorney attended the\n\n3\nhearing and spoke on her behalf. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s fingerprint check revealed no\ncriminal record.\nApplicant\u2019s wife arrived in the U.S. in 2000 after crossing the border in Arizona.\nShe stayed with her sister and her brother. She has another brother in the U.S. Her\nbrother is a U.S. citizen and her sister is a permanent resident who is pursuing\ncitizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is not working but she is authorized to work. She has an\nemployment authorization card (AE A). She is taking English classes and takes various\ncollege courses. She is studying so that she could get a job in the future (AE P). She\npossesses a valid driver\u2019s license (AE A). Applicant and his wife are active in church\nactivities. He sometimes goes with his wife to class.\nApplicant has an exemplary work record in his former company and his current\none (AE N). He has a responsible position. He has not had any incidents or problems in\nhis work or personal life. He received letters of recommendation and a service award in\n2005. Applicant has no criminal record (AE D).\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s wife entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico, she can still\napply for permanent residence in the U.S. Section 245I of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA) allows adjustment of status for the alien if a provable petition was\nfiled for the alien before April 30, 2001, and that alien was present in the U.S. on\nDecember 20, 2000. She is not in any type of criminal status and is not subject to being\narrested and/or deported for simply being here in the U.S. She has no criminal record\n(AE E).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:\n(C) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\n\n5\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulation, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and many not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\nApplicant met, dated and married a woman from Mexico whose status in the U.S.\nis not legal. This involvement with someone who has violated laws of the U.S. is\nsufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions under 16(c) and (d). \nThe AG \u00b6 16 continues:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing. \nThis disqualifying condition is also a factor for consideration in this case.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically,\nAG \u00b6 17 states:\n(C) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement. \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does apply. \nAG 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress is a factor for consideration. \nApplicant acknowledged that he knew his wife was an illegal alien when he met\nher in 2002. However, her brother had already petitioned for her change of status in\nApril 2001. There was a delay in the process through no fault of Applicant. Afer their\nmarriage, Applicant filed another petition for his wife. They had a hearing on July 7,\n2008. Applicant\u2019s wife is not in any criminal status pending the determination. Applicant\n\n6\nhas no criminal record. He was open and forthright about his wife\u2019s situation. Moreover,\nshe is pending status for permanent residence. I conclude these were a unique set of\ncircumstances and that Applicant has mitigated any security concerns under the\npersonal conduct guidelines.   \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard working\nresponsible man. He was employed with one company for almost 20 years. He now is\nworking for a defense contractor. He is a loyal employee. He is enthusiastic about his\njob. He has earned the respect and appreciation of his supervisors and co-workers. He\nis stable and concerned about his future. He has received excellent performance ratings\nand evaluations. Government counsel even conceded that Applicant\u2019s professional life\nis without tarnish. \nApplicant met his wife through her brother with whom he worked. They\nestablished a friendship in 2002. They started dating in 2005. Applicant married in 2006,\nand acknowledged that he knew at that time that she was an illegal alien. However, he\nalso knew that her brother had sponsored her for change of status. He could not\nforesee that problems with processing would develop. Before he married her, he could\nnot do anything to sponsor her himself. He did not violate any rules or regulations. He\ndemonstrated his determination to address his wife\u2019s illegal alien status and acquire\nlegal resident status of her. I have considered that evidence in this decision.\nOverall, the record evidence and whole person analysis leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising\nfrom his personal conduct. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old sub-contractor working for a Federal government entity. She has a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree and a master of science (M.S.) degree in management information systems. She is a successful professional who is lauded in her field. Her personal attributes and community involvement are thoroughly 1 praised by peers from her community. She is divorced and has no children. 2 After graduating from high school in 1976, Applicant went to college. During that time, she may have experimented with drugs. In 1978, on the last day of summer 3 school in her sophomore year, she was caught in a fire and severely burned. She was treated in a hospital for three or four months with second and third degree burns all over her body. Over the next 15 years, she would undergo seven or eight surgeries related to the injury. Prior to the end of her series of surgeries, she was married from 4 September 1991 until her divorce in August 1992. During her divorce, Applicant used 5 marijuana. Applicant\u2019s references to her divorce time frame generally equate to the time frame of her marriage, 1991-1992.

On\nJanuary 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns regarding personal conduct\nand criminal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SOR issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations on January 28, 2008, by denying all\nallegations raised. The case was assigned to me on March 15, 2008. Department\nCounsel and Applicant agreed to an April 9, 2008, hearing date and a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on March 17, 2008, setting the hearing for that date. \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n Exs.

Outside of that, no. It\u2019s the only other\n    3\ntime other than that I\u2019ve used drugs is in 1991, during my divorce time frame.\u201d \n Applicant was unable to recall the years or exact number of her surgeries. Tr. 35.\n    4\n These dates come from Applicant\u2019s SF-86.\n    5\n Tr. 72.\n    6\n Tr. 72-74.\n    7\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits\n(Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted 14 exhibits, which were accepted as Exs. A-N without objection. Two\nwitnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 18,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance\nis granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old sub-contractor working for a Federal government\nentity. She has a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree and a master of science (M.S.)\ndegree in management information systems. She is a successful professional who is\nlauded in her field.  Her personal attributes and community involvement are thoroughly\n1\npraised by peers from her community.  She is divorced and has no children. \n2\nAfter graduating from high school in 1976, Applicant went to college. During that\ntime, she may have experimented with drugs.  In 1978, on the last day of summer\n3\nschool in her sophomore year, she was caught in a fire and severely burned. She was\ntreated in a hospital for three or four months with second and third degree burns all\nover her body. Over the next 15 years, she would undergo seven or eight surgeries\nrelated to the injury.  Prior to the end of her series of surgeries, she was married from\n4\nSeptember 1991 until her divorce in August 1992.  During her divorce, Applicant used\n5\nmarijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s references to her divorce time frame generally equate to the time\nframe of her marriage, 1991-1992. Without a copy of her divorce decree in front of her,\nor a document like the SF-86 which she may have filled out with the help of a copy of\nthe decree, she cannot remember exactly when the divorce was.  Nor is she capable of\n6\nremembering when she returned to college in the 1990s without resort to\ndocumentation or reference to the divorce.7\nApplicant is clear, however, she returned to college to finish her undergraduate\ndegree after she was divorced. She then completed her undergraduate degree in\n\n Tr. 41.\n    8\n Id.\n    9\n W ith regard to her undergraduate degree, the date noted is from her SF-86. It clarifies her statement that\n    10\n\u201cI think I got my B.S. degree in 1996. . . .\u201d Tr. 34. Inasmuch as the SF-86 does not indicate a date for her\ngraduate degree completion, reliance is on her statement: \u201cI think that was \u201899.\u201d Tr. 34.\n \u201cI think I\u2019ve had a clearance since, maybe 2000, maybe before that. I \u2013 \u2013 I\u2019ve had a clearance a long time.\u201d\n    11\nTr. 37.\n Monthly use from January 1992 through December 1998 would indicate 84 instances; every other month\n    12\nuse would denote 42 instances of marijuana use.\n3\nAugust 1996. It was in 1996 that she first began work as a federal contractor. After\nreceiving her bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant continued with school and worked on a\nmaster\u2019s degree. During that time she was engaged, but her fianc\u00e9e died before she\ngraduated.  In distinguishing this academic period of her life from the time of her\n8\ndivorce, Applicant noted that \u201c[i]t was schooling that helped me get through that whole\nscenario. Not drugs.\u201d  She completed her graduate degree in 1999.  She thinks she\n9\n10\nreceived her first security clearance in 2000.  \n11\nApplicant completed an unsigned SF-86 form that was electronically submitted\non July 1, 1999. In response to question 27, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example,\nmarijuana. . . ,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d In response to question 28, \u201cHave you EVER\nillegally used a controlled substance while . . . possessing a security clearance. . . ,\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cno.\u201d An identical or virtually identical application was electronically\nsubmitted on January 13, 2000, with no discernable changes. The hard copies of those\nelectronic transmissions are unsigned.\nAn SF-86 form signed by Applicant on October 3, 2002, and again signed on\nMay 28, 2003, does have discernable updates. Her city, county, and state of birth are\nincorrectly identified. Applicant\u2019s employment and foreign travel destinations are up-\ndated. A top secret security clearance from one Government entity is specifically noted\nas received on October 5, 1999, and a confidential security clearance from another\nGovernment entity is documented as having been received on August 1, 2000, refuting\nher earlier belief she first received a security clearance in 2000. Appellant\u2019s negative\nanswers regarding past drug use remained unchanged.  \nAn investigator\u2019s statement summarized an interview of Applicant on May 28,\n2003. The summary, which was not signed by Applicant, states that Applicant revealed\nshe began using marijuana in late 1991 or early 1992, after her divorce; she used the\ndrug once a month or every other month until 1999.  Her estimate of usage was stated\n12\nas being approximately 200 times during that period. The interviewer stated Applicant\ndid not use marijuana in the year 2000 through May 2002 for fear of being given a\nrandom drug test. It further states she recommenced using marijuana in May 2002. \n\n Ex. 4 (Statement of July 9, 2003) at 1. The 2002/2003 SF-86 incorrectly identifies Appellant\u2019s city of birth,\n    13\nbut reflects the proper year of birth. See Ex. 3 (NSA Denial, dated February 28, 2006).\n Id.\n    14\n Id. at 2.\n    15\n Id at 3.\n    16\n See also Tr. 51.\n    17\n Id. at 4.\n    18\nEx. 4, supra note 8, at 4.\n    19\n Tr. 58-61.

W e can\u2019t sit here all day,\u2019 And I said \u2018Okay.\n    20\nW ell, that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll go with this.\u201d Tr. 61.\n Tr. 58.\n    21\n4\nAfter a July 9, 2003, interview, Applicant signed a statement prepared with the\nassistance of a special agent. In that statement, Applicant properly stated her year and\ncity of birth, noting she must have mistakenly acknowledged the wrong city and year on\nher October 2002/May 2003 SF-86 form or some other unidentified form.  On that\n13\nsame page, there is a typed comment regarding her place of residence and a\ntenant/cohabitant. It is situated between her written initials and the handwritten notation\n\u201cAttachment 1 (2 pages).\u201d No attachment, however, is appended to, or incorporated\ninto, the submitted exhibit.  In another section, Appellant noted that her academic\n14\ncareer was nearly ended when she was once accused of plagiarism in graduate school.\nShe did not, however, recall the name of the professor.  On page three, she stated that\n15\nshe did not know the whereabouts of her father, her ex-husband, or two of her\nsiblings.  \n16\nRegarding her past drug use, Applicant\u2019s July 9, 2003, statement reads: \u201cI did\nnot indicate any drug use on my security form because I believe my last use was prior\nto the last 7 years. From my best recollection, my last use was in late 96 or early 97.  I\n17\nam disclosing this information because I am not definitely sure about the year.\u201d  No\n18\ndistinction is made as to whether Applicant meant the SF-86 security form transmitted\nin July 1999 or January 2000, nor is it clear she knew it was twice transmitted. She\ncharacterized her drug use as limited to marijuana at social gatherings, \u201cand I would\naveraged to have been at least 10 but no more than 20 times. . . .\u201d  \n19\nDuring the interview, Applicant felt pressed to provide precise dates and\nnumerical ranges of instances of marijuana use based on the investigator\u2019s\nquestioning.  When further pressed for an answer, she ultimately gave a number just\n20\nto satisfy the inquiry. She thought to herself: \u201cAnd then afterwards I said \u2018You know, this\nis going to come back to haunt me.\u2019\u201d  In reviewing her statement during the hearing,\n21\nApplicant acknowledged she gave those answers, but commented: \u201cBut I tell you the\n\n Tr. 53.\n    22\n Tr. 56.\n    23\n Tr. 54.\n    24\n Ex. 5 (Applicant\u2019s Interrogatory Response, 2007).\n    25\n Although the page lacks letterhead, it does contain a template for the \u201cFor Official Use Only\u201d stamp on the\n    26\nbottom of the sheet indicating the document of some Government or Department origin. \n Tr. 46.\n    27\n Tr. 45, 48.\n    28\n Tr. 45.\n    29\n Tr. 46.\n    30\n5\ndates is what I\u2019m confused about . . .

I don\u2019t recall saying that I did that.\u201d  In further questioning\n23\nregarding dates, she became more confused: \u201cOkay. Here I\u2019m getting confused\nagain.\u201d  \n24\nOn December 8, 2006, Applicant gave an unsworn declaration to an Office of\nPersonnel Management representative. The Government introduced it as part of its\nExhibit 5, which is described in the Index of Government Exhibits as \u201cApplicant\u2019s\nInterrogatory Response, signed on December 13, 2007 (including summary of\nApplicant\u2019s interview from December 8, 2006)(12 pages).\u201d  Its four sections of\n25\nmaterials vary in format, but it is stapled as a whole document. The second section is\nthe typed testimony from an \u201cInterview Conducted Under Unsworn Declaration on\n12/08/06,\u201d in which Applicant is repeatedly noted as being unable to recall specific\nnames, dates, and facts from her past. She affirms she used marijuana during the\n1991-1992 time frame, during her divorce. She denied drug use between 1992 and\n1999, but concedes she may have smoked marijuana one or two times while attending\ncollege between 1996 to 1999. In what appears to be direct responses to specific\nquestions, she stated she did not recall using drugs since 1999 or in May 2002. Tthe\ntestimony is followed by a section bearing no letterhead.  It seeks affirmation from\n26\nApplicant that she reviewed the report and affirmed its content as accurate. Her\nsignature and a notary seal indicate she was offered this review on December 13, 2007,\nover a year after the 2006 interview. No reason is indicated for this delay.\nFor many years now, Applicant has been far removed from the \u201cparty\u201d scene.27\nShe has \u201cgrown considerably\u201d since her divorce and her use of marijuana. She now\nlives a \u201cclean life.\u201d  That clean life is one with many adult responsibilities  and she no\n28\n29\nlonger associates with her former marijuana indulgers or those who use drugs.  Since\n30\neschewing drugs and those who use them, Applicant has worked for and received both\na B.S. and a M.S. degree. She is busy with work, but also takes time to volunteer within\nher community, helping the jobless and homeless in her community find work and self-\n\n Tr. 45-46.\n    31\n Tr. 20, 45.\n    32\n Tr. 19, 47.\n    33\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n34\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n35\n36\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n Id.\n    37\n Id.\n    38\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    39\n7\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n37\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n38\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n39\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant maintains she smoked marijuana around the time of her divorce, in\n1991-1992, and used it about 10-20 times. That was her position when she completed\nher first SF-86s and it remained her position at the hearing. The Government presented\nevidence from intervening interviews, statements, and summaries bearing inconsistent\nanswers to the same questions regarding frequency and time frame of drug use. It\nargues her successive inconsistent answers demonstrate she purposefully misled or\ndeceived the Government. However, Applicant\u2019s inconsistencies on matters both of\nrelevance and on immaterial matters run throughout the documents discussed. She\nrepeatedly couches her answers in tentative terms and acknowledges her poor recall.\nLost on specific dates, she commonly has to make reference to her divorce (drug use)\nor to her return to college (no drug use) to establish a time frame. The overwhelming\nevidence demonstrates not that she lied or misled, but that she has poor recall with\n\n If this is a ploy, it has been adroitly executed with uncanny consistency for nearly a decade. \n    40\n Applicant has been at her most reliable, or at least most consistent, with regard to her SF-86s. Her allusion\n    41\nto possibly having had a copy of her divorce decree at hand when she completed her SF-86s may provide a\nclue that her answers on those forms were entered with documentary assistance to refresh her memory. \n8\nregard to personal matters. Moreover, some of the interview summaries upon which the\nGovernment depends contain wildly inconsistent statements. For example, the giant\nleap from her having used marijuana 10-20 times to having used it 200 times. Such\ndiscrepancies, especially in the case of an unsigned declaration or one signed over a\nyear after the fact, makes one ponder whether there is a transcription mistake or\ninterpretative misunderstanding at play. The one constant seems to be the Applicant\u2019s\nSF-86, which was apparently completed with the aid of documents, such as her divorce\ndecree. Given these facts, I do not find any of the Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions applicable. \nIn the alternative, however, if falsity is found, Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities) and PC DC AG \u00b6 16(b)(deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative) apply.\nThe evidence presented by the Government against Applicant comes directly\nfrom her own statements and submissions, as well as from purported representations of\nher statements. Applicant has overcome several obstacles to get where she is today, a\nlauded professional in her particular field. In maintenance of a security clearance, she\nhas comported herself professionally, welcomed interviews, and conveyed appropriate\nequivocation when she was unsure of an answer. Based on the record and her highly\ncredible appearance at the hearing, however, her recall with regard to her personal life\nis poor and unreliable. The more a question is rephrased, the more visibly frustrated\nshe grows in not being able to be more precise. When persisted into giving a date\nrange or a guess, she often gave the latter equivocally. While it may be argued that a\nselective memory is to her advantage with regard to the time frame of her marijuana\nusage and the number of instances she abused drugs, her lack of recall has been\nconsistently shown to extend equally to minor and immaterial matters.  She\n40\nmisidentified her city, county, and state of birth on one SF-86 through simple\nnegligence. She apparently misidentified her year of birth on a form. She cannot\nremember the number of surgeries her tragic accident required. She has varying\nrecollections as to what year she received her first security clearance.  She has lost\n41\ncontact information for siblings. She cannot remember the name of the professor who\naccused her of plagiarism, although the incident almost jeopardized her academic\ncareer. She is unable to recall the dates of her marriage or the date she was divorced.\nShe cannot remember when she returned to college in the 1990s, except that it was\nafter the time frame of her divorce. These latter two memory lapses are particularly\n\n9\nnotable because they are repeatedly used to frame a reference for when she stopped\nusing marijuana. While her professional credentials and success portray her as a gifted\nbusinesswoman, her statements and testimony consistently show that she can be\nabsent minded with regard to her personal life. To her credit, however, she has\nconsistently forewarned interviewers when she was unsure of dates, events, and\nidentities, so it is hard to imagine her memory lapses now are a matter of convenience.\nDespite sufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s recall is imprecise, the Government\nrelies heavily on her inconsistencies. In particular, it relies on two exhibits to\ndemonstrate Applicant falsified or misled investigators. Those two exhibits, however,\nare not without flaws. The May 2003 interview concerned answers to questions entered\non SF-86s dating back to 1999 and covering events occurring over a decade earlier. In\nthat interview, her answers varied wildly. She indicated she used marijuana 200 times\nbetween late 1991 or early 1992 until 1999, using it once a month or every other month.\nYet the interviewer never asked how or why her drug use continued after 1992, when it\nincreased from 10-20 instances to 200 instances, or how such infrequent use could add\nup to 200 incidents. The jump from 10-20 incidents to 200, in particular, is so\ninconsistent it is striking. Applicant, however, never signed that statement and there is\nno indication she was ever afforded the opportunity to review it. Such striking\ninconsistency and the failure to offer Applicant an opportunity to review affect the\nweight the statement should be given. Similar questions arise regarding the reliability of\nthe December 8, 2006, statement included in the oddly comprised Exhibit 5. It appears\nApplicant was afforded the opportunity to review the statement attributed to her and to\nnote whether it accurately reflected her conversation. That opportunity, however, was\ncuriously and inexplicably not extended until December 13, 2007, over a year after the\ninterview. It would be difficult to expect anyone to reliably affirm or refute detailed notes\nfrom a meeting over a year in the past. Again, such facts must be considered in\nweighing the reliability of the document. Aside from issues regarding the weight of the\nevidence, Given the flaws and weaknesses of these documents in contrast to\nApplicant\u2019s admitted difficulties with recall, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC\nMC) AG \u00b6 17(f) (the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability) is applicable with regard to these statements. \nThe July 9, 2003, statement appears to be the most reliable evidence presented,\nalthough it also has a curious fault. The first page alludes to a two-page attachment that\nis not appended to the document. Regardless, the statement is signed and there is no\nindication Applicant objected to her statement with regard to drug use. That statement\nlimits her drug use to 10-20 times, which is consistent with all other allusions except the\nwildly variant content in the unsigned statement from May 2003. Her date of last drug\nuse is extended beyond her divorce time frame.\nWith regard to her last drug use, Applicant prefaces her comments by stating, \u201cI\ndid not indicate any drug use on my security form because I believe my last drug use\nwas prior to the last 7 years.\u201d She then comes to her main point of departure\nconcerning past drug use \u2013 as based \u201c[f]rom [her] own recollection,\u201d she used\nmarijuana from the late 1991 to early 1992 period into late 1996 or early 1997. She then\nnotes that she was \u201cdisclosing this information because [she was] not definitely sure\n\n Of even less significance to the issues is Applicant\u2019s following sentence, where she states that despite\n    42\nbeing unsure, she is \u201ccertain that since 97 [she has] not been involved with any illegal drugs.\u201d It simply affirms\nno drug use since 1997; it does not necessarily admit or imply drug use prior to that year. \n Even if Applicant\u2019s drug use had continued until the end of her graduate program despite repeated\n    43\ntestimony she did not do drugs while in school, most of the following factors would still apply. \n10\nabout the year.\u201d Aside from the repeatedly equivocal language and disclaimers, the\ntime frame is implausible. \nAt the time, Applicant clearly meant to convey that her last drug use was prior to\nthe last seven years. She makes it clear that her suggestion of 1996/1997 is something\nof a \u201cguesstimate.\u201d Whether indicating her 1999 SF-86 or the security form submitted in\nMay 2003, neither could account for a seven year gap since drug use, and she clearly\nmeant to assert that seven years had passed between drug use and security form. In\nfailing to provide any follow up to these statements, the interviewer was left with an\ninconsistency.  Such a result offers little to substantiate the Government\u2019s allegations.\n42\nTherefore, PC MC AG \u00b6 17(f) again applies. \nIn the end, all the statements pertaining to Applicant\u2019s drug use come from her or\nare attributed to her. Inconsistency may indicate a lack of credibility or a scheme to\nmislead, but it may also indicate a basic inability to recall accurately. Here, Applicant\u2019s\ngift for recall was demonstrated at the hearing to be weak, although she was otherwise\ncredible in testimony, demeanor, and delivery. Repeatedly, however, she has\nexpressed her contrition and cited to her drug use as an evil she started and practiced\nduring the time frame of her divorce.  Years have passed since Applicant\u2019s divorce,\n43\nshe has not seen her ex-husband since that time, and she does not know his\nwhereabouts. She has since completed undergraduate school and earned a master\u2019s\ndegree. She has thrown herself into her work and excelled in her chosen profession.\nShe devotes significant time to her family and community. She has distanced herself\nfrom drug users. There is no indication she would use them again and no unrebutted\nevidence she has used them since her divorce. She has accumulated numerous\npersonal and professional references as to her character today. She demonstrated her\nwillingness to give true statements about her past drug use despite a recollection deficit\nfor personal detail. PC MC AG \u00b6 16(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), PC MC AG \u00b6\n16(c) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress), and PC MC AG \u00b6 16 (g) (association with\npersons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do\nnot cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness\nto comply with rules and regulations) apply. \n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n    44\n11\nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\nuntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with rules, laws, and regulations.  Conditions that could raise a\n44\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31 (a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, (b)\ndischarge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions, (c)\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted; (d) individual is currently on parole\nor probation, and (e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-\nmandated rehabilitation program.\nThe criminal conduct here is the allegation that Applicant misled investigators,\nnot her past drug use. Having previously determined Applicant did not intentionally\nmislead or defraud, no Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) applies. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature, self-made woman who has overcome\nadversity to complete her education and become a successful professional. The period\nat issue concerns minimal to moderate marijuana in the 1990s, with no suggestion she\nhas used the substance in the last five years. Her documentary statements on the\nmatter come from 1999 to 2003. Consequently, both the personal and criminal conduct\nat issue are matters now squarely in the past.\n\n12\nThe Government culled from statements Applicant has made over the years to\nexpand her use of drugs to beyond the 1991-1992/divorce time period she claims. In\ndoing so, the Government contends Applicant falsified her SF-86 forms and mislead\ninvestigators. Those same statements, however, hold their own inconsistencies or flaws\nwhich bring their reliability into question. They also reflect the fact that Applicant\u2019s\nrecollection with regard to personal matters \u2013 dates, people, and places \u2013 is poor. The\nentire period between her marriage and her returning to college seems to be a blur,\nincluding her drug use. In the end, it is a matter of \u201cshe said\u201d versus what \u201cshe\ntentatively said or was interpreted to have said.\u201d Giving the most weight to Applicant\u2019s\nlive testimony and her July 2003 statement, despite its missing attachment(s), Applicant\neither ceased using marijuana around 1992 or the end of 1996, beginning of 1997.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and argument, and after rereading the July\n2003 summation in context, it is clear that Applicant\u2019s intent was to convey not a\nspecific year, but that she had not used marijuana for at least seven years prior to her\nSF-86. That would automatically strike the late 1996/early 1997 benchmark as another\nindication of faulty memory. \nRegardless, Applicant has raised significant mitigating conditions with regard to\nboth the personal and criminal conduct security concerns. An examination of the whole\nperson shows a mature woman devoted to her career, her work, her community, and\nher family, with no other indications that raise issue with her veracity, trustworthiness,\nand honesty, or her intent to remain drug free. It is clearly consistent with the national\nsecurity to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2a:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant was involved with marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms. In addition, it alleges Applicant is disqualified from having a security clearance granted or renewed under federal law. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 34-year-old software engineer who is employed by a federal contractor. He is married and has no children. He has worked for his current employer since August 2003. Previously, he worked for the same company, also as a software engineer, from May 1997 to August 1999, before returning to school to further his education. His educational background includes a master\u2019s degree in computer science. He returned to school in September 1999 and was awarded the master\u2019s degree in December 2002. In November 2006, Applicant completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 4). His response to Question 26 indicates the federal government has not previously investigated his background or granted him a security clearance or both. Therefore, it appears he is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the Defense Department for the first time. In addition, in response to Question 24a, Applicant indicated that he had illegally used controlled substances within the last seven years.

Blank Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 18, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement. For the\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nApril 25, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n See Attorney Sheldon I. Cohen\u2019s seven articles on the origin, history, and demise of the Smith Amendment\n4\nat www.sheldoncohen.com/publications.\n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date. \nApplicant replied to the SOR in an undated response and indicated he did not\nwish to have a hearing. His reply or answer consisted of his handwritten responses on\nthe SOR and two enclosures consisting of letters of recommendation. The two letters\nare admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on\nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn February 8, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on February 12  and it was\n3\nth\nreceived by him on February 19 . He replied to the FORM within the allowed 30-day\nth\nperiod. His response consists of a one-page letter from a drug counselor, which is\nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nThe government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b in light of a change to the relevant\nfederal law. On January 28, 2008, the President signed into law Public Law 110-181,\nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Section 1072 of which\nrepealed 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, formerly known as the Smith Amendment.  This change is\n4\nnow codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. Applicant was provided notice of the motion when he\nreceived the FORM. Applicant made no mention of the motion when he replied to the\nFORM. Accordingly, based on the change to the law, and without objections, the motion\nis granted, and SOR \u00b6 1.b is amended as follows:\nDue to the fact that you are an unlawful user of a controlled\nsubstance or an addict (as defined in section 802(1) of Title\n21), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) disqualifies you from having a\nsecurity clearance granted or renewed by a federal agency.  \nIn addition, the government included in its FORM as an item of documentary\nevidence an account of an interview of Applicant (Exhibit 5). The interview was part of a\n\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n5\n Id. \n6\n3\nreport of investigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The\nROI indicates that the Applicant\u2019s interview was an unsworn declaration made in June\n2007. \nThe general rule is that a background ROI may not be received and considered\nby an administrative judge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be\n5\nreceived with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  \n6\nIn past cases, the government included an ROI in its FORM without an attempt to\nauthenticate it or offer some other method of getting the evidence to the trier of fact (for\nexample, stipulation). The ROI was excluded from consideration in those cases. Here,\nthe government authenticated the ROI through Applicant. In particular, in about August\n2007, it issued an interrogatory to Applicant asking him to review the ROI and state if it\naccurately reflected the information he provided during the interview (Exhibit 5).\nApplicant indicated it did. Accordingly, without objections, the ROI is admitted as a\nbusiness record or a public record or both and it will be considered. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant was involved with marijuana and\npsilocybin mushrooms. In addition, it alleges Applicant is disqualified from having a\nsecurity clearance granted or renewed under federal law. In his response to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole,\nthe following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old software engineer who is employed by a federal\ncontractor. He is married and has no children. He has worked for his current employer\nsince August 2003. Previously, he worked for the same company, also as a software\nengineer, from May 1997 to August 1999, before returning to school to further his\neducation. \nHis educational background includes a master\u2019s degree in computer science. He\nreturned to school in September 1999 and was awarded the master\u2019s degree in\nDecember 2002. \nIn November 2006, Applicant completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit\n4). His response to Question 26 indicates the federal government has not previously\ninvestigated his background or granted him a security clearance or both. Therefore, it\nappears he is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the Defense Department for\nthe first time. In addition, in response to Question 24a, Applicant indicated that he had\nillegally used controlled substances within the last seven years. In the explanation\n\n4\nsection, he stated that he had used marijuana, approximately once per week, from\nJanuary 2000 to October 2006. \nIn his background interview of June 2007, he confirmed his use of marijuana and\nprovided additional information (Exhibit 5). In summary, Applicant described his illegal\ndrug involvement as follows:\n\u2022\nHe admitted trying marijuana for the first time in 1994 when he was a college\nstudent due to what he characterized as peer pressure;\n\u2022\nHe admitted smoking marijuana about four times from 1994 to 1997;\n\u2022\nHe admitted smoking marijuana, because he liked the effect, about twice a week\nbeginning in June 2001 until sometime in 2002;\n\u2022\nHe admitted that, beginning in 2002 and continuing to the present, he bought\nsmall amounts of marijuana, and he smoked it twice a week; \n\u2022\nHe admitted that he intended to continue smoking marijuana at his current rate,\nfrequency, and amount in the future, although he planned to stop immediately if\nhe has children; and\n\u2022\nHe admitted using psilocybin mushrooms once in 2003 and again in 2004; he\ndoes not intend to use this substance in the future. \nIn his reply to the SOR, he admitted the allegations of illegal drug involvement. In\nsummary, he pointed out that he has been completely honest about his past and feels,\n\u201cperhaps indignantly,\u201d that he is being too harshly punished for his honesty. He believes\nhe did the right thing by disclosing his past. He indicated that he had sought drug\ncounseling and \u201cwill provably stop using marijuana.\u201d \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant provided a letter from a drug counselor\n(Exhibit B). The counselor stated that Applicant was in counseling for alcohol and other\ndrug abuse assessment, and that treatment began on March 20, 2008. She described\nApplicant as honest and open, and that he was subject to a drug screen that tested\nnegative. She found Applicant to be of above-average intelligence. She noted that\n\u201c[b]ecause of the short history of Cannabis usage, I would encourage random drug\nscreens, monthly, for one year.\u201d She ended her letter opining that Applicant was \u201cwell-\nbalanced emotionally\u201d and would be a \u201cstellar participant\u201d in an organization.  \nBoth letters of recommendation are highly favorable for Applicant (Exhibit A).\nBoth are authored by Applicant\u2019s superiors at his company. Both describe Applicant as\na professional and dependable employee. Both are impressed with Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge, skills, and abilities on the job. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n7\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n8\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n9\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.7\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n8\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n9\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about\n10\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved\nin favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions under Guideline H). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n20\n 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) (2008). \n21\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) (2000) (\u201cThe person is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance\u201d\n22\nas defined by federal law.). \n 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(a)(2) (defining a covered person under the statute). \n23\n6\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n17\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n18\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n19\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d20\nIn addition to the normal concerns under Guideline H, at issue here is whether\nApplicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from security clearance eligibility due to his\nillegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The pertinent law is now 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, which provides,\nin relevant part, as follows: \u201cAfter January 1, 2008, the head of a Federal agency may\nnot grant or renew a security clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of\na controlled substance or an addict\u201d as defined by federal law.  This prohibition uses\n21\nlanguage that is nearly identical to the previous prohibition in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.22\nAs a starting point, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c applies to Applicant because he is an\nemployee of a federal contractor.  Second, there is no evidence to prove that Applicant\n23\nis an addict. Third, there is ample evidence to prove that Applicant was an unlawful user\nof a controlled substance, as the record evidence shows that Applicant smoked\n\n See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005) (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) uses the present tense, not\n24\nthe past tense, when referring to unlawful use of, or addiction to, controlled substances; consequently, the\nAdministrative Judge erred by concluding that Congress intended that persons who had been addicted to, or\ndependent on, controlled substances in the past to be forever barred from being granted a clearance); ISCR\nCase No. 01-20314 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2003) (Administrative Judge erred by applying 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2)\nto an applicant who last used marijuana about two years before the hearing). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n25\n Applicant\u2019s use of mushrooms, once in 2003 and again in 2004, was situational and infrequent. Accordingly,\n26\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is decided for Applicant.  \n7\nmarijuana on a fairly regular basis and did so until June 2007 (Exhibit 5). But there is\ninsufficient evidence to prove that Applicant is currently an unlawful user. \nThe statutory prohibition in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) , like its predecessor in 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 986(c)(2), uses the present tense, not the past tense. A plain-meaning reading of the\nstatute cannot be stretched to apply to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use that took place about\nnine months ago in June 2007. To read it otherwise would result in a mandatory\ndisqualification of a person who engaged in drug abuse 12 months ago, 3 years ago, or\nperhaps at any time in the past, a result inconsistent with the plain meaning of the\nstatute. This interpretation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) is consistent with Appeal Board\ncaselaw from 2005 and 2003 when it interpreted 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) in the same\nway.  Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.b is decided for Applicant.  \n24\nTurning next to the normal concerns under Guideline H, based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a security concern:\n\u2022\nAny drug abuse (see above definition); and \n\u2022\nIllegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.25\nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug involvement raises a security concern because\nit calls into question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to obey the\nlaw. His drug of choice was marijuana.  He began using marijuana in 1994. Thereafter,\n26\nhe used it, on a periodic basis, until about June 2007. At times, he was a regular\nmarijuana user smoking it as frequently as twice a week. In addition, his marijuana use\nextends well beyond his initial college years when such activity may perhaps be\noverlooked as youthful experimentation or rebellion or both. Instead, his marijuana use\ncontinued into adulthood, including during his current employment as a software\nengineer. \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and none\napply to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. The evidence in his favor is minimal. Although\nApplicant began counseling or treatment about a month ago in March 2008, it is too\nsoon to determine  how he will progress. Likewise, it is too soon to determine if his\nefforts are genuine or a facade. Time will tell if Applicant will be able to establish a track\n\n8\nrecord of a drug-free lifestyle as a responsible adult. To sum up, the record evidence is\ntoo skimpy to conclude that he presented a convincing case in reform and rehabilitation.\n   \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the drug involvement security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept (including Applicant\u2019s honesty about his past, his\nrecord of higher education, and his good employment record) was given due\nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. This case is\ndecided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b\u20131.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 28, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 28, 2007, and requested a decision on the\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February\n7, 2007, and I received the case assignment on February 7, 2007. Based on the\nevidence of record, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J\nand his clearance is denied. Concerns under Guideline E are not raised.\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\nItem 2 (Response to SOR) at 1-2.\n1\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application (SF-86)) at 2-5; Response to FORM.\n2\nItem 1 (SOR) at 1-2; Item 2, supra note 1, at 3.\n3\nId.\n4\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 28, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.1\nApplicant is a 36-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor.\nHe graduated from college in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer\nscience. He married his first wife in 1998 and they divorced in 2000. He does not know\nher current address. He remarried in 2002. He and his second wife separated in 2006\nand are divorced. He has no children.2\nIn 1989 when a high school student, the police arrested Applicant and charged\nhim with grand larceny for stealing and forging government payroll checks and using a\nVISA credit card. The State dropped the charges. Because his criminal conduct\noccurred shortly after his sister committed suicide, he sought and received counseling.3\nAt Christmas time in 2002, Applicant stole sports cards at a local store during\ndifficult times. The police arrested and charged him with petit larceny. The court found\nhim guilty, sentenced him to 10 days in jail, suspended the sentence and fined him.\nApplicant acknowledges that his conduct was wrong. Shortly after this incident, medical\nprofessionals diagnosed him with depression. He currently takes medication for his\ndepression and leads a normal life.4\nFollowing the break-up of his second marriage, Applicant, in June 2006, drank\nfour beers in an hour while at a local bar with friends. He left the bar and started driving\nhis car home. The police stopped him. They performed a field sobriety test, which he\nfailed. The police arrested him and then searched his car, where they found two ecstacy\npills. The police charged him with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), a misdemeanor,\nand possession of a controlled substance, a class 5 felony. His blood alcohol level\nmeasured .14. He entered into a plea agreement with the State. At his hearing in March\n2007, he pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance and withdrew his appeal of\nthe DUI. The court sentenced him to 90 days on the DUI, suspended the sentence,\nfined him $250, assessed him costs of $238, ordered him to attend an alcohol and\nsubstance abuse program (ASAP), and restricted his driving privileges for one year,\nuntil March 8, 2008. On the possession of the controlled substance charge, the court\nassessed him costs of $506, placed him on one year of supervised probation which will\nend on March 8, 2008, suspended and restricted his driving privileges for six months,\nending on September 9, 2007, and deferred disposition of his case until March 10,\n\nItem 5 (Court records) 2-8; Item 6 (Answers to Interrogatories) at 4-5.\n5\nResponse to FORM at 1; Item 2, supra note 1, at 3; Item 6, supra note 5, at 5-6.\n6\n3\n2008. Applicant paid the fines and costs. At the end of his probation, the drug\npossession charge should be removed from his record.5\nApplicant adamantly denies any drug use and any knowledge that the ecstasy\npills were in his car. He attributes the two ecstasy pills found in his car to his second\nwife. He no longer drinks alcohol and does not intend to do so in the future. He has\nbecome active in his church and provides services to the community through his church.\nHe acknowledges that his decision to drive after drinking was misguided. He completed\nthe ASAP program, stating that he passed the random drug tests. He has not provided\nevidence to support this statement or that he completed the ASAP program.6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge must apply the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions may be applicable in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation;\nApplicant has been arrested three times in the last 18 years, twice for stealing\nand once for DUI and possession of a controlled substance. He is currently on probation\nfor the drug possession charge. Thus, these disqualifying conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following\nmitigating conditions may apply in this case:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\n5\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s arrest for forgery and stealing occurred more than 18 years ago. His\nsister had committed suicide not long before he committed these crimes. He wisely\nsought counseling to deal with the issues of his sister\u2019s death and his resulting criminal\nconduct. Since this date, he has never forged any documents. AG \u00b6 32 (a) has partial\napplicability. \nApplicant, however, stole again five years ago. While both actions are remote in\ntime, the fact that he again resorted to stealing 13 years after his arrest in high school\nraises questions about his trustworthiness and judgment. \nApplicant denies any drug use, despite his arrest for possession of a controlled\nsubstance. The court deferred disposition on the controlled substance charge, but\nsentenced him on the DUI charge. Because he remains on probation for the drug\npossession charge, has not provided any evidence that he has passed his drugs tests,\nand not enough time has passed, he has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline J.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe government alleges that AG \u00b6 16 (c) disqualifying condition applies in this\ncase:\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\n\n6\nFor this disqualifying condition to apply, the record must contain credible adverse\ninformation which is insufficient for adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, a condition precedent. The record contains credible adverse information\nwhich could support an adverse determination under another adjudicative guideline.\nSince I reached an adverse determination under Guideline J, there is no need to reach\na second determination on the same allegations under AG \u00b6 16 (c) of Guideline E. Even\nif the record contains evidence sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition, my\nreasoning for the adverse decision under Guideline J on the same issues applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s behavior as a high\nschool student following his sister\u2019s suicide occurred many years ago. His decision to\nseek counseling after his arrest in 1989 showed mature judgment and a willingness to\naddress his conduct.\nIn recent years, he has shown some serious lapses in judgment. His decision to\nsteal sports cards in 2002 when he was in difficult times raises questions about his\nability to handle adverse situations. He was 31 years old, not a high school student. He\nknew stealing was wrong, but he chose to steal. He showed a second lapse of judgment\nwhen he drove his car after drinking heavily. While he attributes the presence of ecstasy\nin his car to his second wife, he agreed to plead guilty to the drug possession charge.\nHe has not completed his probationary period. In viewing his conduct in the last five\nyears, Applicant has not demonstrated good decision making, which raises questions\nabout his judgment.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                                       \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on January 17, 2008, admitted both allegations,\nand requested a hearing. On April 9, 2008, I was assigned the case. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 13, 2008 scheduling the case for June 5, 2008. At the hearing,\nI received three government exhibits and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. I\nreceived the transcript on June 16, 2008. After thoroughly reviewing the record, I\nconclude that eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n2\nProcedural Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 1.b alleges that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 disqualifies Applicant, by\nvirtue of having served more than one year resulting from a criminal conviction, from\nhaving a security clearance granted or renewed. On January 1, 2008, the day after the\nSOR\u2019s issuance, Public Law 110-81, \u00a7 3002 repealed 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. At the hearing,\nthe government moved to withdraw SOR subparagraph 1.b. I granted the motion.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old married man with two toddler-age children. For the\npast two and a half years, he has worked for a defense contractor as an instructor in the\nsubmersible fiber optics field. According to his company\u2019s security officer, he is an\nexcellent employee who performs arduous tasks \u201cwithout complaint,\u201d and has recently\nbeen recommended for a promotion (Tr. 39). He is currently pursuing an associate\u2019s\ndegree in business administration (Tr. 33).\nApplicant was a troubled teenager who abused alcohol and marijuana, and he\ncommitted a number of crimes with a group of friends (Tr. 21). In September 1996,\nApplicant and three friends robbed a convenience store (Tr. 22). One of the friends\nbrandished a fake handgun during the robbery. They were later arrested and charged.\nApplicant pleaded guilty to second degree robbery and displaying a firearm\n(Answer). He was sentenced to seven years incarceration and ordered to pay\nrestitution. He appealed the length of the sentence, and it was reduced to three and a\nhalf years of incarceration. While in prison, Applicant attended six months of drug and\nalcohol counseling, and a victims\u2019 awareness class (Tr. 26). Also, he actively\nparticipated in Bible study. He paid restitution through a garnishment of wages earned\nin prison. The record contains no evidence of the type of work he performed while in\nprison.\nSince Applicant\u2019s release, he has \u201cengrossed himself with keeping busy\u201d (Tr. 28).\nFrom 2000 to 2006, he worked for two non-profit organizations dedicated to assisting\ndisabled people with life-skills management. His work particularly focused on helping\nautistic people. During this time, his duties also included coordinating the donation of\ncribs to needy families. Since leaving prison, Applicant also volunteered with\nAmericorps, building housing for the underprivileged, and raking leaves at the homes of\nthe elderly.\nApplicant has been married since 2003. He owns his home and rents another.\nAlso, he operates a weekend business with his wife selling organic dog biscuits. He has\nhad no contact with his old troublemaking friends since his incarceration.\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b630). Moreover, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d\n(Id.). Here, Applicant\u2019s 1996 arrest, conviction, and incarceration triggers the application\nof AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime . . .\u201d. \nApplicant committed the crime 12 years ago when he was 17 years old. He\nfulfilled the requirements of his sentence, and has not committed any more criminal\noffenses since then. He no longer associates with the people with whom he associated\nbefore the conviction, and does not use marijuana or abuse alcohol, as he did when he\nwas a teenager. Since leaving prison, he has developed a solid employment record,\nenrolled in college, began raising a family, and participated in constructive volunteer\nactivities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\n\n4\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement,\u201d both apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s crime is outweighed by his immaturity\nat the time, and the reform and rehabilitation he has demonstrated since then.\nApplicant\u2019s commitment to his family, his job, and his community render the possibility\nof recurrence minimal. I conclude his 1996 arrest and conviction no longer pose a\nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.\n.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nWITHDRAWN\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all but two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 2.c.) in his answer to the SOR, and offered explanations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 40 years old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor since January 2005 working as a materiel coordinator. He was arrested in March 2002 and charged with DWI and speeding. He pled guilty. He was fined with his license suspended for six months, placed on unsupervised probation, required to participate in alcohol screening, and ordered to attend DWI school. In March 2005 he was arrested and charged with aggravated DWI and possession of cocaine in an open container which he had just purchased in a bar For $20. He was found guilty of the first charge and was sentenced to 179 days in jail with all but seven suspended. He was fined, placed on supervised probation and ordered to complete community service. He attended DWI school, a victim impact panel, and moral reconation therapy. Applicant pled guilty to the drug charge. He was fined, placed on 128 months probation, and ordered to complete community service. Several other minor charges were dismissed. Applicant used cocaine at least once in 2005 and possibly more often while holding a security clearance. In November 2005, he tested positive for cocaine while serving on probation for the 2005 drug conviction (Exh. 4, p. 10). In January 2006 he was diagnosed with alcohol and dr",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 19, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires For \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines H, G, E, and J.  \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \nJune 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on \nFebruary 27, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of \na hearing. Documents were attached to the answer with explanatory information. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 2, 2008, was provided \nto him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided an additional statement on April \n21, 2008. The case was assigned to me on May 3, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all but two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 2.c.) in his answer to \nthe SOR, and offered explanations. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor \nsince January 2005 working as a materiel coordinator.  He was arrested in March 2002 \nand charged with DWI and speeding. He pled guilty. He was fined with his license \nsuspended for six months, placed on unsupervised probation, required to participate in \nalcohol screening, and ordered to attend DWI school.  \n \n \nIn March 2005 he was arrested and charged with aggravated DWI and \npossession of cocaine in an open container which he had just purchased in a bar For \n$20. He was found guilty of the first charge and was sentenced to 179 days in jail with \nall but seven suspended.  He was fined, placed on supervised probation and ordered to \ncomplete community service. He attended DWI school, a victim impact panel, and moral \nreconation therapy. Applicant pled guilty to the drug charge. He was fined, placed on \n128 months probation, and ordered to complete community service. Several other minor \ncharges were dismissed.  \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine at least once in 2005 and possibly more often while \nholding a security clearance. In November 2005, he tested positive for cocaine while \nserving on probation for the 2005 drug conviction (Exh. 4, p. 10). In January 2006 he \nwas diagnosed with alcohol and drug abuse. He received treatment at a counseling \ncenter for nine months for alcohol and cocaine abuse.  He has not used drugs since his \nrelease. However, he continues to drink beer, the beverage he drank to excess, \nincluding an estimated 24 beers on a weekend, when the DWI offenses occurred (Exh. \n6, p. 7).  \n \n \nApplicant has attempted to change his conduct since his last drug and alcohol \nuse and his arrests. He states that the last offenses occurred when he was 37 years of \nage and that he has matured in the past three years. He offered no evidence to support \nthe assertion.  \n \n  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered For access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that the following Adudicative Guidelines provide the standard for \nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes several conditions that could be applicable to this matter, raise \na security concern, and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of   \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant admitted use of cocaine at least once and possibly more often while \nholding a security clearance. While he states his intent not to use drugs and was in drug \ntreatment and completed treatment, he did not submit any documentation concerning a \nfavorable prognosis or other evidence required in the mitigating conditions. For the 2005 \noffense, he served seven days in jail and was on probation for 18 months during which \ntime he used cocaine.  \n \n \nThe drug use and possession offenses occurred almost three years ago but in \nview of the circumstances of the offenses and his use occurred while holding a security \nclearance, it is premature to apply the relevant mitigating conditions.  \n  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes the following conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; and \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following several conditions that may be applicable and \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant has used alcohol to excess and has been charged and found guilty of \nDWI in 2002 and 2005. While he avers that he only drinks socially, he stated in a \nresponse in October, 2007 that he would continue to drink beer, the drink that caused \nhis DWI arrests. He has shown none of the evidence required to justify application of \nthe mitigating conditions.  \n  \nGuideline E Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline For Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to have failed to report fully in two answers to Question 28 on \nhis application for a security clearance the full extent of his drug use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. This prompted security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b). He \nanswered in the affirmative to the questions and did report specifically one use in 2005. \nHe later admitted to several drug uses (Exh. 4), but now disputes the allegation in his \nlast submission.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides that Applicant could mitigate security concerns from the \nfacts in this case. It is that if the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nSince he did report one use while holding a security clearance and the \nrequirement in the guideline is that the omission be deliberate, I find that the omission \nalleged was not deliberate. Security concerns pertaining to personal conduct are \nmitigated. \n \nGuideline J Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n \n \nThe allegations under this guideline repeat the first two allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1. and 2. and the two allegations under SOR \u00b6 3. Since they have all been discussed in \nthe earlier sections of the decisions, the same findings will be made under this \nguideline.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c) provides that \u201can allegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted\u201d is a disqualifying condition. Applicant was arrested for two DWI offenses in \n2002 and 2005. He was found guilty and sentenced. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provide two conditions that could be applicable and mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAlthough almost three years has elapsed since the last offenses, they all related \nto alcohol-induced behavior and Applicant continues to use alcohol. Therefore, there is \ninsufficient evidence of rehabilitation and it is premature at this time to apply the \nmitigating conditions. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions previously discussed through application of the whole person concept. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug, alcohol, and criminal allegations.  He has made \nsome progress in changing his conduct but the conduct alleged occurred when he was \n36 years old so it cannot be attributed to youthful indiscretions.  \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting \nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or For Applicant on the allegations set Forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: AGAINSTAPPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  Against Applicant  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                Paragraph 3, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 3.a.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b.:  For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a.:  Against Applicant as to \nParagraphs 1 and 2 but not as to Paragraph 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

DOHA recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 4, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 15, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nMarch 5, 2008.  A hearing was held on March 5, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and six exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on March 18, 2008.\nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been  arrested, charged, or cited\nwith five alcohol-related offenses between 1985 and January 2004.  Those five offenses\nare as follows: (1) in September 1985 for Operating Under the Influence/ intoxication of\nLiquor; (2) in February 2002 for public intoxication, for which he was fined $115.00, (3)\nin October 2003 for Driving Under the Influence (DuI), for which he pled guilty and was\nsentenced to two years deferred sentence, fined, placed on probation, and ordered to\npay for probation supervision ($20.00 a month), as well as a $25.00 deferred sentence\nfee, (4) in December 2003 for Actual Physical Control of Motor Vehicle, for which he\npled nolo contendre and was sentenced to one year in jail (suspended),  required to\nattend a victims impact meeting, and fined $762.00, and (5) in January 2004 for\nresisting executive officer and DuI-Liquor or Drugs/Actual Physical control of Vehicle, for\nwhich he pled nolo contrendre and was sentenced to a year in jail (suspended), ordered\nto attend a victim\u2019s impact panel meeting, and fined $250.00.\nAdditionally, under Guideline G, applicant is alleged to (a) have received medical\ntreatment/counseling between April 1999 and May 1999 at an alcohol rehabilitation\ncenter, and (b) continued to consume alcohol as of October 2007.  \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance\napplication (SF-86) of May 2005 by omitting (a) all but his December alcohol-related\narrest, (b) his treatment/counseling for alcohol abuse in 1999, and \u00a9) his reported tax\nlien in October 1998. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the of the allegations.\nwithout any explanations.  He denied his January 2004 alcohol-related offense and any\nattempts to falsify his 2005 SF-86.\nFindings of Fact\n        Applicant is a 48 year-old aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children (R.T., at 36).  During his six years of\nactive duty in the Navy (between 1978 and 1984), he received extensive training in\naviation maintenance and was awarded certificates honoring his demonstrated\nprofessionalism (see ex. E).  Applicant was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1984\n(see ex. C).\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol at a very early age (estimated 5 to 6).\nBefore April 1999, he typically drank on a nightly basis, consuming 2 to 3 beers at a\nsitting (R.T., at 73-74), oft-drinking to intoxication (at least once a week).  His drink of\nchoice was beer; although, he sometimes consumed tequila as well (R.T., at 74-75).\nApplicant considered intoxication to be the rough equivalent of falling down drunk (R.T.,\nat 75).  Occasionally, he drank and drive (R.T., at 76).  \n\n3\nBetween 1985 and January 2004, Applicant was involved in five separate\nalcohol-related incidents.  In September 1985, he was arrested for operating a motor\nvehicle under the influence/intoxication of liquor.  He had consumed three beers in a\nlocal residence before the incident, and was on his way home when stopped by police\n(R.T., at 43-44).  Applicant assures that his brother was actually driving the vehicle.  But\nbecause his brother did not have a drivers license, Applicant told the arresting officer\nthat he was the driver (R.T., at 44-45).  Applicant believes he was administered a\nBreathalyzer test at the scene, but could not remember what it registered. While\nApplicant believed the charges were dropped (R.T., at 46), he could provide no\ndocumentation of the disposition of the case.   Case disposition remains uncertain.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s own statements, though, the incident qualifies as an alcohol-\nrelated offense even without a documented conviction. \nApplicant was arrested in February 2002 for public intoxication. He had\nconsumed a six-pack of beers over a 4 to 5 hour period at a local residence with his\ngirlfriend and drove to his girlfriend\u2019s home to drop her off (R.T., at 48-50).  She went to\nthe wrong apartment door when they arrived at her place of residence.  Applicant tried\nthe key and when it did not work, he kicked in the front door to the apartment (R.T., at\n47-49).  When the police arrived, they escorted him to the station. Applicant later pled\nguilty to public intoxication and was fined $115.00. (R.T., at 51-53).\nIn October 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with DuI. He had\nconsumed several beers before his arrest and was speeding when he was stopped by\npolice (R.T., at 54-55).  Once arrested, he was handcuffed and taken to jail, where he\nspent the night.  When he appeared in court, he pled guilty to the charged offense.  He\nwas sentenced to two years in jail (deferred), fined $150.00 plus $600.00 in court costs,\nplaced on probation, and ordered to pay a $20.00 a month supervision fee and a $25.00\na month deferred sentence fee.  \nApplicant was arrested again in December 2003 on an alcohol-related offense.\nBefore his arrest, Applicant had consumed several shots of tequila and four to five\nbeers (R.T., at 58-59).   He was sitting in his parked vehicle when confronted by the\narresting officer at the scene.  Applicant\u2019s verbal exchange with the officer evolved into\na scuffle, in which Applicant suffered two broken ribs (R.T., at 60-61).  While in the\npolice car in transit to a local hospital, Applicant complained that the officer was\nphysically hurting him (see ex. 2; R.T., at 61).  Without a police report, it is not possible\nto verify these complaints and disposition.  After spending about two weeks in the\nhospital for treatment of his broken ribs, the same transporting officer returned and\narrested/charged Applicant (in January 2004) and transported him to the county jail\nwhere he booked and charged Applicant with the offense of actual physical control of a\nmotor vehicle and transported (R.T., at 61-62).  Once in court, Applicant pled nolo\ncontendre and was sentenced to one year (suspended), fined $762.00, and required to\nattend a victim\u2019s impact meeting (R.T., at 62).  Applicant\u2019s claim that his December\n2003 arrest is one and the same as the January arrest alleged in sub-paragraph 1.e of\nthe SOR is sufficiently corroborated by the FBI investigation report (ex. 3; R.T., at 64-\n66) to warrant acceptance.  \nConcerned about his drinking, which had caused him some problems at work\n(R.T., at 81-82), Applicant sought treatment for his perceived alcohol problem in April\n\n4\n1999 (R.T., at 67).  He voluntarily admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation center (H\nCenter) in April 1999. During his 26-day inpatient stay in this facility, Applicant was\ncounseled and treated for his alcohol problem.  His group activities included the center\u2019s\n12-step program (R.T., at 68, 77).  Both Applicant and his brother claim to be alcoholics\n(see ex. D; R.T., at 69-70).  Neither, though, provides any documented medical\ninformation confirming their alcohol dependence condition.  And Applicant simply has no\nrecollection of ever being advised by hospital staff of any dependent or abuse diagnosis\n(R.T., at 70-72). Before he was discharged, the center\u2019s staff did suggest he quit\ndrinking altogether and attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings (R.T., at 72-73).  \nFollowing his May 1999 discharge from H Center, Applicant did curtail his\ndrinking to about a six-pack a week (R.T., at 78).  However, he did not give up drinking\nas recommended by H Center\u2019s staff and  never pursued AA participation following his\ninpatient discharge. Because Applicant\u2019s treatment records have not been made\navailable, it is not possible to determine his rendered drinking diagnosis (if any) by H\nCenter professional counselors.  Since December 2003, Applicant estimates he\nreduced his alcohol consumption rate to about 2 to 3 beers a week (R.T., at 78) and\nmaintained this basic rate of consumption through 2007.\nApplicant has not enrolled in any other alcohol treatment programs since his May\n1999 discharge from H Center and has no plans to do so (R.T., at 80).  He does not\nconsider his attendance at a victims impact meeting to constitute alcohol treatment\n(R.T., at 80).  While he assures that he has abstained from alcohol use since January\n2008, and commits to future abstinence, he provides no witness or documentary\nsupport for his assurances.  Applicant\u2019s older brother (who has been an AA sponsor\nhimself) credits Applicant with joining AA\u2019s 12-step program and committing to\nremaining sober with the help of the program\u2019s active recovery principles (see ex. D;\nR.T., at 79-82).  Describing him as an alcoholic like himself, the brother provides no\naccount, though, of Applicant\u2019 past drinking practices.\nAsked to complete an SF-86 in may 2005, Applicant omitted three of his four\nalcohol-related arrests (listing only his December 2003 arrest when responding to\nquestion 24 of the questionnaire.  He attributes this arrest omissions to memory lapse\nand his belief that the arrests would not appear in his record (see ex. 2; R.T., at 84-85).\nIn the same SF-86, Applicant omitted his inpatient treatment with H Center in 1999.\nWhen answering question 30.  He attributes this omission, too, to memory lapse (R.T.,\nat 85).  Besides his alcohol-related omissions, Applicant omitted a state tax lien from his\nSF-86, when responding to a question (question 36) covering this subject matter.\nApplicant attributes this omission to his lack of knowledge at the time of any tax liens\nfiled against his property interests (R.T., at 86). \nWhen interviewed by an OPM investigator in March 2006 (see ex. 2), Applicant\nacknowledged the arrests he could recall when specifically asked about them by the\ninvestigator (R.T.,at 98-100).  Albeit, he could not recall being asked about his treatment\n(R.T.,at 99). \nWithout more to tie in his omission explanations with the actual questions\ncovering his alcohol arrests and treatment episodes, his explanations are not\nconvincing.  The questions themselves are straight forward and ask for details covering\n\n5\nany alcohol-related arrests and treatment admissions. To misread arrest history and\ntreatment-related questions so completely places too much strain on credibility limits.\nAcceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanations require more corroborative proof of a good-faith\nmisapprehension of the questions posed in each questionnaire than Applicant was able\nto provide.  \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for omitting his state tax lien are consistent with his\nprevious denials of any knowledge of the lien and credible enough to warrant their\nacceptance (see ex. 2).  He documents his subsequent satisfaction of the state\u2019s tax\nlien in January 2007 once he learned of the lien from reviewing his credit report (see ex.\nF; R.T., at 86).  Without any more developed information on this tax lien and how and\nwhen it came to be filed, there is not enough information at hand to impute knowledge\nto Applicant of the existence of the lien when he completed the SF-86 in issue.\nAccordingly, favorable inferences warrant with respect to his tax lien omission.\nApplicant is well regarded by his superiors and coworkers (see ex. D).  They find\nhim to be a reliable aircraft mechanic who conscientious about his work (ex. D).  He has\nnumerous certificates that document his successful completion of aircraft maintenance\ntraining with his employer in 1999 (see ex. E).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\n      \u201cThe Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 21).\nPersonal Conduct\n    \u201cThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\n\n6\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 15).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\n       Applicant is an honorably discharged military veteran with a history of regular\nalcohol consumption over a 20-year period and four established alcohol-related\nincidents between 1985 and 2004.  Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents and\ncontinued consumption in the face of inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in 1999,\nreflects both a recent pattern of alcohol abuse outside the work place and a potential\nabuse or dependency problem that raise security concerns.  Additional security\nconcerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of most of his alcohol-related arrests\nand treatment referral in his answers to a security clearance application in May 2005. \nOf some initial security concern, but still largely unsubstantiated, is Applicant\u2019s omission\nof a state tax lien filed against him in October 1998.\nAlcohol issues\nOn the strength of the evidence presented, one of the available disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption is clearly\napplicable: DC 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\n\n7\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d under the facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\nsituation.\nApplicant\u2019s drinking history, that includes four alcohol-related incidents and one\ninpatient treatment stay at a recognized substance abuse facility, reflects problem\ndrinking over a considerable period of time.  Even though he does not recall receiving a\ndiagnosis of either alcohol dependence or abuse, his belief that he had a potential\nalcohol dependence problem is what prompted him to seek treatment from H Center in\n1999.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s H Center treatment had some positive influence initially on his\ndrinking practices, he soon resumed regular drinking and maintained this drinking\npattern for the ensuing ten years.  During this ten year stretch between 1998 and 2008,\nhe experienced three additional alcohol-related arrests, for which he was convicted, and\nat times consumed alcohol beyond recognized legal limits. This combination of\ncontinuous abusive drinking over a extensive period of time that manifested in a series\nof alcohol-related offenses (four proven ones altogether) and a treatment admission\njustify assigning some application to DC 22\u00a9), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol\nto the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nBecause Applicant could not recall receiving a dependence or abuser diagnosis\nfrom his H Center providers, he continued to drink and avoid his recommended AA\nattendance until recently.  His failure to seek a current diagnosis and prognosis from\nany qualified substance abuse provider and/or enlist substance abuse counseling to\ndate, warrants limited application of any of the mitigating conditions covered by the\nGuidelines for alcohol.  Favorable views from his coworkers and brother about his\nrecent commitments to sobriety through AA\u2019s 12-step program, while helpful, are not\nenough to mitigate alcohol concerns under any of the covered mitigating conditions.\nWhole person assessment does not alter risk concerns associated with\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol-related offenses and still recent drinking patterns in the\naftermath of his H Center treatment and recurrent drinking over the past nine years.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol evaluations by qualified clinicians and his corresponding failure to\neither mount a successful challenge to the abstinence/AA recommendations of his\ntreatment counselors until just recently prevent safe predictive judgments about his\nability to sustain his current abstinence commitments. \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant failed to make a convincing\nshowing that he has both the maturity and seasoned resource support to avert any\nrecurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  There is insufficient\nevidence to warrant safe assessments that he is no longer at risk of judgment\nimpairment associated with his past alcohol-related conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d and 1.f and 1.g of the SOR.\nApplicant is entitled to favorable conclusions with respect to sub-paragraph 1.e based\non Applicant\u2019s probative showing that subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e cover the same\nDecember 2003 alcohol-related arrest.\n\n8\nSF-86 omissions\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list all of his of his alcohol-related arrests and past alcohol\ntreatment in his 2005 SF-86.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see\nclassified information that the margins for excusing candor lapses are necessarily\nnarrow.\nBy omitting his 1985, 2002 and October 2003 arrests and 1999 inpatient\ntreatment at H Center in his 2005 SF-86, Applicant concealed materially important\nbackground information needed by the government to properly process and evaluate his\nsecurity updates.  His claims of memory lapses lack credible plausibility. So, weighing\nall of the circumstances surrounding his SF-86 omissions, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the\nnecessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions he deliberately withheld\nmaterial background information about the extent of his arrest history.  Only his\nexplanation for his omitted acknowledgment of his 1998 state tax lien is sufficiently\nconvincing to justify conclusions that the allegation is unsubstantiated. \nWhat is clear about the alcohol-related questions involved in Applicant\u2019s 2005\nSF-86 is that they contain no time qualifications and could not plausibly be misread or\neasily forgotten.  Applicant\u2019s omissions require application of a disqualifying condition\n(DC) for personal conduct of the Guidelines: 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, because his omissions are neither\nisolated nor followed by prompt and good faith corrections of his omissions.  Under\nthese circumstances, he cannot claim the benefit of any of the potentially applicable\nmitigating conditions.  Not only has the Appeal Board found the use of the predecessor\nto mitigating condition (MC) 17\u00a9) (which is A5.1.3.2) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for\npersonal conduct (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as\nisolated, but it has denied applicants availability of MC 17(a) and its predecessor\nmitigating condition (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d).  Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289\n(January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January1995).\n \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to sub-paras. 2.a and 2.b of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\n        In light  of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 19, 2006.\nOn October 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F\n(Financial) and E (Personal Conduct) for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 10, and 17, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on December 26, 2007, and I received the case assignment on\nJanuary 3, 2008. 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, for a\nhearing on January 29, 2008 and I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered three exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted\nin evidence without objection. Applicant submitted 26 exhibits which were admitted\nwithout objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nuntil March 3, 2007, to submit additional evidence but none was received. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice and indicated he was\nready to proceed (Tr. 6). \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting the two allegations\nunder Guideline E (Personal Conduct) for falsification of information on his SF 86\nrelating to delinquent debts (Tr. 7). Department Counsel showed that the allegation was\nin error upon examination of the SF 86 dated July 19, 2006. The motion was granted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted fourteen of the sixteen allegations\nin the SOR relating to approximately $29,000 in delinquent debts. He denied the other\ntwo allegations. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a government contractor working in\nshipyards since 2006. He began as a power washer for another contractor in June\n2006. In September 2006 he was hired by his present employer as a welder with\nimproved pay. He has held a security clearance for most of the time of his current\nemployment.\nApplicant served in the Navy for almost four years as an operations specialist\nfrom the time of his high school graduation in 1991 until 1995 when he was discharged\nat age 22. He lived on the west and gulf coasts for approximately ten years. The first\ntwo or three years was with a significant other. During that time most of his debts\n\n3\naccumulated. Upon breaking up that relationship, he was responsible for credit card\ndebts and purchases the two of them had made. He also had legal bills for a paternity\nsuit of over $4,000 in 2001 (Exh. 10). During a large part of that ten year period, he was\nemployed in the fast food business at low wages. He is now married with three children\nages 8, 4, and 3. \nApplicant returned to his childhood home on the east coast in 2006 to be near his\nfamily. He was unemployed for a period of three months which further complicated his\nfinancial problems. His father, who works at the same facility with him, helped him with\nhis financial problems and has been repaid (Tr. 38). Since obtaining his present\nemployment, he has done well in his work and is favorably regarded by his corporate\nsupervisor who supports his effort to obtain a security clearance (Exh. 26). His current\nannual salary is approximately $52,000 but that is based on travel assignments when\nhe receives additional pay. When he does not travel his pay is lower (Tr. 25). He needs\na security clearance to be able to travel because the work he does requires access to\nsecure facilities. When he is employed with extra travel pay he has approximately\n$1,400 left over at the end of the month after expenses (Tr. 30). His wife has not been\nemployed since moving to the east coast but is starting work and will be making around\n$700 a month in hourly wages (Tr. 25. \nApplicant\u2019s service in the Navy in a demanding job was considered outstanding\nby his ship\u2019s captain (Exh. 8). His former private employers regarded his work as\nexceptional for his dedication and long hours of service (Exhs. 9 and 10).\nThe status of the delinquent debts is as follows: \nHalf of the 16 alleged delinquent debts have been paid and half have not. Eight\nof the debts totaling $6,000 have been settled or paid in full. Three were paid before the\nSOR was issued. One in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) for $180 (Exh. 17), a second in October\n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.) for $1,283 was paid by a credit card, and a third in September 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.o.) for $318 (Exh. 12). \nThe other five were paid in November 2007 after the SOR was issued. They are\n(SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.b. (Exh. 16), h.(Exh. 13), i. (Exh. 13 and 15), l. (Exh. 14),and n.(Exh. 13).\nMost of them were paid from the proceeds of a $4,800 loan from a credit union which he\nis repaying in monthly installments. \nThe remaining eight delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 c.-g., j., m., and p.) are for credit\ncards and constitute most of the larger debts totaling almost $25,000. They range in\namounts from $1,334 to $5,386. Applicant intends to pay all of them and has been in\ncontact with most of the creditors. However, several of the creditors are unwilling to\ndiscuss settlement and insist on full payment (Tr. 22, 23). As a result he is contacting\nthem sequentially in an effort to settle them one at a time when he has sufficient funds\nto pay each of them. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information.  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts and was unable to pay\nthe obligations for a long period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems arose between 1995 and 2006. He now has a job which pays a\nreasonable salary and his wife is employed. It seems likely that he will be able to\nresolve the debts over time but a large number with large amounts remain unsatisfied.\nWhile he has excellent references and the support of his employer, the remaining\ndelinquent debts does raise security concerns under the Guideline F.\nUnder AG & 20(b), the security concern may be mitigating where Athe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@\nAs noted above, some of the financial problems arose from his periods of\nunemployment and low pay, the breakup with his significant other ten years ago leaving\nhim with debts, and the move back to his hometown and a delay until he could find\nemployment. He did resolve a few of the debts before the SOR was issued but most\nwere after the issuance. It appears that most of these debts were paid with proceeds\nfrom a loan which must still be repaid. He has repaid his father for a loan during the\nperiod before obtaining his present employment. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\n\n6\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and the delinquent\ndebts have not been resolved either by payment or settlement. While some of them\nhave been resolved, the vast majority of the total dollar amount has not been. While it\nnot necessary for mitigation to apply that all of the delinquent debts be resolved, it is\nnecessary that a significant portion of this many debts in this amount be settled or paid.\nThe fact that most of those that have been resolved are the smaller debts and that they\nwere resolved by a loan that must be re-paid, does not satisfy the requirements for\nmitigation. Thus, I conclude that the mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young man in his early 20's (See AG & 2(a)(4). He accumulated debt\nduring periods of low wages (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Since that time, Applicant has moved,\nand has a better paying job. He is married and has three children. As a result, he has\nfocused his attention on providing a stable domestic environment for his family. He has\na record of commendable duty performance during military service in a responsible\nposition. Although he has taken action to pay or resolve some of the smaller delinquent\ndebts, the majority in dollar amounts are yet unresolved. (See AG & 2(a)(6).)\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time. I recognize his interest and\nefforts to resolve these financial issues and that, if he does not have a clearance with\nthe opportunity to earn a higher income, it will take longer to resolve the debts.\nHowever, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\nthese financial considerations and that it is premature at this time to grant a security\nclearance. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. :For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n____________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40 year old employee of a defense contractor. In 1994, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. She was convicted of the charge. In January 2005, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. When the alleged victim did not appear in court, the charge was dismissed. In May 2005, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. In July 2005, she was charged with Failure to Appear. Both charges were dismissed in September 2005. In January 2006, applicant was charged with (1) Assault and Battery and (2) Profane Swearing or Intoxicated. In April 2006, she was found guilty of both charges, given a six month suspended sentence, and fined about $400.00. On January 12, 2007, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery on a Family Member. In April 2007, the charge was dismissed. Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on January 31, 2007.

Crowley, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 2, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn January 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 11, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 20, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn 1994, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. She was convicted of\nthe charge.\nIn January 2005, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. When the\nalleged victim did not appear in court, the charge was dismissed.\nIn May 2005, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery. In July 2005, she\nwas charged with Failure to Appear. Both charges were dismissed in September 2005.\nIn January 2006, applicant was charged with (1) Assault and Battery and (2)\nProfane Swearing or Intoxicated. In April 2006, she was found guilty of both charges,\ngiven a six month suspended sentence, and fined about $400.00.\nOn January 12, 2007, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery on a\nFamily Member. In April 2007, the charge was dismissed.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on January 31, 2007. In response to Question 23.c., which asked: \u201cAre there\ncurrently any charges pending against you for any criminal offense?\u201d applicant\nresponded \u201cno.\u201d This response was false because, as noted above, she had been\ncharged with a crime on January 12, 2007, and the charge was not dismissed until April\n2007. In her response to the SOR, applicant admitted the SOR allegation that she\nfalsified material facts on the e-QIP, but stated she \u201cwas not aware of charges at that\ntime.\u201d Given the fact she told an OPM investigator that, on the day of the alleged crime,\nshe had been (1) brought to the police station, (2) \u201ccharged and processed for Assault\nand Battery,\u201d (3) given a court date, and (4) \u201cbonded out by her friend,\u201d it is clear she\nknew a charge was pending against her when she completed the e-QIP (Exhibits 2 and\n6).\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\n\n3\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple arrests and two\nconvictions for Assault and Battery raise these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\n\n4\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false\nmaterial information on the e-QIP.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who,\nsince 1994, has been arrested five times and convicted twice of Assault and Battery.\nShe offered little to no evidence that would suggest this type of behavior is unlikely to\ncontinue. Based on these facts, and the fact she intentionally concealed from the\nGovernment her most recent Assault and Battery charge when she completed the e-\nQIP in 2007, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuidelines E and J.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 5, 2007, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n2 \n \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 30, 2007. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on December 10, 2007. As of \nJanuary 24, 2008, she had not responded. I received the case assignment on January \n28, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 63 years old. She attended college for a period of time but did not \ngraduate. She is divorced with two adult children.1 Applicant has an extensive amount \nof delinquent debt. Individual debts are addressed below.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a state tax lien of $1,760 filed in 1995, for unpaid individual \ntaxes, interest and/or penalties due for tax year 1992.

She also admitted to a debt of $7,848 to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The debts are reported on the CBRs in the \nFORM. There is no evidence that either debt has been paid.5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt of $6,948 to a financial institution. Applicant stated that \n\u201c[d]ue to the charge-off [she] was under the impression that the debt was satisfied.\u201d The \nCBRs list this debt to a financial institution and include the name of the financial \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 3, 7, 9 \n \n3 Items 3, 9. \n \n4 Items 3, 5, 7, 9. \n \n5 Items 3, 7, 9. \n \n\n3 \n \ninstitution in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The CBRs also list this debt as transferred or sold.6  I find the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.g to be a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in her response to Interrogatories and in her response to the \nSOR that she fell on hard times. While attempting to keep her body and soul together, \nher financial situation became overwhelming. She provided no additional information as \nto how or why she got into financial trouble. She indicated she had a small amount of \nmoney saved, but that she would lose her job if she received an adverse determination. \nShe was reluctant to use the money to pay her debts, as she would need the money if \nshe became unemployed again. She stated that if she receives a favorable \ndetermination and remains employed, she has every intention of fulfilling her financial \nobligations. She also noted that she has no criminal record.7 \n \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), on \nJune 6, 2006. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 22b, which asked, \u201cAre you now \nover 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or \nobligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d Applicant did have \ndelinquent debts more than 180 days old when she submitted the SF 85P. Question \n22a asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you or a company over which you exercised some \ncontrol, filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had \nlegal judgment rendered against you for a debt?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and listed \nthe 2004 judgment in favor of the financial institution as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant \nalso reported that she left two jobs under unfavorable circumstances. Applicant denied \nintentionally falsifying the questionnaire.8 After considering all the evidence, including \nthe SF 85P which lists adverse financial information, I find Applicant did not intentionally \nfalsify her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions.  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \n                                                          \n6 Id. \n \n7 Items 3, 5. \n \n8 Items 3, 4. \n\n4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \n& 18:       \n \n\n5 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise concerns. Under AG & \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the potential mitigating conditions, \nand especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,@ \nAG & 20(b) Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,@ AG & 20(c) Athe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,@ AG & 20(d) Athe individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,@ and AG & 20(e) \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant paid the two debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e, totaling about $335. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. There is no evidence that \nApplicant paid any of the other debts as alleged in the SOR. The payment of these two \nsmall debts is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant made a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Applicant stated she fell on hard \ntimes, but there is no evidence as to what caused Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Nor is \nthere evidence of financial counseling. I do not find any of the mitigating conditions \napplicable.  \n \n \n Guideline E, Personal Conduct  \n  \nThe concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n6 \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, including AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant omitted information from her Questionnaire for \nPublic Trust Positions; however, it was not a deliberate omission. No Personal Conduct \ndisqualifying condition is raised by the evidence. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Appellant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \n \nThe potential disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d It is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to knowingly and willfully \nmake any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any \nmatter within the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nomission of information on her SF 85P was not knowing or willful. She did not violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and no Criminal Conduct disqualifying condition has been established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \n\n7 \n \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of financial \ndelinquencies. She stated she fell on hard times, but provided no explanation as to what \ncaused her financial problems. She paid two small debts and indicated she would pay \nher other debts if she received a favorable determination and remained employed. She \ndoes not have a criminal record, but she provided very little additional information about \nherself.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial problems.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Susan G. Chappell, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on April 27, 2006. On November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n21, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 25, 2008. \nThe case was transferred to me on February 26, 2008. On March 13, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 15, 2008. The hearing was held, as \nscheduled. The Government offered three exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1-3 without objection. The Applicant offered three exhibits which were \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - C.  Applicant and four witnesses testified. The \ntranscript was received on April 23, 2008. The record closed on that date. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He is a senior engineer and has worked for his current \nemployer since April 2006. He retired from federal employment on March 31, 2006 after \n31 years of service. He has held a security clearance for over 32 years. He served on \nactive duty in the United States Army from August 1969 to August 1971. He received an \nhonorable discharge. He has been married for 31 years and has a son, age 28. (Tr at \n48, 59, 81, 105, 116; Gov 1; Gov 2 at 14-16.)   \n \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s son was arrested and charged with murdering a female \nteenage friend. He pled guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  \nApplicant and his wife have endured a lot of emotional pain as a result of their son\u2019s \nactions and subsequent imprisonment. Applicant started to drink wine in the evenings in \norder to numb his feelings.  When he was drinking he became emotionally distant from \nhis wife. At his heaviest intake, he drank up to two bottles of wine per night. His drinking \ndid not affect his work performance. He still showed up for work and received favorable \nevaluations. (Tr at 86-88; Gov 2 at 8; AE B; Answer to SOR.) His co-workers did not \nnotice that he had a drinking problem. (AE B, Federal Co-worker Interviews.) He has no \nrecent arrests for driving under the influence. He was arrested on one occasion for \ndriving under the influence in May 1973. (Gov 1, section 23; Gov 2 at 8.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was concerned about his drinking and realized her husband was \nstarting to have a problem with alcohol.  She said her husband used alcohol to \u201cdeaden \nthe pain\u201d after their son went to prison.  His drinking cut him off from her. He drank on a \ndaily basis when he got home after work.  The couple sought professional help to cope \nwith their son\u2019s situation.  She asked her husband to quit drinking after she realized he \nwas drinking too much after seeing the therapist. She thought his drinking was making \nhim more depressed. (Tr at 86-92.) \n \nApplicant initially denied that he had a drinking problem. Applicant\u2019s wife \neventually told him to stop drinking or move out of the house. He chose to move out. He \nrented an apartment.  He talked to his wife daily and saw her a couple times a week. A \nfew months after he moved out, Applicant called his wife and asked her to take him to \nthe doctor and to arrange to attend an inpatient alcohol treatment program. She \narranged for him to attend an inpatient treatment program in March 2005. (Tr at 91, 93, \n94; AE B at 68-70.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPrior to departing for the inpatient alcohol treatment program, Applicant talked to \nhis supervisors and told them he had an alcohol problem.  His supervisors were very \nsupportive.  He took leave to attend the inpatient treatment program from March 1, 2005         \nto March 20, 2005. (Tr at 123; AE B at 48, 68-70; Answer to SOR.)   \n \nWhen Applicant began treatment, he spent three to four days in the detoxification \nunit. During this time he did not feel well but had no major physical issues. After \ncompleting detox, he underwent two and a half weeks of intensive inpatient treatment. \nHe learned about the disease of alcoholism while in treatment.  He went home after he \nsuccessfully completed the program. He joined an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) group as \npart of his aftercare, obtained a sponsor and remained sober. After four months of \nsobriety, his wife invited him to move back home. (Tr at 93-96; 122-125.) He celebrated \none year of sobriety in February 2006. (Tr at 126.) \n \nAfter he retired from his federal government job and moved to the location of his \ncurrent employment, he did not stay actively engaged in the AA program.  In July 2006, \nhe decided to drink a beer at the airport after a flight was canceled. He started to think \nthat he could drink socially. He called his wife and told her to pick him up at the airport \nbecause he drank a beer.  After that, he occasionally had a beer or a glass of wine with \ndinner.  His drinking started to escalate in the summer 2007. (Tr at 96-99; 126-128, \n131.) \n \nSometime in August 2007, Applicant called in sick to work and told his supervisor \nthat he was having problems with alcohol and that he needed some time off.  He drank \na couple bottles of wine during the time he was off. (Tr at 136.) After this incident, \nApplicant started to make some changes. He joined a local substance abuse counseling \ngroup. He started to attend AA again and acquired a sponsor. He had two relapses in \nNovember 2007 and on January 23, 2008. Each of these episodes occurred over the \ncourse of an evening. The last time, he drank a full bottle of wine. (Tr at 31-32, \n100,103,132-133.) He disclosed his two relapses to his counselor and his psychologist. \n(Tr at 137-138.) \n \nIn early February 2008, Applicant obtained a new sponsor. He has progressed \nwith his new sponsor. He is more engaged and realizes in order to stay sober he has to \nstay engaged and work the program.  He attends an AA meeting daily and meets with \nhis sponsor at least once a week.  He attends his other group meeting on a weekly \nbasis.  The meetings last 90 minutes. (Tr at 133-134,137.)  Applicant admits he is a \nrecovering alcoholic.  He works the program on a daily basis to keep himself healthy. \n(Tr at 117, 148.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife states that she believes her husband is committed to sobriety. \nShe said it was very meaningful to her that he changed sponsors because he thought \nhis first sponsor was not working out.  It shows her that he is serious about managing \nhis disease (alcoholism). He goes to AA meetings often and is enthusiastic about what \nhe learns during the meetings. Since he has obtained a new sponsor, he has done \nsome really great step work.  His prior relapses made her husband realize that he can\u2019t \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndrink again.  When he drinks casually it escalates.  She believes this realization \u201cgives \nhim a huge leg up on the disease.\u201d (Tr at 109-114.)   \n \nMr. M., BS, LADAC, Applicant\u2019s substance abuse counselor, evaluated Applicant \nin September 2007. He concluded that Applicant meets the criteria for alcohol \ndependence. (Gov 2 at 12.) Mr. M. provided a subsequent letter, dated April 1, 2008, \nindicating Applicant has attended his continuing care program since September 2007. \nHe attends weekly group sessions for 90 minutes. He is required to attend a minimum \nof three 12-Step meetings a week and maintain a sober support network.  His counselor \nnotes that Applicant has been appropriate in regards to his recovery program and has \nmade some recent changes in his program that appear to be beneficial.  If Applicant \ncontinues in a program of recovery, his relapse potential is low. If he discontinues his \nparticipation in a recovery program, the potential will increase. He notes that Applicant \nappears to be motivated towards his recovery. (AE A.)  \n \nDr. L., a clinical psychologist, started to see Applicant on a weekly basis on \nJanuary 2, 2008. During their initial meeting, Applicant disclosed that he was a \nrecovering alcoholic.  Applicant had an AA sponsor but was in the process of looking for \nanother sponsor when he first came to see him.  He recalls Applicant telling him that the \nlast time he had a drink was one month prior to their initial visit in January 2008. \n(Applicant testified it was November 2007. The government conceded November 2007 \nwas the more accurate date. Tr at 151.). Since he began seeing Dr. L., Applicant drank \nalcohol on one occasion in late January or early February 2008. Applicant reported this \nrelapse to Dr. L.  The last time Dr. L. saw Applicant was on April 10, 2008. (Tr at 26-45.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis is Alcohol Dependence in early full remission. Early full \nremission means a person is abstinent from alcohol for at least one month but less than \n12 months.  Applicant has abstained from alcohol for two and a half months.  Dr. L. \nstated that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is favorable as long as he is involved in treatment. \nWhen Applicant is not involved in treatment, he tends to be more isolated and has the \ngreatest tendency to relapse. Dr. L. states Applicant attends a weekly group counseling \nsession, attends AA meetings daily, and has regular contact with his sponsor. He is also \non anti-depressants which contributes to his remission.  Dr L. states Applicant has no \ndenial about his disease and is confronting his alcohol dependence.  He cannot predict \nthe future or whether Applicant will relapse in the future. Relapse is not atypical and is \ntreated as part of the treatment. Applicant\u2019s prognosis is good as long as he involves \nhimself in treatment. (Tr at 26-45.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor is a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who currently \nholds a TOP SECRET clearance.  He was involved in the hiring process. Applicant was \nrecommended for the position. He sees Applicant on a daily basis when the both of \nthem are in town.  He was not aware that Applicant had an alcohol problem until one \nday in the fall 2007 (Applicant states it was August 2007.), Applicant called in sick for a \nfew days. Applicant contacted him and told him he had a problem drinking wine and \nneeded some time off to deal with personal issues. His supervisor was aware of his \nson\u2019s situation and understood that it was a stressful period for him.  He and Applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndiscussed the situation when Applicant returned to work. Applicant told him that he was \nattending AA. He took no disciplinary action against Applicant.  He has no concerns \nregarding Applicant handling classified information. He finds him open, honest, and \ntrustworthy.  He gave Applicant a satisfactory rating on his most recent performance \nevaluation which closed out in October 2007. (Tr at 47-65.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) has worked for the company since 2005. \nShe has been in the security business for 19 years. She holds a TOP SECET \nclearance. In April 2006, she conducted initial prescreening interviews with Applicant \nwhen he submitted an application to upgrade his security clearance to TOP SECRET. \nDuring the interview, Applicant disclosed his alcohol problem and that he self-admitted \nhimself into an inpatient alcohol program in 2005. He also disclosed that his son was in \nprison for murder.  She also spoke with Applicant in the Fall 2007, after he missed a few \ndays related to his alcohol relapse.  After talking with him, she was not concerned about \nhis absence. Applicant is forthright about his alcohol issue and is seeking treatment. (Tr \nat 67-72, 74-77.)  \n  \nThe FSO indicated that Applicant serves as the COMSEC (communications \nsecurity) custodian.  She works with him on a daily basis. He has a good understanding \nof the sensitivity of the material and how it is controlled. He is very aware of what is \nrequired to protect national security information.  She believes Applicant is trustworthy. \nShe is aware of his two relapses in November 2007 and January 2008 but does not \nthink he is a security risk. He continues to perform his job. He pays attention to detail.  \nHe is aggressively seeking to manage the disease. (Tr at 72-73, 76-79.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \napply: \n \nAC DC &22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) does not apply. Applicant has no recent alcohol-related \narrests. His one arrest for driving under the influence occurred more than 35 years ago \nin 1973. There are no recent alcohol-related incidents which raise a concern.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAC DC &22(b) (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) does not \napply.  Applicant had no alcohol-related incidents in his previous or current job. He \ncalled in sick to work for a few days in August 2007 but this cannot be considered an \nalcohol-related incident at work. His co-workers at his previous job and his current job \nwere not aware of his alcohol issues until he disclosed them.  \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies.  Applicant was drinking a couple bottles of wine a night \nwhen he was drinking heavily.  \n \nAC DC &22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence) \napplies. Dr. L., Applicant\u2019s clinical psychologist, diagnosed Applicant as alcohol \ndependent, in early remission.  \n  \nAC DC &22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) \ndoes not apply. Although Mr. M., Applicant\u2019s counselor concluded that Applicant meets \nthe criteria for alcohol dependence. The record is unclear as to Mr. M.\u2019s credentials. He \nis a substance abuse counselor but it is unclear whether he is a licensed clinical social \nworker.   \n \nAC DC &22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence \nand completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) applies. Applicant completed \ninpatient alcohol treatment on March 20, 2005. He remained sober for over a year and a \nhalf but started drinking alcohol again when he retired and accepted another job in \nanother city.   \n  \nAC DC &22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence) is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable at this point. At \nthe time of the hearing, Applicant had been sober for approximately two and a half \nmonths. Not enough time has passed for AC MC \u00b6 23(a) to apply. However, it is noted \nthat Applicant sought treatment on his own. Since returning to AA in August 2007, his \ntwo relapses were brief, each occurring during the course of one evening, and Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfully disclosed his relapses to his alcohol treatment providers. There is no issue \npertaining to his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) applies.  Applicant acknowledges that he is a recovering alcoholic.  He \nhas taken steps to deal with his alcoholism since March 2005. He was sober for a year \nand a half. Although, he started to drink alcohol because he thought he could do so \nsocially, he came to the realization that he could not drink alcohol in August 2007 and \nbegan to attend AA meetings again.  He attends AA meetings daily. He attends a \nweekly group meeting with a substance abuse counselor, and is being treated by a \nclinical psychologist. He has been proactive in his alcohol treatment, recognizing the \nneed to change his sponsor.  He has been sober since January 23, 2008.    \n \nAC MC \u00b623(c) (the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or a treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress) is not applicable because Applicant returned to \ndrinking alcohol after his inpatient treatment in March 2005.  He is making satisfactory \nprogress in his current program. \n \nFC MC &23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a \nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program) applies.  Although he has relapsed in the past, Applicant \nhas demonstrated that he is proactive in his fight to remain sober.  He attends daily AA \nmeetings, has a sponsor, and acknowledges his alcoholism.  Dr. L., a licensed clinical \npsychologist, gives him a favorable prognosis as long as he remains involved in \ntreatment. Applicant is actively involved in treatment, as verified by his substance abuse \ncounselor, and his wife. His wife has noticed a positive change in Applicant since \nAugust 2007. Although Dr. L.\u2019s diagnosis states that Applicant is in early full remission \nfrom his alcohol dependence, Applicant has not tried to hide his disease including his \ntwo relapses.  He voluntarily sought treatment. He has established that he is serious \nabout remaining abstinent.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the impact that \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s crime and incarceration had on him. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s co-workers and friends. I considered his 31 years of service as \na federal government employee. I considered the comments from his clinical \npsychologist and substance abuse counselor who verify that he has actively worked the \nprogram since September 2007. Although he had two incidents of relapse in November \n2007 and January 2008, he did not hide these incidents which indicate his inclination to \ndeal with his alcohol problem.  Applicant has been sober for two and a half months.  It is \nnoted that he identified that he was having trouble with alcohol again in August 2007 \nand took steps to achieve sobriety since that date. He has mitigated the concerns raised \nunder alcohol consumption based on his honesty about his alcoholism and the steps he \nhas taken to control his sobriety.  Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, is found for \nApplicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Campbell, Esquire \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 31, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline G for alcohol consumption and Guideline J for criminal\nconduct. Both guidelines are based primarily on Applicant\u2019s three arrests for driving\nunder the influence (DUI) of alcohol. \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nMarch 11, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See E-mail to Counsel, dated March 4, 2008, in the correspondence folder of the case file. \n3\n See E-Mail to Counsel, dated March 10, 2008, in the correspondence folder of the case file. \n4\n2\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 16, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled on January 30, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on February 7, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 29, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit an additional documentary exhibit. It was timely submitted and\ndepartment counsel had no objections to it. It is admitted as Exhibit C\u2013physician\u2019s one-\npage letter.\nOn March 4, 2008, I held a post-hearing conference call with counsel.  Based on\n3\nreview of the record evidence, I indicated that the police report for the 2006 DUI arrest\nwould be helpful in reaching my decision. Lacking authority to order production of the\ndocument, I invited counsel to submit a complete copy of the police report should they\nchose to do so. Neither counsel accepted the invitation.  For the reasons discussed\n4\nbelow, this case is decided for Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges Applicant was arrested, charged, and\nconvicted of two DUI offenses in 1987 and 1990; it alleges he was arrested and charged\nwith DUI in February 2006 and that case was pending; and it alleges he uses alcohol on\na weekly basis. Under Guideline J, the SOR allegation cross-references to the three\nDUI incidents alleged under Guideline G. In his Answer, Applicant admits the factual\nallegations under both guidelines and he gave explanations for the individual incidents\nand for his situation in general. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following\nfacts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a 1995\ncollege graduate with a bachelor of science in electrical engineering. He has worked in\nthe defense industry since 1995 when he started his first job as a software analyst. In\n1999, he accepted a position as a systems/software engineer with another company.\nHe worked for that company for about 18 months. In October 2000, he accepted a\nposition with his current employer working as a senior software engineer. His day-to-day\n\n3\nwork involves software for a missile-defense program. His annual salary is about\n$70,000. The record is silent concerning Applicant\u2019s job performance as well as his\nknowledge, skills, and abilities to perform his work as a senior software engineer. He\nhas held a security clearance, at the secret and top-secret levels, since about 1996. He\nis seeking to retain a security clearance at the secret level. \nTo retain a security clearance, Applicant completed a security-clearance\napplication in January 2006. In response to the relevant question about alcohol- or drug-\nrelated offenses, Applicant disclosed the 1987 and 1990 DUI offenses (Exhibit 1). He\nhad previously reported these two offenses when he was initially granted a security\nclearance in 1996.  \nHis first DUI arrest was in 1987, when he was 17 years old. The police stopped\nhim for speeding and discovered he had been drinking (Tr. 43). He was arrested and\ncharged with DUI. Applicant believes he was treated as a juvenile offender. In a brief\nexplanation in his security-clearance application, he stated he paid a fine, lost his\ndriver\u2019s license, went to DUI class, and served probation. \nHis second DUI arrest was in 1990, when he was 20 years old. He was involved\nin an auto accident and the police discovered he had been drinking (Tr. 43). He was\narrested and charged with DUI. He received youthful offender status for this offense. In\na brief explanation in his security-clearance application, he stated he paid a fine, lost his\ndriver\u2019s license, went to DUI class, and served probation. \nHis third DUI arrest was in 2006, when he was 36 years old. He was scheduled\nto be married in July 2006, and he and a friend had met to catch up on old times (Tr.\n35). He left the establishment and was pulled over by police. He was arrested and\ncharged with DUI.\nThe case was handled in municipal court. But Applicant was never tried, and the\nDUI charge against him was nolle prossed on the city attorney\u2019s motion (Exhibit A). The\ncourt records indicate a number of continuances, that the city ran out of continuances,\nand that the arresting officer was unavailable. In October 2007, the court granted the\ncity\u2019s nolle prosequi motion and assessed court costs of $237 against Applicant.\nApplicant has a valid driver\u2019s license, without restrictions, issued by his state of\nresidence (Tr. 49\u201350).\nIn his testimony for this case, Applicant initially said he did not remember how\nmany beers he had before he was arrested in February 2006; he later estimated\ndrinking six to eight beers over a six-hour period (Tr. 61\u201363). The police required\nApplicant to take field sobriety tests, but he was not told the results (Tr. 60). Likewise,\nthe police required Applicant to take a breathalyser test, but he does not remember the\nresults (Tr. 61). He was told that he was above the legal limit (Tr. 61).\nApplicant married in July 2006 as planned, and it is his first marriage. He is the\nfather of a 14-year-old son from a previous relationship, and the son lives with his\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n4\nmother. He has paid child support over the years for his son and his payments are\ncurrent. Also, he has a 17-year-old stepson living in his household. Applicant\u2019s wife\nworks as a first-grade school teacher. \nApplicant\u2019s wife describes herself as an occasional drinker who may have a glass\nof wine with dinner or with guests (Tr. 72). Her first marriage ended after about five\nmonths due to her first husband\u2019s drinking. She is sensitive to the issue and would not\ntolerate it in a spouse (Tr. 70). She describes Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol as having one\nor two beers every now and then (Tr. 70). She keeps little alcohol (a few beers or a\nbottle of wine or both) in the house (Tr. 76). Also, she indicated that neither will drink\nalcohol when they go out to eat (Tr. 71). \nApplicant is a beer drinker. Before his February 2006 arrest, Applicant estimates\nthe frequency of his beer drinking as weekly, usually on the weekends, and he would\ndrink no more than three or four beers (Tr. 54\u201356). After his February 2006 arrest, he\nhas gone several weeks without drinking any alcohol, or he may have a beer a couple\nof days in a row (Tr. 56). In 2008, he has had \u201ca beer every now and then\u201d (Tr. 63). \nNone of his DUI arrests resulted in a court-ordered alcohol evaluation (Tr. 56).\nLikewise, a court has never ordered him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization, and he has not attended on his own (Tr. 57). He has never been\ndiagnosed or evaluated as suffering from either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\nnor has he received treatment for the same (Tr. 31).\nApplicant saw a physician in 2008 concerning his use of alcohol. In light of this\nproceeding, he was concerned if he had an alcohol problem and decided to get a\nmedical opinion (Tr. 32). Applicant underwent an examination and testing (Exhibit B).\nAccording to his physician, Applicant\u2019s \u201cblood alcohol level was within normal limits and\nhis test showed no chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol liver disease\u201d (Exhibit C).\nHis physician did not mention any diagnosis, but recommended, per his usual practice,\nthat Applicant use alcohol in moderation if at all. Applicant is more than willing to follow\nhis doctor\u2019s recommendation (Tr. 41\u201342).  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.5\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n6\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n7\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n9\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n10\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n11\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n12\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the alcohol consumption disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n16\n Revised Guidelines at 15. \n17\n DC 1 is \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child\n18\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\n DC 3 is \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\n19\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\n Revised Guidelines at 15.\n20\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the security concern is that\n16\n\u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d  \n17\nThe guideline contains several conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying. In general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of\ndrinking-and-driving. In particular, the two pertinent DC are alcohol-related incidents\naway from work and binge consumption of alcohol. Each DC is discussed below.\nFirst, DC 1  applies against Applicant due to the three arrests for DUI, which\n18\nresulted in convictions in the first two cases. The three arrests for DUI are alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work within the meaning of the guideline. Second, DC 319\napplies against Applicant because of his binge-drinking episode that resulted in his DUI\narrest in 2006. Drinking six to eight beers over a six-hour period was excessive, and\nthen getting behind the wheel of the car indicates impaired judgment. Taken together,\nthese facts and circumstances raise questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. \nThe guideline also contains four conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThe most pertinent is MC 1, which provides as follows:\n[S]o much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.20\nMC 1 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because approximately two years have passed since\nthe last alcohol-related incident. And the three alcohol-related incidents no longer cast\ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because he is no\nlonger engaging in similar behavior. Since his last arrest, Applicant has married,\nbecome a stepfather, and, most important, he has established a pattern of responsible\n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the criminal conduct disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n22\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n23\n DC 3 is \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n24\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n25\n7\nand moderate use of alcohol. The pattern is established by his own testimony, which is\nsupported by his wife\u2019s testimony and the doctor\u2019s letter indicating no chronic liver\ndisease secondary to alcohol liver disease. The record evidence shows Applicant has\nnot been diagnosed or evaluated as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, and he\nhas not been an irresponsible, problem drinker for the last two years. \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n21\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n22\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of drinking-and-\ndriving. In particular, both DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant as evidenced by\n23\n24\nhis arrests, charges, and convictions for DUI. Although the 2006 DUI case did not result\nin a conviction, there is substantial evidence, which is sufficient for this proceeding, to\nconclude that he committed the offense. In any event, the record evidence is that he\nwas arrested and charged with DUI in 2006, and that is enough to trigger application of\nDC 3. The totality of the disqualifying information calls into question Applicant\u2019s\njudgment as well as his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nTurning to the mitigating conditions of Guideline J, MC 1 provides as follows:\n[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.25\nThis mitigating condition is similar to MC 1 of Guideline G, which is discussed above.\nAnd it applies in Applicant\u2019s favor under essentially the same rationale. These\ncircumstances amount to a positive change in his behavior. \nThis case has also been considered under the whole-person concept, as the\nrecord evidence raises both disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The most troubling\naspect of this case is Applicant\u2019s 2006 DUI arrest, as the security significance of the\n1987 and 1990 incidents is reduced, in part, due to his youth and immaturity at the time.\nThat is not the case for the 2006 DUI arrest. He used grossly poor judgment in deciding\n\n8\nto drive after drinking several beers and becoming intoxicated. But it appears this\nincident of poor judgment was a lapse in an otherwise long period of responsible\nbehavior during his employment in the defense industry. Since his last arrest, he\nmarried and gained a stepchild, and he consulted with a physician concerning his use of\nalcohol.  He has established a pattern of responsible and moderate use of alcohol for\nthe last two years. He has his wife\u2019s support in this regard, and she is an occasional and\nmoderate drinker of alcohol. In other words, codependency does not appear to be a\nconcern. Taken together, these circumstances indicate that Applicant is on the right\npath. Likewise, they also suggest that he now has better self-awareness of his alcohol\nuse making it unlikely that he will engage in further drinking-and-driving or binge\ndrinking.   \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, I\nconclude that Applicant is suitable for continued access to classified information, a\nprivilege he has held since about 1996. Applicant met his burden to present sufficient\nevidence of reform and rehabilitation to mitigate the security concerns under both\nguidelines. And Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant answered the SOR 1 May 2008, requesting a hearing. On 18\n1\nJuly 2008, Department Counsel amended the SOR, and Applicant filed a timely answer.\nDOHA assigned the case to me 28 July 2008, and I convened a hearing 26 August\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 8 September 2008.\n \nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.i., and\n1.j., which he claims to have either paid or not owed in the first place. He is a 43-year-\nold senior facilities infrastructure analyst employed by a defense contractor since March\n2007. He has not previously held a clearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits confirm, 11 delinquent debts totaling\njust over $35,000. Applicant admits six debts totaling over $15,000. He disputes, with\nvarying degrees of cause, five debts. \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to his disintegrating marriage, travel\nexpenses from flying coast-to-coast during his father\u2019s final illness, and loss of a job.\nHowever, the record demonstrates that his financial problems pre-date any of these\nevents. His clearance application reflects that Applicant has been continuously\nemployed, if occasionally underemployed, from May 1997 to the present, except for a\nbrief period of unemployment April\u2013July 2002. He claims to have mapped out his own\nre-payment plans for each creditor, beginning with his ex-wife, who he asserts will be\npaid off in the next seven months. He makes one-time payments on his other debts as\nfinances allow, but otherwise intends to address his creditors seriatim, as he assesses\nthe priority to be given to each. Nevertheless, he provided no proof of that plan or a\nbudget that would permit him to achieve that plan.\nApplicant\u2019s initial financial difficulties arose in the late 1990s, when the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) filed liens against Applicant for unpaid taxes, penalties, and\ninterest for several tax years in the early-to-mid 1990s. This tax liability was incurred\nbecause Applicant withheld insufficient tax to cover his liability. Applicant claims, without\ncorroboration, to have entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS, and to have\nmade regular payments on that plan until late 2000-early 2001, when he and his wife\nbegan experiencing financial difficulties. Applicant has not explained what those\nfinancial difficulties were. He claims that he had reduced his IRS debt to $2,500 by the\ntime he stopped making payments.\nApplicant married in May 2001, having begun living with his wife and sharing\nliving expenses in May 2000. They separated in spring 2005, and were divorced in\nDecember 2006. Although Applicant claims to have been obligated to pay his ex-wife\nabout $39,000 (which Applicant claims to have reduced to about $8,000), his divorce\ndecree (A.E. A) only obligates him to pay $6,900 to her directly. The decree does\nobligate him to share certain community debts with her, including an even split of nearly\n$36,000 to the IRS for tax years 2003 and 2004. Decree provisions providing no\nspousal support for either note that both were employed, self-sufficient workers during\ntheir marriage.\nBetween February and April 2005, Applicant traveled across country to be with\nhis seriously ill father. With the increasing expense of travel, and the worsening\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nconditions of his father, Applicant relocated to be with him. His father died in June 2005.\nFrom April 2005 to November 2006, Applicant worked part-time at a second job.\nExcept for his claimed payments to his ex-wife, Applicant is not currently paying\non any of the debts that he acknowledges owing. In November 2007, he documented\none-time \u201cdown payments\u201d to two creditors, and repayment agreements with the\ncollection agent for another two creditors that obligated Applicant to pay $100 per month\nper each account (A.E. B). He made the required payments for a couple of months and\nthen stopped. In addition, Applicant has two unresolved traffic offenses (SOR, \u00b6 2), that\ncould be resolved easily except that Applicant lacks the money to pay the associated\nfines. Although he claims to live frugally, his clearance application indicates he took\nthree Caribbean vacations in October 2004, November 2005, and September 2006.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\n\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; (f) financial problems that are linked to . . . gambling problems;\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. The short summary is that government\nrecords, and Applicant\u2019s own documents, establish his accumulated indebtedness over\nseveral years. He failed to corroborate either his claimed reasons for the indebtedness\nor his efforts to address his debts.  Applicant\u2019s brief unemployment probably contributed\n3\nto his financial difficulties, as did no doubt his father\u2019s illness and his separation and\ndivorce. But Applicant was having financial problems before any of these events\noccurred. He had a tax lien from the IRS before he married, and the fact that he was\nable to make payments on an agreed plan with the IRS, does not obscure the fact that\nhe both under withheld his federal tax for several years, and apparently lacked the\nresources to pay the delinquent taxes without entering into a repayment plan. Further,\nhe stopped paying on this debt when he and his wife began experiencing undescribed\nfinancial problems, before they were married. Even if I accepted Applicant\u2019s\ncharacterization that the debts were due to circumstances beyond his control, Applicant\nhad the burden to demonstrate that he had taken responsible action to address the\ndebts. He has not done so. The most important of his assertions remain\nuncorroborated. He did not document either the debt to his ex-wife or the payments to\nher that prevent him from addressing the debts he does acknowledge.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not entirely, or even\n4\nsubstantially, due to circumstances beyond his control, and he has not acted\nresponsibly in addressing his debts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit\n5\ncounseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  The few haphazard\n6\npayments he has made do not constitute a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.7\nFurther, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling, there is nothing in\nthe record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems behind him. I\nconclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. The traffic violations are minor enough,\n\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n8\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ;\n5\nbut his failure to deal with them in a timely manner shows poor judgment.  But the real\n8\nsecurity significance of these violations is to highlight Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties,\nbecause he lacks the financial means to address these offenses.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 29, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On May 18, 2011, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Edward\nW. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\n\n1Item 6 is an arrest report pertaining to this incident.  It states that Applicant failed a field sobriety test.  It also\nstates that, upon being stopped by the police, Applicant had a difficult time finding his vehicle registration.  Applicant\n\u201cthen fumbled with his wallet and found his driver\u2019s license.  I asked [Applicant] if he had anything to drink tonight and\nhe advised he had three beers.\u201d  Compare with the Judge\u2019s finding, a quote from Item 17, regarding Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent explanation of his conduct: \u201cThe [consumption] of alcohol was in the amount of one swallow from a bottle\nof beer which was then subsequently spilled on me by the waitress . . . who bumped my table while serving other patrons.\nShortly thereafter I left the establishment to return home because the designated driver called and said that she was not\nable to come.  While on the way home I dropped some pretzels on the floor under my feet.  While trying to sweep the\ndebris from under my feet, I swerved and my driver\u2019s side tires crossed the lane marker.\u201d  In the Analysis portion of the\nDecision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s denial of guilt of the 2003 charge \u201cis not credible, and it is not supported\nby the police report and the arresting officer\u2019s account of the incident.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \n2Item 18 is the decision of the Administrative Judge in the 2006 case.  In that case, the Judge stated, \u201cI note that\nthe misconduct alleged in the SOR and demonstrated by Government\u2019s evidence occurred when Applicant was in his\nlate 30s and early 40s.  I am compelled by the record to conclude that Applicant has simply not yet demonstrated\nadequate rehabilitation of his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  It is too soon to conclude that his alcohol-related\nproblems are safely behind him.\u201d   The Judge in the case before us stated that he was considering evidence of the prior\nadjudication \u201cfor the sole purpose of establishing that Applicant was aware that alcohol-related incidents could adversely\nimpact his security clearance.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nDefense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since 1990.  He served in the Navy,\nboth on active duty and in the Reserves, from 1982 to 1990.  \nIn February 2002, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).\nHe pled nolo contendre and was sentenced to community service, six months probation, attendance\nat a DUI school, and payment of court costs.  His drivers license was also suspended. \nIn May 2003, Applicant was again charged with DUI.  He had swerved his car several times,\nand the arresting officer noted that Applicant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and that he emitted a strong\nodor of alcohol.1  Applicant refused a breath test.  The case was eventually nolle prossed.  \nIn 2006, a DOHA Judge denied Applicant a security clearance, based upon the guidelines\nfor alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.2\nIn 2009 he was again charged with DUI.  Convicted of the lesser offense of reckless driving,\nthe court sentenced him to community service, probation, and a fine plus court costs.  His probation\nrequired him to remain sober, and Applicant passed the monthly screening tests imposed by the\ncourt.  He completed a required substance abuse course and a driver improvement course.  He also\ncompleted an alcohol counseling program provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. \n \nApplicant has three delinquent debts, for $214, $1,412, and $12,978 respectively.  The\nlargest debt is based upon a judgment awarded to a credit card company.  Applicant attributed his\nfinancial problems to his wife\u2019s spending habits and stated that they would be resolved in the course\n\n3The Judge quoted from Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR: \u201cThe amounts on these accounts come from credit\ncard balances that my wife incurred and then transferred into these accounts to which I am legally responsible for to date.\nAs I have spoken to a divorce attorney and under his advice I have not paid those balances because I think in some time\nto come I can prove that those debts were not incurred by me and will become the sole responsibility of . . . my former\nwife.  What proof I have of this right now?  None, but hopefully when you read this you will be able to understand my\ndifficult position.  Eventually this will be cleared up, I promise.\u201d  Decision at 4.\n4Item 7 is a sworn statement by Applicant concerning the 2003 DUI charge.  Applicant stated that the arresting\nofficer had failed properly to conduct the field sobriety test \u201cby not asking if I was on pain medication or if I had any\ninjuries.  I was not able to do the field sobriety test because of an injured back.  Case was dismissed.  I was on prescribed\nmedication for back pain.\u201d    \nof anticipated divorce proceedings.3  \nIn his analysis of Applicant\u2019s security concerns, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated conduct was recent and that he was not able to determine that it was unlikely to recur.\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct with alcohol, the Judge stated, casts doubt upon his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Regarding Applicant\u2019s debts, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s contribution to the problem, but he concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated\nresponsible action in regard to his debts.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to\ndemonstrate any of the pertinent mitigating conditions.  \n  In his brief, Applicant draws attention to evidence to the effect that his physical condition\nhad contributed to his failure of the 2003 field sobriety test.4  He also discusses his wife\u2019s\ncontribution to his financial problems.  To the extent that he is arguing that the Judge failed to\nconsider these matters, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 09-06436 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2011).   In the case before us, the Judge discussed\nthe evidence which Applicant cites, but he plausibly explained his conclusion that Applicant had\nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge failed to\nconsider all of the evidence, nor has he demonstrated that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence.  \nApplicant has submitted, as part of his appeal, evidence not contained in the record, for\nexample a copy of a newspaper article addressing alleged problems with DUI arrests in Applicant\u2019s\ntown of residence.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  See also\nISCR Case No. 09-06306 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 2011).  \n The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated alcohol consumption, financial considerations, and \ncriminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 29, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines G (alcohol consumption), F (financial considerations), and J (criminal \nconduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 15, 2010, and November 29, \n2010, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 10, 2011. A \nMay 18, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on March 22, 2011. He \nanswered the FORM on April 5, 2011.1 He did not object to the admission of the items \nattached to the FORM, and they are admitted. Department Counsel did not object to the \ndocuments in Applicant\u2019s response, and they are admitted as exhibits (AE) A and B. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 26, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1990. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy and the \nNavy Reserve from 1982 until he was honorably discharged in 1990. His Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86), submitted in May 2007, listed that he attended \ncollege for a period but it does not reflect that he earned a degree. He is married with \ntwo children, ages 23 and 16.2  \n \n \nIn February 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). In July 2002, he pleaded nolo contendre and was found \nguilty. He was sentenced to community service, probation for six months, ordered to \nattend DUI school, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, and he had to pay  \ncourt costs.3 \n \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant was stopped at 1:49 in the morning after a police officer \nsaw Applicant\u2019s car swerve several times and cross the center line. The officer noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and there was a strong odor of alcohol \ncoming from the inside of the car. Applicant told the officer that he had three beers, but \nhe drank some coffee, and he felt that he would be fine to drive home. The officer noted \nthat Applicant \u201cdisplayed signs of impairment\u201d during the field sobriety test. Applicant \nrefused to take a breath test. Applicant was arrested again and charged with DUI. The \ncase was nolle prossed.4 Applicant explained his version of the arrest in a June 2005 \nresponse to a DOHA SOR: \n \nThe refusal of the breathalyzer was done under the advice of my attorney, \n[name, address, and telephone number], with extenuating circumstances. \nThe comsummation [sic] of alcohol was in the amount of one swallow from \na bottle of beer which was then subsequently spilled on me by the \nwaitress, [first name], who bumped my table while serving other patrons. \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s answer contained ambiguous language that could be interpreted as a request for a hearing. I \nasked Department Counsel to contact Applicant and ascertain whether he wanted a hearing. Applicant \ninformed Department Counsel that he still wanted a decision on the written record.  \n \n2 Items 4, 19; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.  \n \n3 Items 2, 5, 8; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.  \n \n4 Items 2, 6-8.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nShortly thereafter I left the establishment to return home because the \ndesignated driver called and said that she was not able to come. While on \nthe way home I dropped some pretzels on the floor under my feet. While \ntrying to sweep the debris from under my feet, I swerved and my driver\u2019s \nside tires crossed the lane marker which is why I was pulled over by a \nrookie policeman. He did smell beer in my car mostly because I was \nwearing a full can. I immediately called my attorney who instructed me not \nto succumb to a breathalyzer and to refuse all sobriety tests. I was \nnervous and followed the advice of my counsel. The details were \nexplained to my counsel and I was told not to worry that the charges \nwould be thrown out of court. I followed the advice of my attorney. I also \nsuffered a back injury which made it very difficult to walk around. The back \ninjury was caused while washing my neighbors\u2019 dog earlier that day. The \ncharges were nolle [prossed] and I paid no more attention to the matter.\u201d5 \n \n \nA DOHA administrative judge revoked Applicant\u2019s security clearance on March \n31, 2006, under the guidelines for alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and criminal \nconduct.6   \n \n \nApplicant was arrested In February 2009 and charged with DUI. In July 2009, he \nwas found guilty of the lesser charge of reckless driving. He was sentenced to \ncommunity service, probation, and he had to pay a fine and court costs.7 \n \n \nApplicant was required to remain sober as part of his probation. He stated that he \npassed the monthly screening tests imposed by the court. He completed a state-\nrequired 21-hour alcohol substance abuse education course and a driver improvement \ncourse. He also received alcohol counseling from the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA).8  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts of $214 and $1,412, and a judgment of \n$12,978 that was awarded against Applicant for a credit card company in December \n2009. Applicant admitted that he owed the delinquent debts and the judgment. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he stated he was unaware of the $214 debt to a telephone \ncompany alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, but he would \u201cresolve that immediately.\u201d9 He wrote \nabout the $1,412 delinquent debt and the $12,978 judgment in his response to the \nSOR: \n \n                                                          \n5 Item 17.  \n \n6 Items 16-18. I am considering this information for the sole purpose of establishing that Applicant was \naware that alcohol-related incidents could adversely impact his security clearance. \n \n7 Items 2, 10.  \n \n8 Items 2, 9; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE B.  \n \n9 Item 2; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.  \n\n \n4 \n \nI am legally responsible for [debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c] and I am \nnot disputing the amounts. What I will make you aware of is the fact that \nmy \u201cwife\u201d, my trusted life partner, has a problem with hoarding. The \namounts on these accounts come from credit card balances that my wife \nincurred and then transferred into these accounts to which I am legally \nresponsible for to date. As I have spoken to a divorce attorney and under \nhis advice I have not paid those balances because I think in some time to \ncome I can prove that those debts were not incurred by me and will \nbecome the sole responsibility of the soon to be my former wife. What \nproof of this I have right now? None, but hopefully when you read this you \nwill be able to understand my difficult position. Eventually this will be \ncleared up, I promise. \n \n \nWhen he responded to the FORM, Applicant stated that he had denied his wife\u2019s \naccess to his bank accounts, so she will no longer be able to incur debts without his \nauthorization. He enrolled in credit counseling, and he submitted a debt management \ncompany\u2019s activation form for him to enroll in the company\u2019s \u201ccredit card balance \nmediation program.\u201d He did not provide proof of any payments toward his judgment and \ndelinquent debts.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n                                                          \n10 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; AE A.  \n\n \n5 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 2002, 2003, and 2009. His \nalcohol-related incidents raise AG \u00b6 22(a) as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related incident occurred in February 2009. He \nwas required to remain sober as part of his probation. He completed a state-required \n21-hour alcohol substance abuse education course and a driver improvement course. \nHe also received alcohol counseling from the VA. He did not address in his response to \nthe FORM whether he is currently drinking. I find that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nincidents are recent, did not happen under unusual circumstances, and I am unable to \ndetermine that they are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents continue \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence to establish any of the mitigating conditions.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s three alcohol-related driving offenses are sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted in 2002 and 2009. His statement that he was innocent of \nthe 2003 charge is not credible, and it is not supported by the police report and the \narresting officer\u2019s account of the incident. I find there are no applicable mitigating \nconditions under the same rationale discussed under the alcohol consumption \nguideline.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant blamed his wife for his financial problems. Her actions could qualify as \nconditions that were outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant promised to pay the $214 debt to a \ntelephone company, which he admitted was his responsibility. He provided no evidence \nthat he did so. He stated that he hoped to eventually be absolved of liability for the other \ndebts, but the largest debt has already been adjudicated by a court, and a judgment \nwas awarded against him. I find that Applicant did not act responsibly and make a good-\nfaith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts. He received some \nfinancial counseling, but his finances are not under control. His financial issues are \nrecent and ongoing. I am unable to determine that they are unlikely to recur. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. There are no applicable mitigating conditions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n9 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, F, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the U.S. Navy and his long \nemployment with a defense contractor. However, he has three alcohol-related arrests, \nthe last occurring after his clearance was revoked in part for his previous two arrests. \nHe also has unresolved delinquent debts.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated alcohol consumption, financial considerations, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 16,\n2006. On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nH for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 19, 2007. He\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on\nJanuary 15, 2008 and I received the case assignment on the same day. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 28, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 14, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nMarch 6,2008\n\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated August 16, 2006).\n1\nId.\n2\nTr. 32.\n3\nTr. 37.\n4\nTr. 48; GE 3 and 4.\n5\n2\nA through C, without objection. He also presented one witness. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 22, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received December 3, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1999.  He is married with two young children. He has been with his\n1\ncurrent employer since May 2006.2\nApplicant used marijuana sporadically from 1995 until 1999 while he was in high\nschool. He also purchased it from friends while he was in school and used it on the\nweekends with his friends. He sometimes sold marijuana in joint form to his friends. \nAfter graduation from high school, Applicant started working in a local restaurant.\nHe continued to use marijuana occasionally and bought it when he needed it. If he\nhappened to have marijuana, he would sell it to his friends.3\nApplicant worked as a project supervisor from 2000 until 2005. In winter 2004, he\ntested positive for marijuana during a drug screening at work. He told his boss that he\nwould not pass the test because he had smoked some marijuana a few weeks prior.\nDuring this period of time Applicant sometimes used marijuana at parties. He remained\nwith the company. He was not disciplined nor was he ordered to attend any drug\ncounseling, but he could not work on the same area because of safety issues.4\nIn February 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana with intent to distribute. He was stopped while driving because his car had\nswerved. The police office found four ounces of marijuana. He went to court for the\ncharge. The charge was dismissed.5\nAfter the 2005 incident, Applicant realized his responsibility for his family and his\njob. He felt blessed that the charge was dismissed and realized the impact this could\n\nTr. 58.\n6\nAE A, B and C.\n7\n3\nhave on his future. Applicant does not associate with anyone who uses marijuana. He is\nmarried and has a son who is three years old.  He is active in his church. He maintains\nclose ties with his family. His older brother, who holds a top secret clearance, mentors\nApplicant. He testified at the hearing that Applicant and his family are very close. They\ninteract on a daily basis. He has seen him mature in the past few years. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother attested to Applicant\u2019s good work in school and attributes the use of marijuana\nto being involved with the \u201cwrong crowd.\u201d6\nApplicant\u2019s current employer praises his outstanding work ethic. Applicant arrives\nto work eager to complete his projects. His attendance record is excellent. He works\nwhen required on weekends and holidays. Applicant has been promoted to a site\nsupervisor within a relatively short period of time. Applicant is responsible for\napproximately 20 employees.  He is subject to random drug tests and recently passed a\ndrug screening.7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n4\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG \u00b6 25(b),\nAtesting positive for illegal drug use@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\nacknowledged using marijuana sporadically for a period of time from 1995 until 2005.\nHe tested positive for drug use in 2004. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is\nalso potentially disqualifying. Applicant admits selling and purchasing marijuana from\nfriends. In 2005, he was arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\nHe had approximately four ounces of marijuana in his possession. The charge was\ndismissed.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26 (a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nillegal use arose when he was in high school until 2005. He has abstained from using\nmarijuana for about three years. He changed his attitude about using marijuana when\nhe was arrested. He also became aware of his responsibility for his family and his\nchildren. He not only states that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, he\nhas demonstrated an ability to stay away from marijuana use and the friends who use\ndrugs. His witness credibly testified to observed changes in behavior and attitude\nsubsequent to 2005. His brother attributes this change, in part, to abstinence from use\nof marijuana. I find under the specific circumstances of this case that the behavior\nhappened so long ago and under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, that it does\nnot raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The\nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 26 (b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation. As noted above, some of the problems arose\nfrom Applicant\u2019s immaturity. Applicant has matured, is raising his family, is working in a\ngood position, is active in his church and community, and has a good attitude. For all\nthe reasons stated above, I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a high school student. He was in with the wrong crowd. He had a wake\nup call when he was arrested in 2005. He has no other criminal record. He is a hard\n\n6\nworker, a trustworthy young man. He is married and has two children. As a result, he\nhas focused his attention on providing a stable environment for his family. He was very\ncandid and forthright at the hearing.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 63 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 1964. Applicant admitted he owes the debts alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1. g. The debt in \u00b61.a is for an account that was placed for collections. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he was making payments on the debt and it would be paid soon. He provided a document, dated February 18, 2008, that shows he made one payment of $200, thereby reducing the delinquent debt from $729 to $529. No other documents were provided regarding this debt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a collection account for cable service that Applicant stated he is working on and claimed his credit report was not updated. The amount listed in the SOR is $357. He provided a receipt for payment of $200, dated February 22, 2008, and another receipt dated February 29, 2008, for $157. It is unclear if this debt is paid in full because Applicant also provided a document from Equidata showing four delinquent debts, including the same creditor listed in \u00b61.b with a balance owed as $447.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nOn January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 25, 2008, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on April 11, 2008. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nmailed to Applicant on April 18, 2008, and it was received on April 28, 2008. Applicant \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant responded by sending the entire FORM package \nback with no additional information. The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations, and denied the allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 63 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 1964. \nApplicant admitted he owes the debts alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \nand 1. g. The debt in \u00b61.a is for an account that was placed for collections. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant stated he was making payments on the debt and it would \nbe paid soon. He provided a document, dated February 18, 2008, that shows he made \none payment of $200, thereby reducing the delinquent debt from $729 to $529. No other \ndocuments were provided regarding this debt. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a collection account for cable service that Applicant \nstated he is working on and claimed his credit report was not updated. The amount \nlisted in the SOR is $357. He provided a receipt for payment of $200, dated February \n22, 2008, and another receipt dated February 29, 2008, for $157. It is unclear if this \ndebt is paid in full because Applicant also provided a document from Equidata showing \nfour delinquent debts, including the same creditor listed in \u00b61.b with a balance owed as \n$447. Handwritten notations next to the debt state \u201cmake payment\u201d and \u201cpaid full.\u201d No \nother receipt of payment for the remaining balance was provided.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.c is a collection account for sanitation services. Applicant \nstated he paid the debt and provided a receipt of payment. He provided an Equidata \ndocument that shows he owes $34.55. On this document is a handwritten notation that \nsays \u201cpaid full.\u201d No receipt of payment was provided.  \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are medical bills in the amount of $14 and $11. \nApplicant provided a medical bill receipt, dated February 22, 2008, for $100. The \npayment receipt shows a remaining balance on a medical debt of $31.77. It is unclear if \nthe payment Applicant made was for the same debt as alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a bank debt in the amount of $720 that was charged off. \nApplicant stated he made a payment on the account and is still \u201ctrying\u201d to pay it. He \nprovided no proof of payment. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR.\u00b6 1.g Applicant stated was discharged in Bankruptcy on \nSeptember 27, 2004. This debt is not listed in his bankruptcy documents. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \noff.   \n                                                          \n2008 credit report shows this account was opened in November 2004, two months after \nhis debts were discharged in bankruptcy.1 \n \n \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement and provided copies of four \nmonths of his pay stubs. Along with his regular pay, Applicant worked overtime hours. \nHis personal financial statement shows that he has a negative cash flow at the end of \neach month. Despite his overtime pay, he is not meeting his expenses and does not \nhave a budget to pay his delinquent debts.2  \n \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) on April 7, 2006. \nOn it, when asked if he had any debts more than 180 days delinquent or 90 days past \ndue, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d He also answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if he had filed a \npetition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code. Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d when \nasked if he had any judgments against him. He failed to divulge he had three judgments \nagainst him from Capitol One Bank, Household Finance, and CitiFinancial. \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he did not deliberately fail to disclose \nthe bankruptcy in 2004. He stated he \u201cdid not think about it at the time and it happened \nawhile [ago] and I forgot.\u201d3 He stated the reason he did not list the judgments was \nbecause they were included in his bankruptcy and were discharged.4 His explanation \nfor failing to list his delinquent debts was because he is paying the debts or ha[s] paid \nthem \n5\n \n \nAppellant claimed he forgot about his 2004 bankruptcy when he completed his \n2006 SCA. He also claimed that he failed to list his judgments because they were \ndischarged in bankruptcy His explanation is inconsistent and not credible. It is clear he \nwas having financial problems and difficulty paying his bills. It is unreasonable to believe \nthat Applicant was unaware he had any debts that were delinquent. Based on his \nobvious false answers to the bankruptcy and judgment questions, I find the remainder of \nhis explanations lack credibility. I also find Applicant intentionally and deliberately \nprovided false answer on his SCA. \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant alludes to conditions that were beyond his \ncontrol, such as a hurricane that presumably occurred in 2003 and unexpected medical \nconditions. He did not provide any amplifying information that related to his failure to \npay his debts. \n \n \n \n1 Item 2, 6 and 10.  \n \n2 Item 9. \n \n3 Item 2. \n  \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant had his \ndelinquents debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2004. Since then he has accumulated \nmore debts that have become delinquent. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \n \nApplicant made statements and provided some documents that he made \npayments on some of his debts, but he failed to provide proof that the debts are \nsufficiently satisfied. He alluded to conditions that he claimed were beyond his control, \nbut failed to articulate what specifically happened, how it affected his ability to pay his \ndebts, and how he acted responsibly under the circumstances. The hurricane he \nreferred to occurred in 2003, approximately five years ago. Applicant did not provide \nevidence that he received financial counseling or that there is a clear indication that the \nproblem is being resolved. He showed he made a couple of payments on some debts, \nbut it does not rise to the level of a good faith effort to repay the creditors or otherwise \nresolve his debts. Applicant had his delinquent debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2004, \nthereby allowing him to have a clean financial slate. He has since accumulated new \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndelinquent debts. Therefore, considering all of the facts, I find mitigating conditions (a), \n(b), (c) and (d) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16 and \nespecially considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Applicant intentionally and deliberately falsified information \non his SCA by failing to divulge his bankruptcy, judgments and delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2004. He completed his SCA in \n2006, a mere two years later. It is incomprehensible that he would forget such an event. \nIn addition, he stated he failed to list judgments entered against him because he \nbelieved they were included in his bankruptcy, the same bankruptcy he claimed he \nforgot to list. These judgments were not included in his bankruptcy, but were incurred \nafter it. It is simply unbelievable that he did not know he had any delinquent debts. I find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations are disingenuous and I find his omissions were intentional and \ndeliberate. Hence, I find the above disqualifying condition applies. \nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n16. Under the factual evidence and circumstances of this case, I find none of the \nmitigating conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of financial \nirresponsibility. Despite having his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2004, he again \nfailed to pay or manage his debts. He deliberately and intentionally lied about his \nfinancial situation on his SCA. Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Overall the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant requested the case be decided upon the written record.  On\nNovember 24, 2008, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by not applying\nGuideline F mitigating factors in her favor.   For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\n1\nunfavorable decision. \nApplicant offers new evidence in the form of factual assertions that are not found in the\nrecord below.   The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \n2\nApplicant argues that despite her earlier financial irresponsibility, she has been making an\nhonest attempt to correct the situation and repay her debts.  She states that she has both the\nwillingness and the ability to satisfy her debts and because of this, the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision\nshould be reversed.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge has committed error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He concluded that Guideline F Mitigating Condition 20.d.  applied to the\n3\ncase, but reasonably explained why the applicability of that factor was of insufficient strength to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge concluded that, given all of\nthe circumstances indicated by the record, that Applicant\u2019s efforts at repayment had not made much\nof a dent in her overall past-due indebtedness and that she was likely to experience additional\n\nfinancial difficulties as she continues to address her past-due indebtedness.  This conclusion is\nreasonably supported by the record evidence.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 29, 2008. Applicant filed a response\nto the FORM on June 26, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2008. Based\n1\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant admits that as of August or September 2007, she was indebted to the\nfollowing creditors in the following approximate amounts: Alliance One $705.00;\nCCA/VERIZON WIRELESS $1,253.00; Gulf Power $1,027.00; Ugly Duckling/Midland\n$8,393.00; MRS Associates $783.00; Tyndall Federal Credit Union $3,827.00; Credit\nManagement/Time Warner Cable $228.00; High Desert Creditors $99.00; Paragon\nWay, Inc. $320.00; Regency Credit/Tahiti Village $780.00; Verizon CA $90.00; AES\n$61.00; AES $444.00; and AES $382.00. Some of these debts are the result of a\njudgment. All of them are past-due. At least half of them have either been placed for\ncollection or charged off.\nApplicant admits that as of December 2005, she was indebted to the following\ncreditors in the following approximate amounts: Medical Payment Data $113.00;\nMedical Payment Data $245.00; Desert Com $495.00. All three debts were placed for\ncollection.\nIt appears from the evidence that the debts alleged in SOR Paragraphs 1i, 1j and\n1x are duplicates of other alleged debts. The evidence is insufficient to prove applicant\nis indebted as alleged in SOR Paragraphs 1g, 1h, 1k, 1o, 1u, 1v, 1z, 1aa, and 1cc.\nIn September 2007, applicant signed up with a credit agency (CESI) that helped\nher set up a debt management plan. The paperwork regarding the plan that is in\nevidence is somewhat confusing as it is unclear if applicant\u2019s monthly payments to the\nagency, which are then broken down and distributed to her various creditors, are in the\namount of $350.00 or $577.00. Further, although many of her creditors are listed in the\nplan (e.g., Alliance One, CCA/Verizon Wireless, Gulf Power, Ugly Duckling/Midland,\nMRS Associates, and Tyndall Federal Credit Union), it is unclear if they are all getting\npaid from applicant\u2019s monthly check.\nIn her response to the FORM, applicant stated, \u201cI do not disagree with the\nargument that I have been financially irresponsible, but I do argue that I have been\nmaking an honest attempt in correcting my mistakes and irresponsibilities.\nUnfortunately, I can only afford make these corrections slowly but surely.\u201d\nIn 1997, applicant received a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions\nfrom the U.S. Air Force after serving about three years. Prior to her discharge, she had\nbeen reprimanded for her work performance. The Government failed to prove applicant\nreceived 11 letters of reprimand for failing to go to her appointed place of duty or for\ndereliction of duty as alleged in the SOR.\nIn 1998, applicant was fired from a job for failing to appear for work.\nIn December 2003, she was fired from her job for poor work performance. In her\nresponse to the FORM, applicant implies her termination was the result of a personality\nconflict she had with her manager.\n\n3\nApplicant has been with her current employer since March 2004. Letters from two\nof her military supervisors were attached to her response to the FORM. The authors of\nthese letters strongly recommend that applicant be allowed to retain her security\nclearance.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\n\n4\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has numerous\ndelinquent debts that are still outstanding. This mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nfailed to provide evidence to support a finding that her present financial delinquencies\nwere caused by factors largely beyond her control. This mitigating condition is not\napplicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20. c. There is no credible evidence that\napplicant received counseling from CESI, which is listed as a separate \u201cfor fee\u201d service\nin the agreement applicant signed with them. And, it is not clear that her financial\nproblems are actually being resolved or that they are under control. Accordingly, this\nmitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nmade efforts to address most of her past-due indebtedness both on her own and by\nutilizing the services of the CESI. She has therefore initiated \u201ca good faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors.\u201d This mitigating condition is applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\n\n5\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.d., \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s less than stellar military career, ending\nwith an administrative discharge, together with her termination from two jobs, requires\napplication of this disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 17.c., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s administrative discharge and\nfirst termination occurred about ten years ago, when applicant was young and\nimmature. Her termination from her job in 2003, although more recent, occurred almost\nfive years ago. Because she has performed well at her current job since early 2004, I\nconclude this old derogatory employment information does not cast doubt on applicant\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. Accordingly, this mitigation\ncondition is applicable. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a history of not meeting her financial obligations. Although she has made serious\n\n6\nefforts to address her indebtedness, including initiating a debt consolidation plan with\nCESI, the fact is the evidence does not establish she has made much of a dent in her\noverall past-due indebtedness. Nor does the evidence establish that she is unlikely to\nexperience additional financial difficulties as she continues to address her past-due\nindebtedness, a process that will last, at best, several more years. Under the\ncircumstances, I have no choice but to conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born and raised in Afghanistan. (GE 1 at 1.) Applicant\u2019s mother died when he was about 18 months old. He was raised solely by his grandmother until he was four years old, when the two of them moved back to live with his father. Shortly thereafter, his father married his step-mother. Over the next 18 years, Applicant\u2019s five half-sisters and four half- brothers were born. Although Applicant lived in the family home until leaving for college, he was mainly cared for by his grandmother and was never close with his step-mother or her children. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the truth of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, concerning his step-mother and half-siblings, but clarified that one of his two half-brothers living in Germany is a German citizen.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Heidi L. Evatt, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was born in Afghanistan and came to live in the U.S. in 1973. His step-\nmother and nine half-siblings are foreign citizens and residents. He volunteered to serve\nas an interpreter and cultural expert in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. His service\nthere, with an interim clearance, has been superior and performed at great personal\nrisk. Based upon thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 10,\n2007. On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJune 12, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 29, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on March 16, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 31, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 23, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to\nme on May 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 6, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on May 15, 2008. During initial scheduling discussions with Department\nCounsel, Applicant requested prompt scheduling of his hearing so he could return to his\nduties supporting his Army special forces unit in Afghanistan as soon as possible. He\nagreed to waive his right to 15-day notice, and he and his counsel confirmed that waiver\nduring the hearing. (Tr. at 7-9.) The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which\nwere admitted without objection. Department Counsel also submitted a request for\nadministrative notice, with eight exhibits attached in support of the request. The request\nwas marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) II, and the supporting documents were marked\nAdministrative Notice (AN) exhibits I through VIII. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 23, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born and\nraised in Afghanistan. (GE 1 at 1.) Applicant\u2019s mother died when he was about 18\nmonths old. He was raised solely by his grandmother until he was four years old, when\nthe two of them moved back to live with his father. Shortly thereafter, his father married\nhis step-mother. Over the next 18 years, Applicant\u2019s five half-sisters and four half-\nbrothers were born. Although Applicant lived in the family home until leaving for college,\nhe was mainly cared for by his grandmother and was never close with his step-mother\nor her children. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the truth of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a through 1.d, concerning his step-mother and half-siblings, but clarified that one of\nhis two half-brothers living in Germany is a German citizen. During the hearing he also\nreported that one of his half-sisters, a married housewife, now lives in Pakistan.\n(Answer; GE 1 at 4-5, Tr. at 130, 158.)\nAfter his sophomore year of college,Applicant\u2019s university was shut down due to\nstudent unrest and rioting. Because he spoke English well, he was hired to work in the\nU.S. Embassy. After working there for a few years, he was arrested by the Afghan\nsecret police and charged with spying for the U.S. He was released after a couple of\nweeks on condition that he promise to no longer work for the Americans and not to\nleave Kabul. He had previously been accepted at an American university to finish his\neducation, and had sent some money to a bank account in the U.S. in preparation.\nWhen he told people at the U.S. embassy about his arrest and concerns over further\ntrouble, they accelerated approval of his student visa, and he left to come to the United\nStates permanently in March 1973. The only people who knew he was leaving for good\nwere his father and grandmother. (Tr. at 99-111.)\n\n3\nApplicant finished college in 1976, and married his wife in October of that year.\nShe is a U.S. citizen by birth. (GE 1 at 2, 3.) He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\n1983. He worked as a banker until losing his job in a reorganization in about 1990. He\nthen worked for two other companies in the same area until 1996, when he moved to\nthe New York city metropolitan area in search of employment. During those twenty\nyears, he was active in several community organizations. While searching for a better\njob, a process hampered by his lack of computer skills, he worked as a limousine driver.\nHe was working, and personally witnessed, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade\nCenter on September 11, 2001. He was horrified, and promptly called the FBI to offer\nany possible assistance he could with his knowledge of Afghanistan. He also called\nseveral days later to report a suspicious passenger he was hired to take to the airport.\nEventually, he was contacted and recruited by his present employer to act as an\ninterpreter/translator/cultural advisor for U.S. military forces in Afghanistan, starting in\n2004. He was granted an interim security clearance and worked with significant\nclassified information in the performance of his duties. He always handled sensitive and\nclassified information properly and in the best interest of the United States and U.S.\nforces. (Tr. at 33-35, 56-58, 97-98, 123-127.) \nWithout including too many details in this opinion, I will summarize that his\nperformance in Afghanistan, in direct support of numerous major combat operations and\ncommunity relations efforts, has been superior. As a result, he has been personally\nrequested to remain in a very important area supporting sequential rotations of special\nforces units. (Tr. at 60-66.) His commander and operations officer from the unit he\nsupported that most recently returned to the U.S. both testified to his demonstrated\ndedication, loyalty, and trustworthiness during intensive combat operations. His\ncommander testified, \u201c[Applicant] is one of the most loyal and trustworthy Americans\nand individuals I have ever worked with before.\u201d This colonel has worked overseas with\ninterpreters and advisors throughout his 20 year career, and found Applicant to be, \u201cby\nfar the most effective and loyal of those individuals.\u201d (Tr. at 31-32.) He frequently\naccompanied members of his unit into combat operations at great personal risk, and\nwas injured during one such operation. His importance to the commander was so high\nthat he eventually limited Applicant\u2019s exposure to combat to minimize the risk of losing\nan irreplaceable asset. (Tr. at 44-45, 49-53.) His former operations officer, with whom\nhe also worked very closely for nine months, described him as \u201ca patriot ... more\nAmerican than myself. He loves the United States ... [and] would do nothing that would\n... harm this country, harm its efforts in Afghanistan, or absolutely positively put in\nharm\u2019s way one of the soldiers in our units.\u201d (Tr. at 58-59.) Both officers said his family\nmembers created no security concerns for them, and expressed full conviction that he\nwould report any effort to influence or threaten his family members by any non-U.S.\ngroup to his commander immediately rather than respond unilaterally or compromise\nsensitive information in response to such acts. (Tr. at 41-46, 58.) He has received\nnumerous awards and accolades from a succession of commanders he has served, and\nprovided a substantial number of letters of recommendation commending his service\nand character. (Tr. at 66-67, 139-154; AE E.)\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s father was apprehended by government forces in the early 1980s,\nduring the Soviet occupation, and was never heard from again. Applicant presumes he\nwas killed. He went to Pakistan twice during the early 1980s, and worked with the U.S.\nembassy there, to attempt to find what happened to his father and help him emigrate if\npossible. Applicant was unable to locate him, nor has his step-mother or any half-sibling\never seen his father again. He was able to assist one half-brother, who is now a\nGerman citizen and resident, emigrate during the second trip. (Tr. at 115-119.) He made\nan undetermined but small number of other trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan between\n1983 and 2004. He did see his family members and contact them by telephone\ninfrequently during those years. After his return to Afghanistan in 2004, he also visited\nthem on several occasions, including once when the family held a memorial service to\ncommemorate his father. These visits, since 2004, took place with the knowledge,\npermission, and encouragement of his commander, who was able to and did keep track\nof his whereabouts as a safety matter. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. at 35-39, 119-122.) Applicant\nand his family members belong to a minority ethnic group in Afghanistan that live in an\narea away from Taliban influence and support the coalition. None of them has any\nconnection to either the Afghan government or the Taliban. (Tr. at 49, 132-133.) While\nthey, like everyone in Afghanistan, is at risk of violence or terrorist attack, Applicant\u2019s\ncommander assessed that any additional risk to his family from his status as an\nAmerican fighting with government and coalition forces was marginal, and was never a\nconcern that Applicant expressed in any way. (Tr. at 48-49.) Applicant owns no property\nand has no financial assets in Afghanistan. (Tr. at 136.) He never discusses his work\nwith his family members. His testimony during the hearing was forthright and credible.\nI have taken administrative notice of the facts set forth in HE II, including the\npresent dangerous nature of Afghanistan and the ongoing fighting there between\nAfghan government and coalition forces against the Taliban. There is no evidence of\nAfghan government espionage activity directed toward their U.S. or coalition allies in\nthis fight. That government is working to establish a functional democracy.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two\nof them: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant has had some contact over the years with his step-mother and half-siblings.\nSince he began working for U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2004, he has seen those who\nare presently in Afghanistan (step-mother, two half-brothers, and four half-sisters)\nseveral times, with full command knowledge and permission on each occasion. His\ncontact with them creates a marginally heightened risk to their potential subjection to\nexploitation, pressure or coercion. Because they belong to an ethnic minority that is\nstrongly opposed to the Taliban, they would not willingly assist in any efforts to hurt U.S.\nor coalition interests. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family in Afghanistan could create a\npotential conflict of interest between his security obligations and his desire to help them\nonly in a situation wherein they were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if\nhe did not cooperate. None of them have any government connection or other position\nin which they could otherwise benefit from his provision of sensitive information or\ntechnology. Thus, under either disqualifying condition, security concerns in this case\nwould arise in connection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected\ninformation from Applicant by threatening harm to his family members in Afghanistan. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in this case are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n\n7\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority; and,\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country.\nThe positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Afghanistan involve\nno government or military connection and they would have no interest in acquiring\nprotected information. Only their physical presence creates the potential that their\ninterests could be threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice\nbetween their interests and those of the U.S. Because they and their community are\nstrongly opposed to forces hostile to U.S. interests in Afghanistan, the likelihood of such\na situation is substantially reduced. The Afghan government is a U.S. ally that does not\npose an intelligence risk through Applicant\u2019s family members, who are supporters of the\nAfghan and coalition efforts to defeat the Taliban and establish a working democracy. \nApplicant produced very significant evidence establishing mitigating condition\n8(b). He does feel some loyalty to his family members in Afghanistan, but far less than\nhe would to any full-blooded relatives. By his actions in support of U.S. operations there,\nand by the testimonials of many experienced officers with whom he has served,\nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in and toward the U.S. are so deep and\nlongstanding that he would absolutely resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. He moved permanently to the U.S. in 1973, and became a citizen in 1983. He\nhas willingly and frequently risked his own life in combat and combat support\noperations, and testified convincingly that he would resolve any threat to his family\nmembers by immediately reporting it to his military superiors. He knows he could do\nnothing by himself that would actually benefit any relative who might be held or\nthreatened by hostile forces, so the compromise of classified information would not\nbenefit their interest in any event. \nApplicant and his counsel attempted to establish mitigating condition 8(c) through\ndescription of his contacts and communications with his family members as infrequent.\nIn addition to the presumption that contact with family members is not casual, I find that\nthe number of ongoing contacts and communications with his family members over the\n35 years since he left Afghanistan do not establish casual and infrequent contacts under\ngoverning Appeal Board case law. However, all of Applicant\u2019s contacts and activities\nwith his relatives since he returned to Afghanistan and began working with sensitive\ninformation have been approved, and even encouraged, by his unit commander and\nsecurity personnel. He has properly reported all unofficial foreign contacts, and there\nhave been no requests or threats to report. This establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d)\nand (e).\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although this case concerns\nGuideline B, and security concerns do not arise from any questionable conduct by\nApplicant, several factors bear further analysis. He is a mature and serious individual\nwhose dedication to supporting U.S. national security interests is evident from his\ndemeanor and his actions. After personally witnessing the September 11 terrorist\nattacks on New York City, Applicant was motivated, by patriotism and a strong desire to\nserve U.S. national interests, to volunteer for service as an interpreter and cultural\nexpert in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He has done so, at great personal risk,\nfor some four years and is highly sought after by unit after unit based on his expertise\nand demonstrated dedication to furthering U.S. interests there. While holding an interim\nclearance, he carefully safeguarded sensitive information and complied diligently with all\nsecurity procedures. \nThe Appeal Board has recognized an exception to the general rule that\nadministrative judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior history of\ncompliance with security procedures and regulations significant probative value in\nGuideline B cases. This exception arises, \u201cwhere the applicant has established by\ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and\nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the\napplicant had made a significant contribution to national security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) citing ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n14, 2006). While not recited in detail in my findings of fact, for reasons of privacy and\nsecurity, this record is replete with exactly such credible independent evidence, which\nhas been considered in reaching my decision.   \n\n9\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from the citizenship status and residence\nof his step-mother and half-siblings in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Germany. Overall, the\nrecord evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:                                   For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 24, 2008, and requested a hearing. I\nreceived the case assignment on April 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nApril 30, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received four government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the close of\nthe hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request, to allow him to submit\ndocuments. Applicant then submitted three exhibits, within the time allotted, that I\nadmitted as Exhibits A through C. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June\nJuly 30, 2008\n\nHe was concerned primarily for the well-being of his son who remained, at that time, with his estranged wife.\n1\n2\n13, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old single man with an eight-year-old child. His four-year\nmarriage to the child\u2019s mother ended in divorce in 2004, and they share joint custody of\nthe child. He has had physical custody of the child since December 2007 (Tr. 18). \nApplicant has a high school degree and is currently attending college, majoring in\ncomputer networking systems. He is a warehouse worker for a contractor. His duties\ninclude maintaining property and keeping inventory records (Tr. 47).\nApplicant has approximately $13,000 of delinquent debt. He accrued most of it\nwhen he was married. His then-wife managed their income, but repeatedly failed to pay\ntheir bills (Tr. 21). \nThe bills include delinquent car notes (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b), utilities\n(SOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n), medical bills (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.g, 1.m, 1.p, through 1.r), a payday loan (SOR subparagraph 1.i), a bill\nfor overdue library books (1.j), a rental delinquency (SOR subparagraph 1.o), a\ndelinquent student loan (SOR subparagraph 1.s), and a department store credit card\n(SOR subparagraph 1.t). Although he admitted the debt listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.u, he did not recognize it. \nApplicant purchased the car listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b in the late 1990s\nwhen he was 19 or 20 years old. It malfunctioned shortly afterwards, and a dispute\nensued with the dealer regarding repair payments. Applicant refused to pay for repairs,\nand the dealer repossessed it (Tr. 25). \nApplicant purchased the car listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a approximately five\nyears ago. When the account grew delinquent, he contacted the creditor and promised\nto pay. He did not follow through with his promise (Tr. 23). Recently, in April 2008, he\nagain contacted the creditor to arrange a payment plan (Exhibit A).\nAll of the utilities except SOR subparagraphs 1.f, 1.l and 1.n stem from\nApplicant\u2019s failed marriage (Tr. 24). When Applicant and his wife separated in 2001, he\nmoved from their shared apartment, but never transferred responsibility for the utilities.1\nHis testimony that he is satisfying them through payment plans was unsupported by\ndocumentary evidence. Similarly, his contention that he had arranged to pay the utility\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 1.f was unsupported by documentary evidence.\n\n3\nApplicant satisfied the utility listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l (Exhibit B), and the\noverdue library book fine listed in subparagraph 1.j (Exhibit C). His dispute of SOR\nsubparagraph 1.n is unsupported by documentary evidence. \nThe medical bills were for routine treatment for Applicant\u2019s son. He is attempting\nto organize payment plans (Tr. 32). He disputes the medical bill listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.m. (Tr. 33). Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquencies are outstanding.\nIn 2000, Applicant was unemployed for six months after being laid off (Tr. 45).\nBetween 2002 and 2004, he worked sporadically, struggling to make ends meet through\njobs with insufficient income.\nCurrently, Applicant has $7,000 invested in a 401(k) plan, and $125 in a savings\naccount. He recently received a $100 per month raise. He owns one car, and has fully\nsatisfied its note.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s longstanding financial problems trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were partially caused by bad decisions\nindicative of youthful immaturity. His failed marriage, a six-month period of\nunemployment, and a two-year period of underemployment also contributed to his\ndelinquencies. None of the mitigating conditions apply, however. Applicant testified that\nhe was negotiating payment plans for some of the delinquencies, and that the\nremainder were either satisfied or to be satisfied in the near future. The only\ndelinquencies he definitively proved he had satisfied were an overdue library book fee\n(SOR subparagraph 1.j) and a utility bill (SOR subparagraph 1.l), collectively less than\n$75.\nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved somewhat in the last four years. He deserves\ncredit for assuming physical custody of his son, and attending college while working full-\ntime. He provided scant documentary evidence to support his assertion that he was\ngradually satisfying the delinquencies, however. Also, he earlier failed to fulfill a promise\nto repay one of his automobile loans. Consequently, his assertion that the delinquencies\nare under control has limited probative value. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n5\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the whole person factors in the financial considerations section of\nthe decision, and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. Clearance is\ndenied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m - 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
