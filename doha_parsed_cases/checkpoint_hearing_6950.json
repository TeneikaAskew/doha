LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 39-year-old man who immigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan in 1998. He\nobtained U.S. citizenship in 2005. After becoming a U.S. citizen, he worked as a contract linguist\nfor about 18 months in Afghanistan where he served in harm\u2019s way with members of the U.S. armed\nforces. He is married to a U.S. citizen who is also an Afghan native. They have three young sons who\nare native-born U.S. citizens. Although he has family ties to Afghanistan, his most significant\ncontacts and ties are to the U.S. Applicant has mitigated any potential foreign influence security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7 (department counsel may request a hearing within 20 days of receipt of an\n3\napplicant\u2019s answer to an SOR). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on September 16, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative\ncomplaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline B\nfor foreign influence based on Applicant\u2019s family ties or connections to Afghanistan. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn September 29, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. Department counsel timely requested a hearing on October 12, 2007.  The hearing took\n3\nplace as scheduled on November 7, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 26, 2007.\n   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant may be subject to foreign influence due\nto his family ties or connections to Afghanistan. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e. In addition, the following facts are established.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old linguist employed by a language-related services company. He has\nworked for the company since October 2005. He is fluent in Pashto and Dari, which is the Afghan\ndialect of Farsi (Persian). He immigrated to the U.S. in 1998 via his marriage to a U.S. citizen (and\nan Afghan native). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. He is a first-time applicant for a\nsecurity clearance, although he held an interim security clearance without  problems until this action\nwas commenced. He is currently in an unpaid status with his company until this action is resolved.\nApplicant has immediate family members who are now living in Kabul, Afghanistan. His\nmother and father are both retired. Applicant sends his parents about $150 monthly to assist them\nin their retirement. His father previously worked as a driver. His five younger brothers live with their\nparents. None of his brothers work for the government of Afghanistan, and all of his family members\nare opposed to the Taliban. His sister is a lawful resident alien living in the U.S., and she is married\n\n3\nto a U.S. citizen. She is employed cleaning offices. Applicant has a close family, but his contact is\nlimited to speaking with his parents on the telephone. He sometimes speaks to a brother when he\ncalls his parents. He calls his parents once or twice a month and for certain holidays.  \nApplicant was born in Kabul in 1968. He was raised in Kabul and completed his secondary\neducation there. In approximately in 1990, Applicant, and his family of five brothers, one sister, and\nmother and father, relocated from Kabul to another area of the country that they believed was safer.\nThe family\u2019s move was motivated due to concern about the Taliban.  \nIn approximately 1991\u20131992, Applicant and his family moved to Pakistan. Applicant worked\nselling produce at a local market. In about 1995, Applicant saw, but did not meet, his future wife\nwhen she had traveled from the U.S. to Pakistan to visit family. She had previously immigrated to\nthe U.S. and obtained U.S. citizenship in 1994. After her return to the U.S., Applicant approached\nher eldest brother (her father was deceased) and requested permission to marry in keeping with\nAfghan custom and tradition. The brother agreed to talk with his sister about the proposal. After\nseveral months, the brother informed Applicant that his sister would travel to Pakistan in 1996 and\nshe would decide if she would marry Applicant. She arrived in 1996 and met Applicant in\naccordance with Afghan custom and tradition. She accepted the proposal, and in due course she and\nApplicant married in October 1996. \nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to the U.S. after the marriage ceremony and she submitted the\nnecessary paperwork for Applicant\u2019s immigration to the U.S. He arrived in the U.S. in January 1998.\nThey have three sons, ages 6, 7, and 8, all of whom are native-born U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s sons\nattend public school. \nHe has been gainfully employed since at least September 1998, sometimes working two jobs.\nIn about March 2005, Applicant left one job because his wife accepted a six-month contract as a\nlinguist in Afghanistan. During this period, Applicant was the primary care giver for their children.\nHis wife served as a linguist for a medical team that traveled throughout the country.\nAfter his wife returned, and after becoming a U.S. citizen in September 2005, Applicant\naccepted a linguist position and traveled to Afghanistan on official travel orders in about October\n2005 (Exhibit A). As his family had returned to Kabul in light of the overthrow of the Taliban,\nApplicant sought permission from his site manager to visit his family. The site manager, in turn,\nsought approval from the Army who approved his request. Applicant visited his family for one day\nin October 2005. A subsequent request from Applicant was not approved by the Army, and\nApplicant honored that decision. \nApplicant served as a linguist in Afghanistan for a total of 18 months in three six-month\nperiods as follows: October 2005\u2013April 2006, May 2006\u2013October 2006, and December 2006\u2013June\n2007. In between, he returned to the U.S. to see his wife and children. Applicant served with military\nintelligence and special forces elements of the U.S. Army (Exhibits B and D). Several soldiers have\nsubmitted character references on behalf of Applicant, and they describe Applicant as a dedicated\nand valuable team member (Exhibit B). The most significant letter was written by a special forces\nofficer and detachment commander who had this, in part, to say about Applicant:\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n4\n[Applicant] accompanied the detachment on several operations in the Kandahar\nProvince. His skills assisted the Commander in the employment of Afghan forces\nwhile in a very intense battle against the Taliban that lasted 2 days, 2 nights, and took\nthe lives of 5 friendlies and wounded one. During the battle [Applicant] displayed the\ncourage and loyalty to the United States that goes beyond his call of duty. He was the\nperson who passed information about the enemy situation and impending attack in\norder to prepare a defense that saved many lives.\n*  *  *\nHe is a strong hearted man with compassion for what he does. He takes pride in his\nwork and requires little supervision. [Applicant] is a person whom our detachment\nhad entrusted and we were not let down. [Applicant] displays extreme loyalty to the\nAmerican forces and our goals for Afghanistan (Exhibit B at 5). \nNeither Applicant nor his spouse has any financial interests in Afghanistan. Their financial\ninterests are all in the U.S. and consist of a home (with a mortgage), a bank account with several\nthousand dollars, vehicles, and personal property. \nAdministrative notice is taken of the certain facts about Afghanistan as described in the\ngovernment\u2019s written request (Exhibit 2). Seven of the eight source documents for the request are\nreports by the U.S. Department of State, and the eighth is from the Director of National Intelligence.\nIn general terms, the request describes Afghanistan\u2019s history since it became an independent nation\nin 1919, the U.S. Government\u2019s relationship with and concerns about Afghanistan, and the current\ngeopolitical situation in Afghanistan. For example, in a recent travel warning, the State Department\nwarns against travel to Afghanistan by U.S. citizens due to ongoing threats to kidnap or assassinate\nU.S. citizens and the inability of Afghan authorities to maintain order and ensure safety. In addition,\nthe Taliban continue to seek to undermine the democratically elected government and use terrorism\nagainst Afghans, U.S., and NATO personnel. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n4\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n6\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n5\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n8\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n9\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n10\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n11\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n12\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n14\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 5\u20136 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n15\n Revised Guidelines at p. 5. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at p. 5. \n17\n See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n18\n2001).\n Revised Guidelines at p. 6. \n19\n6\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  a security concern may arise due to foreign\n15\ncontacts and interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  There are\n16\ntwo disqualifying conditions  that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this\n17\ncase:\nDC 1. [C]ontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion; and \nDC 2. [C]onnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group,\nor country by providing that information. \nOf course, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not\u2014as a\nmatter of law\u2014disqualifying under Guideline B. But if only one relative lives in a foreign country\nand an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.18\nHere, the two disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant has contacts with and\nconnections to his immediate family members in Afghanistan. He comes from a large and close\nfamily, most of whom live in Afghanistan. He has regular telephonic contact with his parents and\nsometimes his brothers. He sought and obtained permission to visit his family in October 2005\nduring his first work assignment in Afghanistan. These circumstances create the potential for a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of\nhis ties to immediate family members, primarily his parents, in Afghanistan. Also, the circumstance\nof his financial support to his parents is relevant because it indicates the strength of his family ties.\nThe $150 monthly payments, however, are not enough to constitute a substantial business, financial,\nor property interest in a foreign country and the fifth disqualifying condition under the guideline does\nnot apply. \nFour of the six mitigating conditions  under the guideline may apply to the facts and\n19\ncircumstances of this case:\n\n See Exhibit 2 (setting forth the U.S. Government\u2019s concerns about Afghanistan and the geopolitical situation\n20\nin Afghanistan).  \n7\nMC 1.  [T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.;\nMC 2.  [T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest; \nMC 3.  [C]ontact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation; and \nMC 4. [T]he foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority. \nThe first and third MC do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships with his immediate family\nmembers in Afghanistan are of sufficient magnitude or strength to negate these two MCs. He has\nregular contact with his parents and traveled to see them when he was in Afghanistan in 2005. In the\npost-9/11 world, there is at least a remote or slight possibility that dangerous elements (e.g., the\nTaliban)  within Afghanistan could attempt to use his family members to coerce or pressure\n20\nApplicant.\nBut Applicant did establish that the second MC applies in his favor. The record evidence\nsupports a conclusion that Applicant has a depth of loyalty to the U.S., so that he can be expected\nto resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. He demonstrated his depth of his commitment\nto the U.S. by serving 18 months, at times coming in harm\u2019s way, assisting the U.S. armed forces\nin Afghanistan. Indeed, according to the special forces detachment commander, Applicant\u2019s\nperformance of duty on one particular occasion could be described as heroic. In addition, his spouse\nserved as a linguist with the U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan. Suffice it to say, they are few\nhouseholds in the U.S. where both spouses have volunteered to work in a combat zone. \nAlso, Applicant established that the fourth MC applies to his travel to Afghanistan and\nvisiting his family in October 2005. First, Applicant traveled to that country on official governmental\norders (Exhibit A). Other than the three trips to Afghanistan via official orders, Applicant has not\ntraveled there on his own. Second, he visited his family only after he received approval through his\nsite manager and from the Army. His second request to visit was denied, and he accepted that\ndecision. Given these circumstances, Applicant is entitled to mitigation under MC 4. \n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 5.\n21\n8\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this is not a case of \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d  with\n21\nan applicant who has one foot in the U.S. and one foot in his native country. On the contrary, the\nevidence shows Applicant has both feet planted in the U.S. and that his most significant contacts and\nties are to the U.S. For example, both he and his wife are U.S. citizens, their three sons are native-\nborn U.S. citizens, and his employment and financial interests are in the U.S. His service on behalf\nof the U.S. in a combat zone is further evidence of the strength of his ties to the U.S. This\ncircumstance and the favorable character letter from the special forces commander deserve\nsubstantial weight. Given all these circumstances, the record evidence supports a conclusion that\nApplicant can be expected to resolve any potential foreign influence or pressure by either coercive\nor non-coercive means in favor of the U.S. interest. \nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has explained, extenuated, or\nmitigated the foreign influence security concern. And Applicant has overcome the case against him\nand satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly,\nGuideline B is decided for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline B:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

Since \ngraduating from college in July 2004, she has worked for two different Government \ncontractors providing administrative support to Government agencies. She has worked \nfor her current employer since September 2006. Because of her good performance, she \nwas selected to do the training and development for all new contractor specialists (Tr. 7, \n36-37). She has been attending cosmetology school since December 2007 and plans to \ngraduate during the later part of 2009 (Tr. 105). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her e-QIP, her response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and \nfour credit bureau reports (CBRs) from 2004 (GEs 5 & 6), 2006 (GE 4), and 2007 (GE \n3). The SOR alleges 12 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n$25,000. Only two of the alleged debts are supported by the government\u2019s evidence \nbecause some debts were duplicated and three did not belong to Applicant.  \n \nThe Government conceded SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.l allege the same \ndelinquent debt (Tr. 43). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.l were consolidated under SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant initially included SOR \u00b6 1.a in a debt management agreement she established \nin 2005 to pay her delinquent debts. When she found out the debt was related to \ntelephone services provided by a company she never had an account with, she \ndisputed the account (Tr. 48). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is Applicant\u2019s debt. She co-signed a car note for her mother and her \nmother defaulted on the payments (Tr. 49). In early 2007, Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and agreed to pay $200 a month. She has been honoring her payment \nschedule. From May 2007 to February 2008, she paid approximately $1,800 (AE 11, at \n11-23). \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and 1.h belonged to Applicant\u2019s \ntwin sister and not to Applicant (Tr. 78-79). See AE 11 at 4 (debt settled and paid off by \nher sister), and AE 7.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g concerns a car Applicant purchased around 1999-2000, which was \ntotaled in an accident. Applicant retained an attorney to file suit on her behalf. She \ncredibly testified her attorney advised her not to make any payments on the car note \npending the resolution of her suit. Ultimately, the suit was settled for a small amount of \nmoney which Applicant used to fund her debt management agreement payments (Tr. \n66-71). Around August 2007, Applicant established a payment plan with the creditor of \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. She has been honoring her payment schedule. From August 2007 to \nFebruary 2008, she paid approximately $700 towards this debt (AE 11, at 23-29). \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, Applicant credibly testified SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and \n1.k were two different delinquent debts she had which were in collection by the same \nagency. In 2003, the collection agency consolidated the debts into SOR \u00b6 1.j, and \nobtained a judgment against her. Applicant included the judgment in her debt \nmanagement agreement and paid if off. The Government conceded the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j was paid (Tr. 88). \n \nApplicant acquired most of her delinquent/charged off debts when she was \nyoung and immature -- around the later part of high school and during college. She \ntestified her parents promised to pay for some of her college expenses and they failed \nto do so because of their divorce. In 2005, she realized the extent of her debt, and was \nconcerned about the adverse consequences of having bad credit. Applicant made \nlifestyle changes to correct her credit problems which included entering into a debt \ncounseling program, monitoring her expenses, and the use of credit.  \n \nIn May 2005, she sought financial counseling/assistance to pay her debts and \nentered into a debt management agreement contract with a company (AE 12-14). She \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                          \nsuccessfully completed her debt management agreement contract in April 2007. She \npaid most of her debts with the exception of the two debts remaining in the SOR which \nwere not included in the program. She received financial counseling as part of the debt \nmanagement payment process. \n \nApplicant has been living by herself since October 2007. She has a yearly salary \nof around $55,000, and is well regarded by her employer. She takes roommates to help \nher pay the rent ($1,045). Her monthly take home pay is around $3,500. She seems to \nhave the financial means necessary to pay for her day-to-day living expenses and to \ncontinue paying for her old debts. She only carries one credit card (with a low balance) \nwhich she uses for emergencies. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for her past \nfinancial indiscretions. She credibly testified she has learned her lesson, and promised \nto avoid future financial problems. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, and her response to interrogatories. She acquired numerous debts which \nbecame delinquent. Two of these debts were outstanding as of the hearing date. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nIn 2005, after realizing the extent of her debts, Applicant took good faith steps to \ncorrect her financial problems by establishing a debt payment program, receiving \nfinancial counseling, and making financially responsible lifestyle changes. In 2007, she \nsuccessfully completed her debt payment program. That same year, she established \npayment plans with other creditors not included in her initial debt payment program and \nhas continued her financially responsible behavior by honoring her payment obligations. \nAlthough she has missed some monthly payments, considering the evidence as a \nwhole, I find that she has acted in good faith in her efforts to repay creditors. I also find \nthat, although she is not debt free, Applicant has shown clear indications that her \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. Based on my evaluation of the \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) fully applies and AG \u00b6 20(d) partially \napplies because she did not act more aggressively sooner to resolve her debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n7 \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal \nissue), she is a law-abiding citizen. She acquired most of her bad debts while in high \nschool and college \u2013 likely because of her young age and lack of maturity. I believe \nApplicant has matured as demonstrated by her successful completion of the debt \nmanagement program, as well as honoring the payment agreements she established in \n2007. I also believe Applicant has learned the importance of having financial \nresponsibility and her past questionable financial behavior is not likely to recur.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.l: \n For Applicant \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines H, Drug Involvement, E, Personal Conduct, J, Criminal Conduct, and F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 2, 2008, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on March 11, 2008. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant on March 13, 2008, and it was received on April 7, 2008. Applicant \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit \nadditional material. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except \u00b6 2.b. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since \nNovember 2006. Prior to then he was unemployed from September 2006. He was \npreviously employed from May 2004 until September 2006 by two different employers. \nHe was also unemployed from March 2004 until May 2004. Applicant was on active duty \nin the Army from May 1998 to March 2004. He received a General Discharge under \nHonorable Conditions. He married in 1998 and has two children ages 9 and 6 years old.  \n \n \nWhile on active duty in the Army, Applicant was arrested on July 5, 2003, for \nDriving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Possession of a Controlled Substance, cocaine. On \nJuly 7, 2003, he received a drug test and the results were received on July 18, 2003, \nconfirming the presence of marijuana and cocaine in his system. During an interview, \nApplicant admitted using cocaine between June 1st and June 30th, 2001, and using \ncocaine and marijuana on July 5, 2003.1 \n \n \nOn July 18, 2003, Applicant was charged with wrongful use of marijuana and \ncocaine in violation of Article 112a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). On \nAugust 27, 2003, Applicant went to a hearing conducted under Article 15 of the UCMJ \nand received nonjudicial punishment. He was awarded a reduction in pay grade from E-\n4 to E-1; forfeitures of $575 pay per month for two months, which was suspended; and \n45 days extra duty.  \n \n \nOn August 29, 2003, Applicant was convicted in civilian court of DWI. He was \nsentenced to three days confinement and fined $750.  \n \n \nApplicant was administratively separated from the Army by reason of misconduct \ndue to drug abuse and received a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions.  \n \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on December 20, 2006. In response to Question 24 which inquired whether \nApplicant had illegally used any controlled substance since age 16 or in the past 7 \nyears, he answer \u201cno.\u201d In response to Question 23d which inquired if he had been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs, he answered \n \n1 Answer to SOR. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n\u201cyes\u201d and divulged his DWI conviction, but failed to list the charge for possession of \ncocaine. Applicant denied he falsified his answer. He stated:  \n \n \nI understood that I needed to put down my convictions and it was my DWI \nbecause to the best of my knowledge my [p]ossession of a controlled \nsubstance was dropped although I was originally charged with it.2 \n \n \nIn his response to Question 23e which inquired if Applicant had been subject to a \ncourt martial or other disciplinary proceeding under the UCMJ in the past 7 years, he \nlisted his DWI arrest, but again failed to list the charge for cocaine and marijuana use.  \n \n \nApplicant had two opportunities to divulge he used marijuana and cocaine in \nresponding to the e-QIP questions. He states he listed his DWI, but because the \npossession charge was dropped he did not include it. His statement is clear in that he \nunderstood he had been charged. The question is clear asking Applicant to list offenses \nhe was charged with. It is also clear that he went to an Article 15 hearing and was \ncharged under Article 112a for use of a controlled substance. He was discharged from \nthe Army for misconduct due to drug abuse. It is clear to me that he understood what \ninformation the questions were requesting as to if he had any drug incidents in his past \nand no where on his e-QIP application did he divulge this information. I find Applicant \ndeliberately and intentionally falsified his e-QIP application.  \n \n \nApplicant completed and swore to interrogatories on September 24, 2007. A \nwritten question asked: \u201cHave you used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, \nhallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) and/or any Cannabis (to include marijuana and \nhashish), except prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this \ninquiry.3 He explained in his answer that he did not read the question thoroughly. In \nresponse to the question: \u201cWhen did you decide to stop using illegal substances?\u201d he \nanswered \u201cWhen I got in trouble while serving in the Army [in] 2004.\u201d4 He also stated in \nresponse to a question as to why he stopped using illegal drugs the following: \u201cI caused \nmyself and my family a lot of legal & family problems that should of never happened do \n(sic) to my poor judgment.\u201d5 I find Applicant did not intend to falsify the inquiry about \nusing drugs. Clearly, he references when he stopped using illegal drugs and that he no \nlonger associates with those who do. These answers obviously correspond with his \nadmission of using drugs in the past.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about March 30, 1996 and charged with Unlawful \nCarrying Weapon, a Class A misdemeanor. On May 14, 1996, he pled guilty to the \n                                                          \n2 Answer to SOR. \n \n3 Item 6 pg. 2. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \noffense and was sentenced to nine months probation, fined $300, which was \nsuspended, and assessed court costs of $202. \n \n \nApplicant has eleven delinquent debts, of which eight are in collection status, two \nare charged off, and one is past due. The total amount of debts in collection status is \n$7,449. The total amount of debts that are charged off is $5,086. The amount past due \non the remaining debt is $2,000. \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owes the balances on the debts listed in the SOR. He \nprovided documents to show he has set up a consolidated payment plan that included \nsix debts. It appears from the documents that a plan was set up sometime in April 2007 \nand he began making payments in July 2007. The documents support he made three \nmonthly payments, totaling $915.6 Applicant failed to provide information as to which \nspecific delinquent debts listed in the SOR he is making payments on. Only one debt \nlisted in the documents he provided corresponds to a debt listed in the SOR. Regarding \nthe other debt, they may be the same, but without further information it is unclear. He \ndid not provide any additional information about the other debts listed in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant explained in his answer that before his \u201cincident,\u201d presumably he is \nreferring to his alcohol and drug arrest in 2003; he was living within his means. After the \n\u201cincident\u201d he stated:  \n \nTaking a big pay cut, paying my fines, [losing] my job and still trying to \nkeep a roof so that my family wouldn\u2019t be on the streets is not easy. I \ndidn\u2019t neglect my bills I just put my families priority first and any extra \nincome was sent to pay on what I could. My incident hasn\u2019t been an easy \nthing to overlook and overcome. Since my discharge I have been \nemployed although it took me a long time to get my first job.7 \n \n \nApplicant stated in his interrogatories that since his \u201cincident\u201d he no longer \nassociates with people who use drugs.8  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n6 Id. pgs. 8-11. \n \n7 Answer to SOR. \n \n8 Item 6 at pg. 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and especially considered (a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d), (b) (\u201ctesting positive for illegal drug \nuse\u201d), and (c) (\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d). Applicant \nadmitted he used cocaine between June 1st and June 30th, 2001, and used marijuana \nand cocaine, on July 5, 2003. To use the drugs he had to possess them. Therefore, I \nfind all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand especially considered (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, \nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), and (b) (\u201ca \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d). Applicant did not \nadequately articulate the circumstances when he used drugs in 2001 or 2003. He did \nstate that he has not used illegal drugs since his \u201cincident\u201d in 2003. He used drugs while \non active duty in the Army, fully aware of the potential consequences. He was \ndischarged because of his actions. Since then he has not associated with those who \nuse drugs. It appears he has moved on from this period of his life and is attempting to \nstay focused on providing for his family. It has been almost five years since his latest \ndrug incident. I find Applicant\u2019s behavior was so long ago and appears to have been \ninfrequent. However, under the circumstances, Applicant was serving on active duty in \nthe Army and his actions at that time cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and \ngood judgment. Therefore, I find (a) only partially applies. It also appears Applicant has \nmoved on and is no longer using drugs. He does not associate with those that do and is \ncommitted to his family. He did not sign a statement of intent with automatic revocation. \nI find (b) (1) (2) and (3) apply based on the above facts. No evidence was provided to \nconclude (4) in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI have considered the personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 \nand especially considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Applicant answered three questions on his e-QIP falsely. He \nfailed to divulge his drug possession charge and his drug use. He did divulge his DWI. \nHe admitted in his answer that he did not divulge his drug use. Considering all of the \nquestions together and Applicant\u2019s explanation, I find his denial that he falsified the \ninformation not believable or credible. If Applicant truly believed that he did not have to \nlist his drug offense when asked if he had been charged or convicted of an offense, \nbecause it had been dismissed in civilian court, then he should have listed it when \nasked about any offenses that were subject to a court martial on nonjudicial \npunishment. His statements provided in his answer and interrogatories repeatedly refer \nto \u201cthe incident.\u201d This \u201cincident\u201d clearly had a devastating effect on his life, forcing him \nout of the Army, being unemployed for a period of time and effecting his finances. It is \nobvious and clear he did not want authorities to be aware of his drug history. Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications were deliberate, made with the intent to deceive and mislead, and were in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. I also find that Applicant\u2019s answer to the interrogatories \nwas not a deliberate falsification, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nI have considered the all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 17 and especially considered (a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts\u201d), (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d), (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d), (e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d). I find \nthat none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant was untruthful on his e-QIP \napplication and took no action to provide truthful information until he was confronted.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern \nrelating to criminal conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@ \n \nI have considered all of the criminal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n31 and especially considered (a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) \nand (b) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d). I find both disqualifying \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconditions apply. Applicant was convicted of unlawfully carrying a weapon in 1996 and \nDWI in 2003. He was also found guilty in 2003 of cocaine and marijuana use while on \nactive duty. He was discharged from the Army for misconduct due to drug abuse. As \nstated above, I found Applicant deliberately and intentionally falsified his e-QIP \napplication by providing false answers to questions; felony offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001. Consequently, I find both (a) and (c) apply.  \n \nI have also considered all of the criminal conduct mitigating conditions for under \nAG \u00b6 32 and especially considered (a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened, or it happened under unusual circumstances that is it unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment\u201d) and (d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement\u201d).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s weapons offense occurred more than 12 years ago, and his alcohol \nand drug offense almost five years ago. Although a considerable amount of time has \nelapsed since these offense occurred, they cannot be viewed separately or in a vacuum \nfrom his most recent and serious offense of falsifying his e-QIP application, a felony. It \nappears Applicant has moved on and has become a devoted family man. However, his \nfailure to be truthful when applying for a security clearance and divulging his complete \npast and drug history is a serious concern and constitutes a continuing course of \ncriminal conduct. Consequently his falsifications negate any successful rehabilitation he \nmay have exhibited. Therefore, I find (a) and (d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has numerous \ndelinquent debts that remain unpaid. Although he has a payment plan for some debts, it \nis unclear if they are the same debts as in the SOR and his payment plan does not \ninclude all of the debts. He failed to provide adequate information to address this \nconcern. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d), and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts. He admitted he owes the debts in the \nSOR. He has a payment plan that includes at least one debt listed in the SOR, but did \nnot provide any information as to the specific status as to the other remaining debts. \nThere are numerous debts that remain delinquent. Therefore, I find (a) does not apply. \nApplicant found himself in financial difficulty after losing his job and being discharged \nfrom the Army. His loss of employment was due to his own misconduct, a condition that \nwas well within his control. Hence, I find (b) does not apply. There is no evidence \nApplicant has received financial counseling. He has made some effort to pay some \ndelinquent debts, but many remain. Consequently, I find (c) does not apply, but (d) \napplies partially because he has started a payment plan on some of his debts.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was charged and \nconvicted of DWI and went to nonjudicial punishment for his drug offense while in the \nArmy. This \u201cincident\u201d caused him to be discharged under other than honorable \nconditions. It also effected his financial situation. Applicant has made some attempts to \npay his delinquent creditors, but failed to provide enough information to show he is \nresolving all of his debts. Applicant has made significant efforts to put his life back on \ntrack. However, he failed to be honest about his drug past and lied on his e-QIP \n\n \n10 \n \n \napplication. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding his drug \ninvolvement, but failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under personal conduct, \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations. Overall the record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I find Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement, but failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from personal conduct, criminal conduct and financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:                                   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:                                   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a\u2013\u00b6 1.l) ranging from $43 to $7,326 for about $17,000 in total. He admitted all the debts, except \u00b6 1.c, in his response to the SOR. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 30-year-old field logistician for a company engaged in defense contracting. He has worked for this company since about June 2006, when he was discharged from the Army. He served about ten years as a unit supply specialist until he was discharged due to disability (back problems). He received an honorable discharge. His annual salary is about $62,000, a little less now because he is no longer working at a remote location where he earned a higher salary. He is not married and has no children. It appears his financial problems started when he was in the Army and carried over to the present. Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5). For example, a July 2006 credit report shows more than a dozen accounts listed in the trade section as having some sort of adverse information (e.g., past due, bad debt placed for collection, assigned to attorney/collection agency, etc.) (Exhibit 3). Likewise, the report has 11 accounts listed in the collections section. Two credit reports from 2007 further confirm Applicant\u2019s financial problems (Exhibits 4 and 5). The delinquent debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissio",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 28, 2007. The SOR is\nequivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.\nThe issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a\nhistory of financial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nApril 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 21, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on January 8, 2008. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nMarch 11, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on March 19, 2008.\nThe record was left open until March 28, 2008, to provide Applicant an\nopportunity to present documentary evidence (Tr. 75\u201381). No such matters were\nreceived. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a\u2013\u00b6 1.l) ranging\nfrom $43 to $7,326 for about $17,000 in total. He admitted all the debts, except \u00b6 1.c, in\nhis response to the SOR. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts\nare established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old field logistician for a company engaged in defense\ncontracting. He has worked for this company since about June 2006, when he was\ndischarged from the Army. He served about ten years as a unit supply specialist until he\nwas discharged due to disability (back problems). He received an honorable discharge. \nHis annual salary is about $62,000, a little less now because he is no longer\nworking at a remote location where he earned a higher salary. He is not married and\nhas no children. It appears his financial problems started when he was in the Army and\ncarried over to the present. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and\n5). For example, a July 2006 credit report shows more than a dozen accounts listed in\nthe trade section as having some sort of adverse information (e.g., past due, bad debt\nplaced for collection, assigned to attorney/collection agency, etc.) (Exhibit 3). Likewise,\nthe report has 11 accounts listed in the collections section. Two credit reports from 2007\nfurther confirm Applicant\u2019s financial problems (Exhibits 4 and 5). \nThe delinquent debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and\nthe admitted documentary evidence. With one exception noted below, he has not paid,\n\n See Applicant\u2019s testimony at Tr. 33\u201347.\n3\n3\nsettled, or resolved any of the debts in the SOR.

He believes he received about\n$30,000 after deductions. He was unable to provide a reasonable, detailed  explanation\naccounting for the $30,000 (Tr. 66-72).  \nHe estimates having about $2,300 in a checking account and about $5,000 in a\nsavings account (Tr. 57). In addition, he estimates having about $16,500 in a 401(k)\naccount (Tr. 72). He did not provide documentary evidence to support his estimates. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions. It appears Applicant has lived beyond his\n\n MC 4 is \u201c the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n19\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (scope of appellate review for findings of fact). \n20\n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks,\n21\ninsurance companies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n22\n6\nmeans, has been financially irresponsible, or is simply uninterested in addressing his\npast delinquent debts or a combination thereof. These circumstances do not bode well\nfor his security suitability. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none\napply. A potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  He  has taken\n19\na few positive steps to resolve his financial problems as evidenced by paying off the\n$111 collection account. But his efforts, in light of the remaining unaddressed financial\nproblems, are not enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. \nApplicant has done little to demonstrate an intent to clean up his financial house.\nConcerning his past delinquent debts, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic and\nworkable plan; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan; and (3) a\nmeasurable improvement to the situation. In simple terms, he did not present sufficient\nevidence to establish his case. \nGiven the lack of documentation, his claims, representations, and estimations\ncannot be accepted as facts that a reasonable person might accept as reliable\nevidence.  Large bureaucratic institutions\u2014like the Defense Department and the\n20\nsecurity-clearance programs it administers\u2014do not run on word-of-mouth.  They run on\n21\ndocumentation. As a former soldier for ten years, Applicant should be aware of this\nconcept. The documentation can be stored electronically or on paper, but it is up to\nApplicant to produce reliable evidence, to include documentary evidence, to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by him and proven by the record\nevidence.  Although Applicant is not legally required to produce documentary evidence\n22\nto prevail, the lack of documentation in a financial case makes it difficult to reach a\nfavorable decision under the clearly-consistent standard. Accordingly, Guideline F is\ndecided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on September 23, 2005.  \nOn September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 8, 2007 and answered \nit on November 21, 2007. On November 28, 2007, he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  The date of DOHA\u2019s receipt of the request for a hearing is not \nreflected in the record.  Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 7, \n2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 12, 2007. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on January 18, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 11, 2008. I \nMarch 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection, except for part of GX 3, which was excluded for \nthe reasons set out below. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until February 25, 2008, to enable him to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX B and C, and they \nwere admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX B and C is \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on February 19, 2008. The record closed on February 25, 2008. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings \n \nPersonal Representative \n \n \nApplicant stated at the hearing that a union representative had agreed to \nrepresent him but could not attend the hearing because of a medical appointment (Tr. \n5). I informed Applicant that I would postpone the hearing if necessary to enable his \npersonal representative to attend. Applicant responded that he preferred to continue \nwith the hearing (Tr. 6). Based on his affirmative waiver of his right to the assistance of \nhis personal representative, I conducted the hearing with the Applicant representing \nhimself. \n \nUnauthenticated Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 3, DOHA interrogatories that included a \npersonal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation, without calling an \nauthenticating witness as required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the \nauthentication requirement to Applicant, and he declined to waive it (Tr. 37).  I excluded \nthe part of GX 3 containing the personal subject interview (Tr. 38).  However, I permitted \nDepartment Counsel to cross-examine Applicant about the interview (Tr. 84-87). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.d \nthrough1.l, and 1.n.  He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.m, 1.o, and 2.a.  At the hearing he \nadmitted all the delinquent debts alleged except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k (Tr. 43). His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor.  He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2004. He was unemployed from May 2003 to August \n2004.  He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from December 1984 to April 2003. During \nhis last year in the Army Reserve, he was on full-time active duty, serving as an \nammunition sergeant (Tr. 44-45).  He received a security clearance in June 1994 and \nheld it until it was suspended after issuance of the SOR (Tr. 9).   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was married in October 2001.  He has no children from this marriage \nbut pays child support of about $100 a month for a 13-year-old son from a previous \nrelationship (Tr. 50-51). His spouse does not work outside the home. \n \n \nAround 1990, Applicant moved in with his seriously ill grandmother to care for \nher. Around 2000, his grandmother was placed in a nursing home by her children, and \nhe was forced to move out when her home was sold (Tr. 94). While living with his \ngrandmother, he lost his job because he was taking too much time off to care for her \n(Tr. 95-96). The combination of losing his place to live and losing his job caused him to \nfall behind on his debts, and two cars he owned were repossessed (Tr. 94-95). \n \n \nAfter moving out of his grandmother\u2019s house, Applicant rented a room for three or \nfour months from the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Tr. 67). Because she kept \nincreasing the rent, Applicant moved out. After they disagreed about whether Applicant \nowed any rent, she kept some of Applicant\u2019s property and eventually obtained a \njudgment against him.  Applicant considers the rent paid because she kept his property.  \nHe has had no contact with her and no recollection of any notices regarding the \njudgment (Tr. 53-55).  He did not provide any documentation of his dispute about the \nrent.   \n \nApplicant has not resolved the debts alleged in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.j, 1.k, and 1.m.  At the hearing, he presented a money order for the medical bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and stated he intended to deliver it immediately after the hearing, \nand obtain a receipt for the payment (Tr. 59-60). The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and \n1.k appear to be the same debt (Tr. 22), and it was settled after the hearing (GX 5; AX B \nat 2).  After the hearing, Applicant also presented evidence that the telephone bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m had been resolved.   \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nin the table below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nJudgment (Rent) \n$500 \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 5 \n1.b \nMedical \n$1,249 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.c \nCredit card \n$647 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.d \nMedical \n$133 \nPaid \nGX 4; AX A; Tr. 59-60 \n1.e \nCredit card \n$1,494 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.f \nCar loan \n$2,409 \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 5 \n1.g \nCredit card \n$5,252 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.h \nPersonal loan \n$4,070 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.i \nPersonal loan \n$1,768 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.j \nCredit card \n$635 \nSettled \nGX 5; AX B at 2 \n1.k \nCredit card \n$561 \nSame debt as \u00b6 1.j \nGX 5; AX B at 2; Tr. 22 \n1.l \nMedical \n$280 \nUnpaid \nGX 5 \n1.m \nTelephone \n$100 \nResolved \nAX B at 3 \n1.n \nMedical \n$68 \nUnpaid \nGX 5 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nOn his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 28a, \nasking if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven \nyears, and he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 28b, asking if he was currently more than 90 \ndays delinquent on any debts.  He disclosed a delinquent credit card account and the \ndelinquent medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he did not disclose the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k (a duplication of 1.j), 1.m, \nand 1.n.  He admitted he understood the two questions about delinquent debts and \ntestified he did not know why he failed to list his other delinquent debts (Tr. 81-82). \n \n \nAfter Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he was interviewed \nby a security investigator. This interview is the basis for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.o. \nwhich alleges, \u201c[Y]ou said that your financial situation could possibly be used against \nyou for the purpose of blackmail and coercion.\u201d I excluded the report of investigation \ncontaining the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview. However, at the hearing \nApplicant testified the investigator asked if he could be blackmailed, and he responded: \n\u201cIt could be possible but it ain\u2019t gonna happen on my part.  I can guarantee it.\u201d He \ntestified his delinquent debts would have a negative impact on his reputation among his \nsupervisors and coworkers if they knew about them (Tr. 86-87). \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2007, Applicant submitted a \npersonal financial statement reflecting net monthly income of $1,400 and monthly \nexpenses of about $770, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $630 (GX 3 at 6). \nHowever, his testimony at the hearing indicates this personal financial statement is \ninaccurate. He testified his net pay is about $2,800 per month (Tr. 78). Although he \nlisted his car expenses on the personal financial statement as about $150 per month, he \ntestified he spends about $400 per month to buy gas for his large four-wheel-drive truck \n(Tr. 79).  His financial statement does not list his car loan payment of $308 per month \n(Tr. 76-77). Based on his testimony, it appears that his net monthly remainder is around \n$1,300. His financial statement reflects no payments on the debts alleged in the SOR.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges fourteen delinquent debts totaling more than $19,000 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a-1.n). It also alleges Applicant admitted during a personal subject interview that his \nfinancial situation could possibly be used against him for blackmail and coercion (SOR \u00b6 \n1.o).  The security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant did not provide a receipt for payment of the $133 medical bill \nfor which he presented a money order at the hearing, I have taken Applicant at his word \nand resolved SOR \u00b6 1.d in his favor. \n \n \nThe same debt is alleged twice in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k.  When the same conduct \nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.k. in \nApplicant=s favor. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o, alleging Applicant\u2019s admission that his financial situation could \npossibly be used to blackmail or coerce him, does not allege any conduct encompassed \nby Guideline F. It merely sets out Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the nexus between \nfinancial problems and security concerns. Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment has no \nindependent security significance. Furthermore, the allegation was based on the report \nof investigation that I excluded for lack of authentication.  I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.o for \nApplicant. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are not yet resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established \nbecause he has numerous delinquent debts. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) also is \nnot established because Applicant is still financially overextended and has not resolved \nmany of his delinquent debts.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s loss of a rent-free home and his extended period of unemployment \nwere conditions beyond his control. However, he has not contacted most of his creditors \nor attempted to negotiate with them, even though he has been employed continuously \nsince August 2004. He has not sought professional assistance through credit \ncounseling services. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant had resolved only one debt, the telephone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, \nbefore learning his security clearance was in jeopardy.  He settled the medical bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b on the day of the hearing, and the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nand 1.k after the hearing. He has done nothing regarding the other debts, even though \nsome of them are for small amounts. For example, the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l and 1.n are for $280 and $68, respectively. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the judgment for rent at the hearing, but provided little information about the \nbasis for the dispute and no documentation. He has not disputed any of the other debts. \nI conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose all his delinquent debts \non his security clearance application.  The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \n\u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. \n02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).   \n \n \nApplicant understood the questions about delinquent debts, as evidenced by his \ndisclosure of two delinquent debts. He had no explanation for omitting the rest of his \ndelinquent debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to Applicant to \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). There is no evidence Applicant made any effort to correct his \nomissions until he was interviewed by a security investigator in November 2006 and \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconfronted with the evidence of his delinquent debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigating by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c).  \nApplicant\u2019s intentional omission of relevant and material information from his SF 86 was \na felony, violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. It involved his current application to continue his \nclearance. Although it is the only instance of its kind in his record, it raises doubt about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \nNo other enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He has been gainfully employed since August 2004.  \nHe earns a modest income and appears to have a net monthly remainder available for \ndebt payments. Some of his debts are for small amounts, e.g, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l for $280 and \n1.n for $68, but they were unpaid as of the date of the hearing. He has not sought credit \ncounseling and has no firm plan for resolving his debts. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA submits under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from high school to at least 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he deliberately falsified his December 2004 SF 86 by denying any illegal drug use since age 16 or in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.b, as amended).

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF 86) on December 7,\n2004. On November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline E and Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 27, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 5, 2007, and requested a decision based on\nthe record without a hearing. On December 21, 2007, the government submitted a File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nOn January 14, 2008, Applicant submitted his rebuttal to the FORM consisting of his\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n2\nstatement (Ex. A) and two character references (Ex. B, Ex. C). On January 22, 2008,\nDepartment Counsel indicated no objections to the documents being admitted into\nevidence. On January 28, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Based upon a review of the Government\u2019s FORM and Applicant\u2019s response,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately falsified a December\n7, 2007, security clearance application. In the FORM, Department Counsel correctly\nindicated that Applicant submitted his SF 86 on December 7, 2004. The Government\ndid not move to amend the SOR to correct the obvious typographical error in the date,\nbut there is no dispute between the parties about the date of the SF 86 at issue. SOR \u00b6\n1.a is hereby amended to change the date of the SF 86 to December 7, 2004, to\nconform to the evidence in the record.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA submits under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that Applicant used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from high school to at least 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that\nhe deliberately falsified his December 2004 SF 86 by denying any illegal drug use since\nage 16 or in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.b, as amended). DOHA also alleged under\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1001 by falsifying his response to the drug inquiry on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In his\nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \u201cexperimenting\u201d with marijuana in high school.\nHe denied intentional falsification, and attributed his negative response to question 27 to\nthe fact that he had not used drugs since 2003 (\u201cThe timeframe [sic] was an oversight\non my part.\u201d Item 4). After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old warehouse specialist for a defense contractor. He\nrequires a security clearance for his job duties on a U.S. military installation (Item 5, Ex.\nC).\nApplicant began using marijuana in his early teens, initially to cope with stress\nand depression. He smoked it in rolled joints approximately every other day. After he\nturned 18 in 2001, his use of marijuana varied. Some months he used it more\nfrequently, up to ten times, other months only about twice. Applicant purchased the\nmarijuana himself and/or went in with a friend to buy it. The drug induced feelings of\nconfidence and peace. Applicant stopped using marijuana completely in 2003 when he\nrealized he could not continue to live his life as he had been, and marijuana had turned\nhim into a person he did want to be. Applicant had difficulty giving up the drug but dealt\nwith cravings through prayer. He sought no professional help to deal with what he\nconsidered to be a psychological addiction. Applicant no longer has any cravings or\n\nApplicant indicated on his December 2004 SF 86 (Item 5) that he earned his high school diploma from an\n1\nacademy in Florida in September 2002. Neither his address nor work history show any other connection to\nFlorida. \n3\ndesires to smoke marijuana and he does not associate with those friends with whom he\nused marijuana in the past. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future.\nAt age 18, Applicant went to work as a sales associate at a toy store. He stayed\nin that job for only a few months. From January 2002 to May 2002, he worked as a cook\nat a restaurant, but was unemployed for two years thereafter.  In June 2004, he got a\n1\njob as a porter at a car dealership but he did not report back to work in July 2004 after\nsome time off for a family funeral. In November 2004, he was hired by his current\nemployer as a light truck driver on a military installation.\nNeeding a security clearance for his duties, Applicant completed a security\nclearance application on December 7, 2004. He indicated he had been fired from his\nemployment with the car dealership in July 2004, but responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 27\n[\u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used\nany controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?\u201d] (Item 5).\nOn May 17, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator about his use of marijuana and possible falsification of\nhis security clearance application. Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana in rolled\njoints, approximately every other day from his early teens until he was 18. He described\nhis use as sporadic thereafter. Applicant indicated it would be difficult to gauge the\naverage frequency of his use, as he \u201cmight use it ten times one month and twice\nanother month.\u201d Applicant could not recall the month of his last use, but averred he\nstopped using marijuana in 2003. Applicant denied any intent to use marijuana or other\nillegal drug in the future. Applicant also denied any ongoing contact with his former\nfriends who had witnessed his marijuana use. As for his failure to disclose his marijuana\nuse on his SF 86, Applicant told the investigator that he did not list his marijuana use\nbecause he really needed work and also he was not thinking as clearly as he now does.\nAlso asked about the loss of his job at the car dealership, Applicant related he assumed\nhe had been fired after he failed to return to work following his cousin\u2019s funeral, although\nhe never was notified directly. Applicant did not provide a written statement during his\ninterview, but the investigator codified Applicant\u2019s personal testimony in a written report\ntransmitted May 30, 2007 (Item 6).\nIn August 2007, DOHA furnished Applicant with a copy of the OPM investigator\u2019s\nreport of the subject interview and asked him to authenticate it. On August 17, 2007,\nApplicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to whether the report of investigation accurately reflects the\ninformation he had provided to the authorized investigator on the day he was\ninterviewed (Item 6).\n\n4\nOn November 19, 2007, DOHA issued an SOR, notifying Applicant of security\nconcerns because of his marijuana use to 2003 and his failure to disclose that\ninvolvement on his security clearance application (Item 1). On December 7, 2007,\nApplicant admitted \u201cto experimenting with [the] drug in high school but not to using it on\na frequent basis.\u201d Applicant denied any intentional concealment, stating in part:\nI would not intentionally withhold any information that would prevent me in\nreceiving a security clearance or jeopardize my employment. I answered\nNo because I haven\u2019t used drugs since 2003. The timeframe [sic] was an\noversight on my part.\nItem 4.\nIn rebuttal to the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant acknowledged he had not\nprovided accurate information regarding his past drug use on his SF 86, but denied it\nwas deliberate (\u201cI did not intentionally conceal my past drug use as I understand in so\ndoing it would preclude any employment that requires a security clearance.\u201d Ex. A).\nApplicant averred he was no longer the same person that he was when he had used\nmarijuana:\nWhen I experimented with illegal drugs I was young, easily persuaded and\na very confused individual. However, I no longer use illegal drugs nor do I\nassociate with individuals who participate in that type of activities. Also, I\nno longer suffer from depression and my quality of life and living\nconditions and environment has improved for the best. I currently reside in\n[city and state omitted] in an apartment of my own. I am a Christian and\nregularly attend [church name and location omitted]. I also attend bible\nstudy and other Christian events.\nApplicant denied any intent to return to his former lifestyle and indicated he did not want\n\u201cpast indiscretions\u201d to negatively impact his career or future (Ex. A).\nAs a warehouse specialist for a defense contractor, Applicant issues mandatory\nsupplies and equipment to military personnel deploying overseas. Applicant has\ndemonstrated honesty, reliability, and dependability over the past three years. In the\nopinion of a unit security manager familiar with Applicant\u2019s work, Applicant has \u201cgreat\nintegrity\u201d and is extremely dedicated to his family and work. She has observed nothing\nover her three years\u2019 association with him that causes her security concerns (Ex. C).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant smoked marijuana in high school, as frequently as every other day at\ntimes. After he turned 18, his use of marijuana became more sporadic, but it continued\nuntil sometime in 2003. Applicant exercised unquestionably poor judgment in using\nmarijuana during his adolescence and as a young adult. It falls within the overall\nsecurity concern underlying AG \u00b6 15. AG \u00b6 16(g) (association with persons involved in\ncriminal activity) is also implicated. Applicant purchased marijuana, and those\nacquaintances who provided him with the drug committed criminal conduct.\nHowever, the Government\u2019s evidence does not support its reliance on AG \u00b6\n16(c). Under AG \u00b6 16(c) there must be \u201ccredible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any\nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s lack of\ncandor about his drug use warrants an adverse determination (see Guidelines E and J,\ninfra), so AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply on its face.\nThe Government had the evidence to allege drug-related judgment concerns\nunder Guideline H AG \u00b6 25 (a) (any drug abuse) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). An assessment that Applicant\u2019s drug\nabuse was not sufficient for an adverse determination under Guideline H\u2014a threshold\nfinding for AG \u00b6 16(c) to apply to his drug use\u2014would mean that Applicant met one or\nmore of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. Apparently the Government was\nsatisfied that Applicant\u2019s drug abuse either happened so long ago (see AG \u00b6 26(a)), or\nApplicant demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future by dissociating\nhimself from drug-using contacts (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(1)), changing his environment (see\nAG \u00b6 26(b)(2)), abstaining for an appropriate period (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)), or executing a\nsigned statement of intent (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(4)). Lifestyle changes sufficient to mitigate\nthe judgment concerns under Guideline H (see AG \u00b6 24, \u201cUse of an illegal drug . . .\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\n\n7\nregulations\u201d), should be sufficient to mitigate the drug-related judgment issues\nunderlying Guideline E (see AG \u00b6 15, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment . . . or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). The\nGovernment has not explained its seemingly inconsistent position. Applicant has\nexercised good judgment in maintaining a drug-free lifestyle for the past four years (see\nAG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur),\ndissociating himself from known drug users (see AG \u00b6 17(g) (association with persons\ninvolved in criminal activity has ceased), and forswearing any future drug involvement to\novercome any residual concerns for his judgment caused by his past drug use.  \nHowever, the Government established its case for disqualification under AG \u00b6\n16(a). Personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana to as\nrecently as 2003 fell within the scope of question 27 (since age 16 or in the last seven\nyears) of the SF 86 he completed in December 2004. Applicant does not contest that he\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the drug inquiry, but submits he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86.\nWhen he answered the SOR, Applicant indicated he failed to note the time frame in the\nquestion (Item 4). In rebuttal to the FORM, he admitted he \u201cneglected\u201d to provide\naccurate information about his drug use on his SF 86, but persisted in denial of\nintentional falsification (\u201cI did not intentionally conceal my past drug use as I understand\nin doing so it would preclude any employment that requires a clearance.\u201d Ex. A). The\nrecord evidence instead shows that Applicant deliberately concealed his drug abuse.\nWhen first questioned about the possible falsification of his SF 86, Applicant told the\nOPM investigator in May 2007 that he did not list his marijuana use on his SF 86\nbecause he needed the work (Item 6). His false answer to question 27 was knowing and\nwilful.\nApplicant is credited with acknowledging his marijuana use and providing some\ndetails about his drug involvement during his May 2007 interview, although he was\nunable to recall the month of his last use of marijuana or to estimate the frequency of\nhis abuse after age 18. It also does not appear that Applicant disclosed his drug\ninvolvement before being confronted, which is required under AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts\u201d). Moreover, after becoming aware that his false\nresponse to the drug inquiry could cost him a clearance, Applicant compounded the\ndoubts about his judgment in refusing to take responsibility for his false statement on his\nSF 86 and in minimizing the extent of his marijuana abuse in high school. Marijuana use\non the order of every other day or up to ten times per month cannot reasonably be\ncharacterized as experimental. None of the mitigating conditions apply to his deliberate\nfalse statements.\n\n8\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nWhen Applicant signed his security clearance application in December 2004, he\ncertified that his statements on the form and any attachments were \u201ctrue, complete and\ncorrect to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith,\u201d and that\nhe understood that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by a fine or\nimprisonment or both. By deliberately falsifying his response to question 27, Applicant\nviolated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which provides in pertinent part:\na) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowing and willfully: (1) falsifies,\nconceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact: (2)\nmakes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document\nknowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\nthan 5 years, or both.\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) are\npertinent in evaluating Applicant\u2019s current security suitability. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s SF 86 falsification occurred more than three years ago, his\nrecent denials of intentional concealment and fabricated excuses preclude me from\nconsidering AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). Applicant\u2019s favorable work reference is not enough to satisfy AG \u00b6 32(d)\n(\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d).\nAs noted above, Applicant presented inconsistent explanations in 2007 for his failure to\ndisclose his illegal drug involvement on his SF 86. Applicant has not yet demonstrated\nthat his representations can be relied on.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse was serious,\nbut it ceased before he turned 21 (see AG \u00b6 2(4)). Applicant was only 21 when he lied\nabout his drug use on his SF 86. Applicant could have gone a long way toward\ndemonstrating the maturity and judgment that must be demanded of those with a\nclearance had he acknowledged his falsification and expressed appropriate remorse in\nhis Answer or even in his rebuttal to the FORM. Instead he put his self-interest before\nhis obligation of candor. Based on the record before me, I am unable to conclude that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Voelker, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on January 5, \n2007.  On September 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant \nunder Guidelines B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2007.  She answered \nthe SOR in writing through counsel on November 14, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on November 19, 2007.  \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 7, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nDepartment counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on January 8, 2008, and I \nreceived the case assignment on February 5, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non February 7, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2008.  The \ngovernment submitted four exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted in to the record without objection.  Applicant and four witnesses \ntestified on her behalf.  Applicant submitted 26 Exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through Y, which were admitted in to the record without objection.  DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 14, 2008.  Based on a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment counsel requested I take administrative notice of certain facts \npertaining to the People Republic of China (PRC).1  The facts administratively noticed \nmust be limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute.  Attached to that request are six State Department or Intelligence documents \ndepartment counsel presented to establish the facts requested to be administratively \nnotice.  Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the use of one of the documents, \u201cThe \nIntelligence Threat Handbook\u201d.2  Applicant\u2019s counsel objected that the document was \nold having been authored in 2003, written by a contractor to the intelligence community, \nand only based on a series of articles or scholarly papers.  The request and the \nattached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as \nGovernment Exhibit 1.  The documents will be used to assist me in determining the \nfacts appropriate for administrative notice.3  As noted in the Findings of Fact, I gave \nsome weight to the information contained in \u201cThe Intelligence Threat Handbook\u201d. \n \nMotion to Amend SOR: \n \n \nDepartment counsel withdrew the allegation under Guideline C, Foreign \nPreference.  The security concern and allegations were based on Applicant\u2019s \npossession of a Peoples Republic of China (PRC) issued passport.  Applicant destroyed \nher PRC passport.4  The lack of a current foreign passport negates the security \nconcern.  I granted department counsel\u2019s request to withdraw the allegation under \nGuideline C and the allegations will not be discussed further in this decision.5 \n \n \n1 Tr.8-10; Government Exhibit 1 (Request for Administrative Notice, dated January 10, 2008). \n \n2 Tr. 10-13; Applicant Exhibit A (Objection to Administrative Notice, dated February 4, 2008).   \n \n3 Tr. 14-15. \n \n4 Applicant Exhibit B (Facility Security Officer Letter, dated November 14, 2007). \n \n5 Tr. 16-17. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the SOR \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d.  She provided additional information to support her \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old software developer for a defense contractor working on \nmilitary medical information programs.  She was born in the PRC and has been married \nfor over 20 years to a man also born in the PRC.  Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin history in the PRC, and then taught history at the college level.  When she came to \nthe United States, her spoken English was not sufficient for her to teach.  She went to a \nUnited States university and earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science which \nenabled her to be employed by her present employer.  Her husband had a master\u2019s \ndegree in international trade from a PRC university.  Her husband came to the United \nStates in 1991 for school.  He received a master\u2019s degree in computer science from a \nUnited States university.  He works in this field but not in the defense industry.  He \nnever submitted an application for a security clearance.6  She and her husband have a \n19-year-old son born in the PRC and now a college student.  Applicant\u2019s husband and \nson are citizens and residents of the United States.7   \n \nApplicant lived with her mother in the PRC until she married in 1987.  She and \nher husband lived together in the PRC until he left for schooling in the United States in \n1991.  Applicant followed her husband as a student to the United States in 1992.  Their \nson stayed in the PRC with his paternal grandparents until 1996 when he joined his \nparents in the United States.  Applicant and her husband were able to stay in the United \nStates after school and apply for permanent residency.  They received their green cards \nin February 2001.8  Applicant and her husband applied for United States citizenship \ntogether.  Applicant received her United States citizenship on June 29, 2006.  Her \nhusband had to wait another year for a quota to open and became a United States \ncitizen in February 2007.9  Both were issued United States passports in May 2007.10  \nShe used her passport to travel to the PRC later that year.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was a university finance professor, and her mother an English \nteacher at the middle school level.  She had two older brothers.  He mother came from \na wealthy family, but contracted meningitis as a teen-ager.  Applicant, as an infant, was \n \n6 Tr. 109-110. \n \n7 Government Exhibit 2 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP, dated January 5, \n2007). \n \n8 Tr. 60-67, 121-122; Applicant Exhibit B (Naturalization Certificate, dated July 2, 1999). \n \n9 Applicant Exhibit D (Naturalization Certificate, dated February 6, 2007). \n \n10 Government Exhibit 3 (Interrogatory with passports, dated August 27, 2007). \n \n11 Tr. 66-67, 121. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncared for every day by nannies.  From the age of 3 to 7 years old, she was cared for in \na boarding style school during the week and returned to her family on the weekends.  \nHer father and the family were sent to the countryside under Chinese communist \ngovernment policy.  Her father worked as a farmer as required by the PRC communist \ngovernment.  While in the countryside, her mother could not work because of her \nmeningitis. Her father took care of the family and Applicant was required to assist him.  \nHer parents fought all of the time and the family situation was not happy.  Her father \ndied in 1972 when he became sick and there was inadequate medical care at their \ncountryside location.12  \n \nApplicant, her mother, and one of her brothers were moved back to the city by \nher father\u2019s former university after he died.  Her other brother was a teenager and \nrequired by the communist policy to remain in the countryside for three more years to \nwork as a farmer.  He was eventually able to attend school and later opened his own \nbusiness.  In the city, Applicant, her mother, and brother lived in the basement of an \napartment building housing university personnel.  The area assigned to them by the \nuniversity was originally the public bath area but was now used to house six or seven \nfamilies in a communal small area.  There was a shared toilet but no cooking facilities.  \nApplicant had to take care of the domestic chores because her mother was working or \ntoo sick or working to do them.  Her mother was able to find work teaching in a middle \nschool.  Applicant had to request permission from other families in the building to use \ntheir kitchen facilities to prepare food for her mother and brother.  It was not a happy \ntime because of her chores and the requirement to use common facilities from other \nfamilies.  She did not have a good relationship with her mother.13  Typical Chinese \nculture is for the son to take care of parents.  In her case, she took care of her mother.14 \n \nApplicant lived there for three years until she completed middle school at age 17 \nor 18, and then was required to go to the countryside per the PRC policy.  She lived \nwith other girls in a dormitory setting for over three years.  During that time, she had no \ncontact with her mother.  She wanted to attend college, so she studied, received a high \nscore on the college admission tests, and was permitted to attend college.  Her \nmother\u2019s housing improved and the mother moved to a one bedroom apartment.  \nApplicant lived with her mother for a few months until college started.  In college, she \nlived in the dormitory but went home to help her mother on weekends.  Her relationship \nwith her mother did not improve.  She started college in September 1979 and worked in \nthe school cafeteria to pay for college.  She received a degree in history in 1983 and \nwent to work as a university history professor.  She continued to live with and care for \nher mother.  She did not encounter any problems as a university professor during the \nissues raised by the rebellion in the PRC in 1989.15 \n \n12 Tr. 68-72. \n \n13 Tr. 72-77. \n \n14 Tr. 118-119. \n \n15 Tr. 77-81; 116-124. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nSince she came to the United States, she has returned to PRC twice to visit her \nmother, in 2001 and 2007.  She usually calls her mother about every two months.  Her \nmother is hard of hearing so the conversations are usually one way with her mother \ndoing the talking.  However, she has not talked to her in some time.  She did not call her \nfor the Chinese New Year this year.  Her mother broke both hips at different times but \nshe did not go to the PRC to visit her on either occasion.  She also sent her mother \n$200 one time to assist with some of her medical costs when she broke her hip the first \ntime.16 \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers and his wife now live with her mother.  He was an \naccountant with a chemical factory.  The factory was controlled by another company \nthat was affiliated with the communist government.  He is retired because he has kidney \ndisease.  Applicant talks to this brother a few times a years. She did not call him this \nChinese New Year because she knew her sister-in-law would pressure her to bring her \nmother to the United States so Applicant could care for her.  Applicant does not want \nher mother to live with her.  She feels no obligation to care for her mother because she \ncared for her when she was young and she is in the United States and not in the PRC.  \nSince her brothers are in the PRC she believes they should care for their mother.  Her \nbrother got a computer in 2003, and they experimented communicating by e-mail.  After \na few attempts at communication, they did not use the e-mail any longer.  At present, \nApplicant believes her brother no longer has e-mail capability.  Her brother has a \ndaughter who is a nursing student in the United States.  She has no contact with her \nniece.  She believes the niece does not intend to return to the PRC when she completes \nher nursing degree this year.17 \n \nApplicant\u2019s other brother is an interior decorator with his own business in the \nPRC.  She also only talks to him occasionally on holidays.  He is married with one son \nin the PRC.  She last talked to this brother in 2007 when she needed his address to \ncomplete her security clearance application.18 \n \nApplicant states her relationship with her mother and brothers in the PRC are not \nclose.  She describes them as  \n \n\u201c. . . not close, not communicate a lot. . . . They have very tight relationship, \n  knows each other very well, but I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  Very slow,  \nthe reaction between me and my mother or brothers, the information no.\u201d   \n \nHer family in the PRC share information between themselves but they do not \nshare information with her.19 \n \n16 Tr. 81-85, 124-125. \n \n17 Tr. 85-91, 122-126. \n \n18 Tr. 91-94; See also, Government Exhibit 4 (Response to Interrogatories, dated August 27, 2007). \n \n19 Tr. 130-131. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has friends in the United States who question why she makes so few \ntrips to the PRC to see her mother.20  Applicant\u2019s first trip back to the PRC since leaving \nin 1992 was in 2001 for 18 days.  Applicant was not a United States citizen at the time.  \nShe only had a PRC passport which she used on the trip.  Applicant was accompanied \nby her son.  They stayed with her mother for part of the trip because Applicant became \nsick.  Her son went on a tour so he was not with them for the entire trip.  She saw her \none brother who stayed with her mother but not her other brother.  She did not see any \nof her friends from the PRC or have any contact with PRC officials.21 \n \nHer next trip was in 2007.  Applicant made the trip because she wanted to see \nher mother who she had not seen in six years, she wanted to motivate her son since he \nwas not acclimating to college by letting him travel in China, and a direct inexpensive \nflight was available.  She was a United States citizen so she traveled on her United \nStates passport.  She stayed for 22 days, and went sightseeing with her son.  She also \nvisited her mother and brother but stayed in a local hotel.  She also visited her other \nbrother and his family.  She has no intention of returning to the PRC except to attend \nher mother\u2019s funeral when she passes away.22 \n \nApplicant owns no property in the PRC.  She and her husband own the house in \nthe United States that the family lives in.23  Applicant and her husband also own rental \nproperty.24  Applicant and her husband have their assets in United States banks and in \nretirement accounts.25  Her activities, other than work, are with her church and \nswimming at the local swim club.  She does not like the PRC communist government.  If \nshe were approached by them about revealing information, she would notify her security \nofficer.26 \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s father died in 1997.  Only her husband returned to the \nPRC for the funeral.  His mother passed away in 2002 and again only he returned to the \nPRC for the funeral.  Applicant\u2019s husband has two brothers who are residents and \ncitizens of the PRC.  One is a doctor and the other an emergency medical technician.  \nNeither works for the PRC government.  She does not know her brothers-in-law and \ndoes not talk to them.  Her husband talks to his brothers by telephone about twice a \nyear.27 \n \n20 Tr. 94-96. \n \n21 Tr. 96-99. \n \n22 Tr. 99-105. \n \n23 Applicant Exhibit O (Tax bill, 2007-2008). \n \n24 Applicant Exhibit P (Tax bill, 2007-2008); Applicant Exhibit Q (Lease, dated July 1, 2007). \n \n25 See, Applicant Exhibits R-W (Financial account statements). \n \n26 Tr. 105-111. \n \n27 Tr. 113-116. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nA witness who is a naturalized United States citizen since at least 1963 testified \nhe has known Applicant socially for over seven years.  He has held a security clearance \nfor over 35 years and has worked for government agencies.  He sees Applicant often \nand has attended social functions with her.  She does not talk often about her mother in \nthe PRC.  He knows she respects her mother but they have a distant relationship.  He \nknows Applicant to be reliable, honest, and trustworthy.  He recommends she be \ngranted a security clearance.28 \n \nAnother witness testified he retired from the Army after serving on active duty for \nover 24 years.  He now works with Applicant in a government agency as an information \ntechnology specialist.  He has held a security clearance since he served on active duty.  \nHe has known Applicant for over 5 years and sees her on a daily basis.  They \noccasionally have lunch together.  He believes she is trustworthy, reliable, and should \nbe granted a security clearance.29 \n \nAnother witness testified that she is an information technology specialist for the \ngovernment agency that Applicant\u2019s employer supports.  She has held a security \nclearance for over five years, and has known Applicant for those five years.  She and \nApplicant interact extensively at work on a daily basis.  She has met Applicant\u2019s \nhusband and son.  Applicant does not talk frequently about her family in the PRC.  She \nknows Applicant has a mother and siblings in the PRC.  Applicant has commented to \nthe witness that the witness is close to her mother but that she, Applicant, is not close to \nher mother.  The witness knows Applicant travels less back to the PRC than other \nemployees in the government agency who are also from the PRC.  Applicant asks her \nabout United States cultural issues to learn more about them.  She knows Applicant had \nan interim security clearance and that she had no issues with classified information \nwhile holding the clearance.  She believes Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and reliable, \nand should be granted access to classified information.30  \n \nAnother witness testified that she is Applicant\u2019s neighbor and knows the family \nvery well.  Their children swim together and the families socialize together.  She \nconsiders Applicant to be her best friend.  She knows Applicant has a mother and \nsiblings in the PRC.  Applicant only mentioned her mother to the witness once and told \nher that her mother stays in bed and is sick.  She never talks about her brothers.  \nApplicant is very interested in United States culture and food.  She cooks Chinese food \nfor her family since her husband is a vegetarian.  She believes Applicant has \nestablished her ties to the United Sates by not selling but renting her former townhouse \nresidence.  Applicant has never expressed a desire to return to the PRC.

He \nrecommends her for a security clearance.33  Her project manager states she is \ntrustworthy, honest, steady and a reliable worker.  She pays attention to detail and is \nenthusiastic about her work.  She considers the United States to be her home and \nrarely talks about China.  He is a Chinese American and knows most other Chinese \nAmericans travel to China every year or two to see family.  Applicant returns to China \nless than them and has only traveled to China twice.  He recommends her for a security \nclearance.34  Applicant was also commended for her work in establishing a computer \nsystem to assist with evaluation of student examinations performed by the government \nagency she supports.35  Her pastor noted that she is active in church ministries.  He \nfinds her honest, responsible, and trustworthy.36 \n \n \nChina, also known as the People's Republic of China, is hostile to the United \nStates, and has interests inimical to those of the U.S.  China is ruled by a totalitarian \ngovernment that depends on the suppression of its people. The government has a poor \nrecord of human rights that features, among other things, repression of political and \nreligious dissenters.  There have been some improvements in relations between the \nPRC and the United States.  While the United States looks forward to a constructive \nand broad-based relationship with China, a message reiterated by President Bush when \nhe met with PRC President Hu in April 2006, there are areas of potential disagreement.  \nThe PRC is not listed by the United States as a sponsor of terrorism.37 \n \n \nChina is known to engage in espionage against the United States, economically, \nmilitarily, and otherwise.  The United States is a primary intelligence target of PRC \nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military, \npolitical, and economic presence in Asia and the Pacific Rim; its role as a developer of \nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry who are considered prime intelligence targets by the \n \n31 Tr. 52-58. \n \n32 See, Applicant Exhibits H-M (Performance Appraisals from 2002 until 2007). \n \n33 Applicant Exhibit E (Letter, dated February 22, 2008). \n \n34 Applicant Exhibit F (Letter, dated February 20, 2008). \n \n35 Applicant Exhibit G (Letter, dated September 29, 2004). \n \n36 Applicant Exhibit X (Letter, dated January 5, 2008). \n \n37  Applicant Exhibit Y (Department of State lists of countries sponsoring terrorism). \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nPRC.  The intelligence practice of the PRC is different from the Soviet and western \nconcept of the use of recruited agents.  The western approach is to recruit agents for a \nspecific intelligence target.  The PRC intelligence philosophy is to try to recruit agents \nbefore there is a specific need, and recruit as many as possible.  The crux of the PRC \napproach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability, but to appeal to an individual\u2019s \ndesire to help China out in some ways.  A large portion of the PRC intelligence \ncollection efforts against common targets is conducted directly by PRC students, \ndelegations, and commercial enterprises.  The PRC also believe if large numbers of \nChinese leave China and settle permanently in the United States, some of them may \nsome day find their way into positions of intelligence potential.  When they are in \nposition, these individuals will be approached on the basis of loyalty to their ancestral \nland, and some may be persuaded to cooperate, at least on a limited basis.38 \n \n \nChinese security personnel place foreign visitors under surveillance and subject \nthem to search without their knowledge or consent.  However, there is no information in \nintelligence documents that the PRC is targeting relatives of Chinese-Americans who \nlive in China to gain access to classified, technical, or business information from their \nrelatives in the United States.  However in recent years, the PRC has been the subject \nof approximately half of the cases initiated by U.S. law enforcement agencies \nconcerning the illegal diversion of technology from the United States.  These cases \ninvolve people born and raised in the PRC who immigrated to the United States and \nbecame United States citizens.  The PRC relies on recruitment and exploitation \noperations.  The PRC attempts to recruit or at least \u201cmake friends with\u201d as many \nChinese-Americans as possible, apparently hoping that at least some will perceive an \nobligation to help China,39 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n \n38 Government Exhibit 1 (Request for Administrative Notice, Intelligence Threat Handbook, at 17-24). \n \n39 Government Exhibit 1 (Request for Administrative Notice with Attached State Department and \nIntelligence documents).

This article outlines the PRC approach to intelligence \ngathering and lists the recent cases in the United States against PRC for spying). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B Foreign Influence: \n \n \nForeign influence is a security concern because an individual with foreign \ncontacts and interests may have divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, and thus \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial \ninterest is located, including but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.40 \n \n \nApplicant has contact with her mother, brothers, and sisters-in-law who are all \ncitizens and residents of the PRC.  These contacts may be minimal or infrequent, but \nthey raise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 7(a) \n(contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion); and AG \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband has two brothers that he talks to by telephone that are \ncitizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant does not talk to her brothers-in-law and \nthey are not alleged by the government to be a security concern.  However, because \nshe lives with her husband, I have also considered Foreign Influence Disqualifying \nCondition AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) and determine that it does not applies.  She does \nnot have contact with her brothers-in-law and her husband\u2019s contact with them is \ninfrequent so there is minimal if any risk of inducement, manipulation or coercion from \nthe presence of the brothers-in-law in the PRC. \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could created a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) and determine all apply to Applicant\u2019s contact with her mother, \nher siblings, and their wives. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The DOHA Appeal Board \nconsistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying \npremise was that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is \n \n40 AG \u00b6 6. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nforced to make a choice between the interest of the family member and the interest of \nthe United States.41  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to apply a \nbalancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the revised guidelines, \nhowever, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed and balanced to determine \nif an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the United States \ninterest. \n \n \nThe nature of the country in which persons are located is an issue.  There are \nsome indications that China and the United States are working towards more friendly \nrelations.  But there is no doubt the PRC targets the United States for scientific, \nintelligence, technical, and military information.  Security concerns can be raised from \ncountries both friendly and hostile to the United States.  The United States has an \ninterest in protecting its classified information whether the person, organization, or \ncountry seeking the information has interests inimical to the United States.42  Friendly \ncountries can have disagreements with the United States over matters that are vital to \nthe national security of the United States.  Friendly countries have engaged in \nespionage against the United States while seeking economic, scientific, and technical \ninformation.43  The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., its \nhuman rights record, and its intelligence collection methods are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government \ncoercion.  The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is dependent on or \nassociated with the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S.  Applicant has a heavy burden to establish that the nature of \nthe PRC activities do not create a security concern. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is elderly and in poor health.  She worked as a school \nteacher, when she worked.  She did not work for the government, but does have a small \npension from her work as a teacher. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her mother has never \nbeen close since she was required to care for the family and her mother under adverse \nconditions.  She does not want her mother to come to the United States.  She believes it \nis sufficient for her brothers to care for their mother in the PRC.  Applicant has only \nvisited her mother twice in the over 16 years since she left the PRC.  They talk by \ntelephone only occasionally, and have not talked in about a year.  Applicant did not call \nher mother this year for the Chinese New Year.  Their contact is infrequent and one \nsided since her mother is hard of hearing.  She sent money to help with her mother\u2019s \nmedical costs only once and has not sent her funds in many years.  She only \ncommunicates with her brothers about once a year and has not talked to them recently.  \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with her mother and siblings in the PRC are infrequent and \n \n41 See, ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. \n21. 2005).   \n \n42 ISCR Case No. 02-11570, (App. Bd. May 19, 2004) at 5. \n \n43 ISCR Case No. 00-0317, (App. Bd. May 29, 2002).   \n\n \n13 \n \n \nminimal.  Applicant has a sense of obligation to her mother since she plans to attend \nher funeral.  This sense of obligation is balanced with her two visits to see her mother in \nover 20 years.  However, since her mother and siblings are family members, their \ncontact cannot be considered casual, even though the contacts are infrequent, minimal, \nand she has no desire to bring her mother to the United States to live with her.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two trips to the PRC do not show an interest in the PRC but were \ntaken to visit her mother and let her son visit and see the sights of China.  She travels \nback to the PRC less than normal for immigrants from the PRC.  She did not contact old \nfriends and had no contact with government agents during her travels there.  The trips \nwere not made because of a desire to see the PRC or for government purposes, but for \nfamily purposes, both for her mother and her son.  The trips do not create a conflict of \ninterest.  \n  \n \nThe government documents used for administrative notice purposes show that \nthe PRC approach to intelligence gathering is different than the western approach.  The \nPRC does not target people, like her family members, to pressure or coerce to reveal \ninformation not in the U.S. interests.  In balancing the nature of the contacts and visits \nwith her family in the PRC, and the intelligence approach of the PRC against Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the United States, I determine that Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by the PRC, and cannot be manipulated or induced to help PRC in a way that \nis against U.S. interest because some family members are in the PRC. \n \n \nThe PRC approach to intelligence gathering does seem to target individuals of \nChinese ancestry who live in the United States.  The administrative judge must again \nbalance the nature of the loyalty of the individual to the United States against her loyalty \nto the PRC.  In this case, Applicant has a strong sense of loyalty to the United States \nand little if any loyalty or love for the PRC.  She and her family suffered under PRC rule.  \nHer father was forced to move the family to the countryside and work as a farmer.  Her \nmother was sick and could not assist the family, with the burden falling on Applicant\u2019s \nfather and herself.  Her father suffered in the countryside and died of inadequate \nmedical care.  After the death of her father, the family lived in substandard conditions in \nthe city.  Again, the burden fell on Applicant to maintain the family\u2019s elements of daily \nliving.  She was finally able to complete her education but still could not fulfill her career \ngoals.  She came to the United State and she and her family have made a life for \nthemselves here.  She has no financial interests in the PRC with all of her property and \ninvestments here.  Her work performance is excellent and her co-workers and \nsupervisors consider her honest, trustworthy and reliable.  She became a United States \ncitizen and travels on her United States passport.  Applicant\u2019s life under the PRC is one \nof suffering and deprivations while her life in the United States is one of opportunity and \nprosperity.  She sees the United States as offering her an opportunity to reach her \npotential, and has a deep sense of loyalty and admiration for the United States and its \nway of life.  Applicant established herself and her family in the United States and \nbecame an integral member of United States culture and society.  She has shown her \nlack of feeling for the PRC because of her life and experiences under PRC government \npolicies, the infrequency of her trips back to her native country, and her lack of contacts \n\n \n14 \n \n \nwith anyone in the PRC.  Applicant has little if any sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nPRC.  A conflict of interest in this case is extremely unlikely.  In balancing Applicant\u2019s \ninterests, loyalty, obligations, and feeling for the PRC against her interests, loyalty, \nobligations, and feelings for the United States, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty, \nobligations, feelings, and interests to the United States is such that she can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the interest of the United States.  \nAccordingly, Applicant has met her heavy burden to show that her contacts in the PRC \ndo not cause a security concern, and that she cannot be pressured, coerced, or \nmanipulated by the PRC to act against United States interests.  I conclude AGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n(b), (c) are established and mitigate any security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I have considered the extent of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the PRC and her family and balance them against her ties to the \nUnited States.  I considered her work ethic and performance and the opinion of her co-\nworkers and her supervisors.  I considered the nature of the PRC, its intent to seek \ninformation from United States sources, and its methods of seeking protected or \nclassified information.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign \ninfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n15 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has close ties to family members in Guatemala, and his\nhandling of his tax matters raises doubts for his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 28, 2005. On November 19, 2007 (reissued December 14, 2007),\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B, Guideline F,\nGuideline J, and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\n \nApplicant submitted an initial response dated December 19, 2007. Before it was\nreceived, DOHA reissued the SOR on December 14, 2007. Applicant filed an Answer\ndated January 11, 2008, which was incomplete because he failed to indicate whether or\nnot he wanted a hearing. On January 31, 2008, Applicant annotated a copy of his\nJanuary 11 response and indicated he did not wish to have a hearing. On February 15,\n2008, the government notified Applicant of its request for a hearing before an\nadministrative judge under \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. On March 19, 2008, Department\nCounsel indicated the government was prepared to proceed. At the same time, she\nrequested administrative notice be taken of certain facts pertaining to the Republic of\nGuatemala (Guatemala). The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2008. On April 18,\n2008, I scheduled a hearing for May 8, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) were\nadmitted, including Applicant\u2019s December 19, 2007, response to the SOR (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was assisted in the presentation of his case by his spouse, and they both\ntestified on his behalf. Twelve Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-L) were also accepted into the\nrecord. A transcript of the hearing was received by DOHA on May 19, 2008.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open for him to document satisfaction\nof his federal tax debt and/or release of the federal tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. On\nMay 13, 2008, Applicant timely submitted four documents from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS). The government had no objections, and the documents were admitted as\nexhibits M, N, O, and P.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn March 19, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to Guatemala and its foreign relations, including with the\nU.S. The request was based on publications from the U.S. State Department. The\ngovernment\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. \nOn March 31, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were given until April 15, 2008, to file any\nobjections, and Applicant to also present alternative facts for notice. No responses were\nreceived by the due date. At the hearing, Applicant had no objections to the proposed\nfacts. I agreed to take administrative notice of particular facts pertaining to Guatemala,\nas set forth below.\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s spouse\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e) are Guatemalan citizens living legally\nin the U.S.; that his father (SOR \u00b6 1.b), his sister (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and five uncles (SOR \u00b6\n1.f) are resident citizens of Guatemala; that one uncle is a judge in Guatemala (SOR \u00b6\n1.g); that he owns real property in Guatemala valued at approximately $25,000 USD\n(SOR \u00b6 1.h); and that he traveled to Guatemala at least eight times between October\n2002 and May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations, that despite $2,635 per month in discretionary income (SOR \u00b6 2.b),\nApplicant has not satisfied a $9,768.14 tax lien filed January 2001 for failure to pay\nincome taxes due in May and July 1999 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Under Guideline J, criminal\nconduct, Applicant was alleged to have willfully failed to file federal (SOR \u00b6 3.b) and\nstate (SOR \u00b6 3.c) income tax returns for tax years 2004 and 2005, and to have not paid\nthe tax lien filed against him in January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his e-QIP by not disclosing\nthe outstanding federal tax lien (SOR \u00b6 4.a) and that he exercised poor judgment in not\nfiling his 2004 and 2005 tax returns and not paying his tax debt (SOR \u00b6 4.b).\nApplicant does not deny the Guatemalan citizenship and/or residency of his\nfamily members, nor the employment of one uncle as a judge in Guatemala. He also\nadmits the trips taken to Guatemala to visit family members, primarily his sister, and his\nownership of real estate in Guatemala. Applicant also acknowledges that he did not\ntimely file his federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2004 and 2005, but\ndenies any outstanding tax debt or knowing of a tax lien for taxes due in 1999 when he\nfiled his e-QIP. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old janitor who has worked for his current employer since\nDecember 2005 (Ex. 2, Tr. 50). He held an interim security clearance until April 2008\nwhen it was withdrawn pending final adjudication of his clearance. As a result, he\ncannot work later than 1900 hours (Tr. 4).\nApplicant was born in Guatemala in March 1967. He and his sister, who is two\nyears younger (Ex. 2), were raised by their maternal grandparents after his mother\nmoved to the U.S. without them when he was five years old (Tr. 47, 110-11).  He\nfinished college in Guatemala in about 1987 and then taught in an elementary school\n(Tr. 48).\nApplicant came to the U.S. in March 1989 (Tr. 46). He studied English as a\nsecond language at a college from about September 1989 to June 1990 (Ex. 2). It is not\nclear what Applicant did for work in the U.S., if anything, until September 1995, when he\nbegan cleaning for an oriental rug company. In April 1998, he began employment with a\nlandscape company (Ex. 2). In April 1999, he married his spouse, a Guatemalan citizen\nresiding in the U.S. She had been in the U.S. legally since March 1990 (Ex. 2, Tr. 49,\n\n4\n112-13). They have one child, a son, who was born in the U.S. in September 1999 (Ex.\n2).\nIn about March 1999, Applicant and his spouse bought their current residence,\nlocated down the street from her parents (Ex. 2). It is a duplex and they rent out the\nother half at $2,500 monthly (Tr. 80). Applicant started his own landscaping business\nout of his home in March 2000 (Ex. 2). His spouse helped with the business (Tr. 112 ).\nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 1997 in June 1999 (Ex.\nN). While he filed his 1998 federal tax return on time, he paid only $500 on a tax\nunderpayment of $5,902. He made payments of $650 in 1999 and $200 in 2000, which\nwere applied to his 1998 tax debt (Ex. O). On January 23, 2001, the IRS filed a federal\ntax lien in the amount of $9,768.14 against him for failure to pay balances of $5,351.81\nfor tax year 1997 (assessed July 26, 1999), and $4,416.33 for tax year 1998 (assessed\nMay 31, 1999) (Ex. M). By Applicant making regular payments and the IRS intercepting\nhis tax refunds for tax years 2000 and 2001, his federal tax debt was satisfied in 2002\n(Ex. N, Ex. O).\nIn February 2002, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He took an oath\nto renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its\nlaws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of\nthe U.S. if required. He was issued his U.S. passport on July 26, 2002. Also in 2002,\nApplicant won $1 million in the state lottery, paid to him at $50,000 annually (Ex. D, Ex.\nE, Tr. 68). In about 2005, Applicant and his spouse decided to build a home on a\nquarter acre plot of undeveloped land in Guatemala that his grandfather had given him\nin 1995 (Tr. 43, 67-68). It would give them a place to stay during visits and possibly in\nretirement (Tr. 67-68). \nDue to increased competition, his landscape company experienced a net loss of\nabout $22,699 during tax year 2004 (Ex. A, Ex. D). They decided to close the business,\nand ceased operating in October 2005 (Tr. 50-51). In December 2005, Applicant began\nworking for his present employer (Ex. 2, Tr. 50). On December 28, 2005, Applicant\ncompleted an e-QIP. He disclosed the Guatemalan citizenship and U.S. legal residency\nof his spouse and parents-in-law, and the Guatemalan citizenship and residency of his\nsister. He also indicated that his mother had acquired her U.S. citizenship in November\n1997 but that he did not know her address because he had no contact with her in a few\nyears. His father was listed as deceased with the following comment: \u201cI never knew my\nfather I was raised by my mother she never seen [sic] him again we have no information\nabout him. I am not sure if he is dead or alive.\u201d (Ex. 2) Applicant denies providing that\ninformation about his father, as his father lives in Guatemala and he visited with him\nduring most of his visits to Guatemala (Tr. 52-53). Applicant reported on his e-QIP his\nownership since September 1995 of less than an acre of land in Guatemala on which he\nwas building a home, and travel to Guatemala from October to November 2002,\nFebruary to March 2003, October to November 2003, in November 2004, December\n2004 to January 2005, May to June 2005, and August to September 2005. Applicant\n\nApplicant was likely referring to repayment of state tax delinquency. His March 2008 credit report (Ex. 4)\n1\nindicates that a state tax lien was filed against him in December 2006 for $5,4000 but that it was released in\nMay 2007.\n5\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to question 27c. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against\nyour property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d (Ex. 2).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on January 23, 2006, revealed that the IRS had filed\nthe federal tax lien of $9,768 in 2001. Disposition of the tax lien was indicated as \u201cUNK.\u201d\n(Ex. 5). During an interview of September 16, 2006, Applicant apparently indicated to a\ngovernment investigator that he had paid all his taxes except for 2004 and 2005. In\ninterrogatories, DOHA asked Applicant about whether he had satisfied his federal tax\nlien and filed his federal and state returns for tax years 2004 and 2005. DOHA also\nasked about his foreign financial assets and any foreign travel since August 2005. On\nAugust 15, 2007, Applicant indicated in response that he had made his last payment on\nthe federal tax lien debt in June 2007 (IRS records show satisfaction in 2002),  but he\n1\nhad not yet filed his federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2004 or 2005. He\nindicated he was still working on collecting the required documentation for his\naccountant. As for foreign assets, Applicant indicated he had only the property in\nGuatemala valued at about $25,000 USD. He also reported a recent trip to Guatemala\nin May 2007 to visit family (Ex. 3).\nBy early 2007, after spending about $20,000, Applicant and his spouse had\ntemporarily stopped construction of their home in Guatemala as they could not afford to\ncontinue. The residence has been framed with walls, but it lacks doors and windows (Tr.\n69).  Applicant now estimates the value of the partially developed property at $40,000-\n$45,000 USD (Tr. 70).\nIn December 2006, the state issued a tax lien against Applicant in the amount of\n$5,400.61 (Ex. 4, Ex. K, Tr. 78). The tax lien was released in May 2007 (Ex. K). On\nDecember 18, 2007, Applicant\u2019s accountant completed the federal and state joint\nincome tax returns for tax years 2004 (Ex. A, Ex. D, Ex. G, Ex. H), 2005 (Ex. B, Ex. E,\nEx. F), and 2006 (Ex. C, Ex. P). The returns were filed with the IRS on December 21,\n2007 (Ex. H, Ex. I, Ex. J, Ex. P). Applicant claimed his sister as a dependent on the\nreturns for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006, even though he testified she moved back to\nGuatemala about eight years ago (Tr. 55) and he does not support her (Tr. 58, 132).\nThey also claimed a small business loss of $679 (Ex. C) on their 2006 federal return\n(Ex. C) because of ongoing receipts and payments for the business (Tr. 133). Based on\nthe figures provided, Applicant was entitled to federal income tax refunds for all three\nyears (Ex. H, Ex. I, Ex. J). Applicant\u2019s accountant was still working on their tax returns\nfor 2007 as of May 7, 2008. The deadline for a timely submission had been extended\n(Ex. L).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse handles payment of their living expenses (Tr. 81). As of\nMarch 2008, Applicant owed no past due balances on any consumer credit accounts\n(Ex. 4).\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s sister returned to Guatemala in 2000 after living in the U.S. (Tr.  55).\nShe visited Applicant in the U.S. one time thereafter, in September 2001 (Tr. 57).\nApplicant stayed with his sister during each of his trips to Guatemala (Tr. 71-72). Her\nspouse owns a farm and she does not work outside of the home. When Applicant is not\nin Guatemala, he calls her once a month to once every two months (Tr. 42-43, 55-57).\nApplicant visited with his father during most of his trips to Guatemala (Tr. 52-53,\n74). He does not contact him otherwise (Tr. 52). Applicant has a half-brother in\nGuatemala who is a construction worker and lives in the area where Applicant grew up.\nApplicant sees him when he is in Guatemala (Tr. 54). Applicant has extended family in\nGuatemala whom he also visits when he is there. He is closest to a maternal uncle who\nis a judge (\u201ca pretty prestigious position\u201d) in Guatemala and visited with him on most of\nhis trips (Tr. 61-62). He does not contact him by phone often (Tr. 42). Applicant is\nunaware of the nature of his uncle\u2019s judicial duties (Tr. 60).  He has two other uncles in\nGuatemala who work as a welder and as a farmer, respectively. Applicant has not seen\neither of these uncles in a long time and does not contact them by telephone (Tr. 62). Of\nhis three aunts in Guatemala, two are retired teachers and one is a housewife.\nApplicant does not have ongoing contact with them (Tr. 62-64).\n \nApplicant intends future travel to Guatemala to visit his family members, but he\ndoes not have a trip scheduled at present (Tr. 75). Applicant\u2019s spouse intends to file for\nU.S. citizenship to ensure a better future for their son. She has waited to file until all\ntheir tax issues had been resolved (Tr. 113-14). Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents and\nsiblings are Guatemala citizens living in the U.S., although she was told by her parents\nthat they have applied for U.S. citizenship.  She has an aunt in Guatemala whom she\nmay see when she is in Guatemala (Tr. 115-16).  Applicant\u2019s spouse travels to\nGuatemala about once or twice a year, including by herself to give Applicant\u2019s sister\nmoney for materials for the home they are building (Tr. 117, 136).\n* * *\nGuatemala is a constitutional democratic republic with a legacy of violence and\nvigilante justice. While Guatemala generally respects the human rights of its citizens,\nthe country continues to experience serious human rights problems, including unlawful\nkillings and other improper conduct by security forces; widespread societal violence;\ncorruption and substantial inadequacies in the police and judicial sectors; criminal\nactivity by the police; arbitrary arrest and detention; and failure to protect judicial sector\nofficials, witnesses, and civil society organizations from intimidation. Democratic\ninstitutions in Guatemala have only a limited capacity to cope with common and violent\ncrime. On January 11, 2008, Guatemala and the United Nations inaugurated the work of\na joint International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.\nRelations between the U.S. and Guatemala traditionally have been close,\nalthough at times strained by human rights and civil/military issues. As a member of \u201cthe\nFriends of Guatemala,\u201d the U.S. played an important role in the UN-moderated peace\naccords which ended 36 years of internal armed conflict in Guatemala. The U.S.\n\n7\nsupports broad-based economic growth in Guatemala and Central American integration.\nGuatemala is a signatory to the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement and the\nU.S. is the country\u2019s largest trading partner. Guatemala and the U.S. cooperate in\ncombating money laundering, corruption, narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, and\nother transnational crimes, although severe resource constraints of both technology and\nmanpower, corruption, and an ineffective judicial system hindered Guatemala\u2019s efforts\nagainst transnational crime in 2006.  Guatemala also participates in several regional\ngroups, especially those related to trade and the environment. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n8\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse and her parents are citizens of his native Guatemala. There is\nlittle risk of undue foreign influence through his spouse or her relatives, given their\nlongtime U.S. residency and the fact that his spouse does not share close bonds with\nany Guatemalan resident citizens separate from those gained through her marriage to\nApplicant. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d) applies because of Applicant\u2019s ties in Guatemala. Shared\nexperiences with his sister under their grandparents\u2019 care forged a strong bond with her,\nas evidenced by his several visits to Guatemala to see her since she moved back to\nGuatemala. He and his spouse stay with her when they are in Guatemala, and\nApplicant calls her once a month to once every two months. Although he does not\ncontact other relatives by telephone, he visits with his father and also an uncle who is a\njudge when he is in Guatemala. Contact with his other uncles and his aunts in\nGuatemala is so casual and infrequent to raise little risk, however (see AG \u00b6 8(c)\n(\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Applicant\ntestified that he has had no contact for some time with these relatives.\nApplicant also owns a small parcel of land in Guatemala that was given to him by\nthe grandfather who raised him on which he and his spouse have started building a\n\n9\nhome. The government failed to establish how or why this partially developed property\npresents an unacceptable risk under Guideline B. There is no indication that the\nproperty is being used as any form of leverage against him. Furthermore, assuming\nApplicant\u2019s valuation is accurate, it is worth only between $40,000 and $45,000 USD. In\ncomparison to his U.S. assets (home ownership, rental income, employment earnings,\nand state lottery winnings) it is insubstantial (see AG \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature\nof the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to\nresult in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual\u201d).\nThe government also urges security concern because of Applicant\u2019s repeated\ntravel to Guatemala. Applicant took eight separate trips between October 2002 and May\n2007, primarily to see his sister and twice to attend funerals of family members. His\ntravel is relevant as it confirms his ties of affection and/or obligation to these foreign\nnationals, but there is no evidence that Applicant engaged in any conduct while in\nGuatemala that would warrant application of AG \u00b6 7(i) (\u201cconduct, especially while\ntraveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d).\nThe affection Applicant has for his sister in Guatemala heightens his vulnerability\nto undue foreign influence as does his uncle\u2019s position as a judge in Guatemala. AG \u00b6\n8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d) applies only to those relatives in Guatemala with whom he does\nnot share particularly close relations. Applicant testified that of his uncles and aunts in\nGuatemala, he is closest to this uncle who is connected to the Guatemalan government\nthrough its judiciary. The risk of undue foreign influence cannot be safely ruled out\nwhere Applicant described his uncle\u2019s position as \u201cpretty prestigious,\u201d and little more is\nknown. Applicant claims to not know the nature of his uncle\u2019s duties other than he works\nin the courts. Guatemala is not known to target U.S. sensitive information, and the U.S.\nand Guatemala have had historically good relations. However, even friendly countries\ndo not always share the same interests, and the Guatemala government fails to protect\nthe human rights of its citizens in several aspects.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence through his family members in\nGuatemala may yet be overcome by deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d). In some ways, Applicant is living the American\ndream even though he is not working in the teaching field.  He joined his mother in the\nU.S. in March 1989, and began working after an academic year of English language\nstudy. In 1999, he married his spouse, who remains a citizen of Guatemala but\n\n10\nimmigrated to the U.S. when she was 17 in 1990. In 2000, he started his own\nlandscaping business. While it was not as profitable as he had hoped, he won $1 million\nin a lottery. He and his spouse own their home in the U.S. In 2002, he became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. Yet, I am unable to conclude based on this record that his ties\nto the U.S. are deep and longstanding. He has strong bonds of affection with his sister.\nAll his recent vacations have been spent in Guatemala to visit his family.  He and his\nspouse have spent about $20,000 so far to build a home that they hope to stay in during\ntheir trips to Guatemala and possibly retire to.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe government\u2019s case under Guideline F is based solely on Applicant\u2019s alleged\nfailure to repay a federal income tax lien of $9,768.14 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) despite having about\n$2,635 monthly in discretionary funds (SOR \u00b6 2.b). IRS records show that the lien was\nfiled in January 2001 for failure to pay balances owed for tax years 1997 and 1998. He\ndid not pay the federal taxes owed for 1997 when he filed his return, and paid only $500\non a tax debt of $5,902 when he filed his return for 1998. He was assessed a late filing\npenalty for tax year 1997 because he did not file his return until June 2, 1999. AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d) apply.\nWhile the credit bureaus have yet to report the lien as satisfied (Ex. 4, Ex. 5), IRS\nrecords corroborate Applicant\u2019s claim that the debt has been paid through a\ncombination of payments and interception of tax refunds (see Ex. N, Ex. O).  Applicant\npaid $1,350 toward his tax debt for 1998 before the lien was filed. He has not\nadequately explained his failure to pay only $200 during calendar year 2000, but IRS\nrecords also confirm that after the tax lien, his spouse made regular payments on the\ntax debt starting in February 2001. Debt satisfaction in response to a tax lien does not\nfully qualify as a good-faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), but there are clear\nindications that his tax problems are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies because of\nsatisfaction of his delinquent tax debts and no evidence of any past due balances on\nother accounts. A state tax lien filed against Applicant in the amount of $5,400 in\nDecember 2006 (Ex. 4) was released in May 2007, and Applicant\u2019s spouse has been\n\nThe lien (Ex. M) was filed in accord with IRS regulation 301.6323(f)(1). Under the Internal Revenue Service\n2\nCode set forth in 26 C.F.R. Part 301, Section 301.6321 provides in part:\nIf any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the\namount (including interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together\nwith any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States\nupon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible,\nbelonging to such person.\n11\nmanaging their day-to-day expenses responsibly. Applicant\u2019s March 2008 credit report\n(Ex. 4) lists no delinquent consumer credit accounts.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline J, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30).  The government\nsubmits criminal conduct concerns are raised by Applicant\u2019s failure to pay income taxes\nassessed in 1999, which the record shows was for tax years 1997 and 1998 (SOR \u00b6\n3.a) and by his willful failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years\n2004 and 2005 by August 2007. Concerning the federal tax lien for failure to pay, the\ngovernment did not allege a specific statutory violation. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (see\nSOR \u00b6 3.b), the failure to file a required return and/or pay a required tax is punishable\nas a misdemeanor, provided a willful noncompliance:\nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or\nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to\nmake a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully\nfails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such\nrecords, or apply such information, at the time or times required by law or\nregulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty\nof a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more\nthan $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not\nmore than 1 year or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\nThe lien was issued under IRS regulation (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6321-1), which\nprovides a legal remedy to collect where a liable person neglects or refuses to pay\ntaxes after demand.  Failure to comply with a demand for taxes need not be willful for a\n2\nlien to issue. In this case, the evidence falls short of proving a willful failure to pay the\ntaxes for 1997 and 1998. Applicant made some payments on his tax debt for 1998\nbefore the lien was issued, which shows some effort to comply with his tax obligation.\nAs for his failure to timely file his returns for tax years 2004 and 2005 (and while\nnot alleged also 2006), the evidence shows he filed the returns in December 2007,\nshortly after he received the completed returns back from their accountant.\nUnquestionably, the returns were late. Both Applicant and his spouse testified that their\naccountant kept asking for additional documentation that it took some time to provide\n\nThe government did not allege any specific state law allegedly violated by Applicant in not filing his state\n3\nreturns on time.\n12\n(\u201cShe would tell me I need a statement, like bank statements from whatever, I would\nstart looking for those statements and bring it back to her.\u201d Tr. 129). In response to the\nseemingly unreasonable delay in furnishing the documentation, Applicant\u2019s spouse\nexplained that documents were destroyed in a flood in their home so she had to request\nand pay for records (Tr. 129). It must also be noted that the returns for 2005 and 2006\nwere complicated by the closure of his landscaping business. Applicant showed poor\njudgment in failing to ensure they were filed reasonably promptly (See Guideline E,\ninfra), but I am not persuaded he acted in willful disregard of his federal or state filing\nobligations.3\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for his security clearance in December 2005, he did not\nlist the federal tax lien that had been filed against him in January 2001, even though that\nlien should have been disclosed in response to question 27c. When he responded to\nthe SOR in December 2007 (Ex. 1), Applicant answered, \u201cI admit,\u201d but then claimed he\ndid not remember the lien (\u201cI\u2019m really sorry but I did not remembered [sic] at time.\u201d).\nAfter the SOR was reissued, Applicant denied knowing of the lien when he filed his e-\nQIP (\u201cI did not know that but we don\u2019t owe anything.\u201d Answer). When questioned about\nhis inconsistent explanations, Applicant testified, \u201cI was thinking you asked me if I owe\nthem that money to the IRS.\u201d He went on to indicate that he did not know about the lien\n(Tr. 86-87). He and his spouse both testified that they learned about the lien \u201clike two\nyears ago\u201d (Tr. 88, 111). Despite Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations, the government\nconceded in closing that it failed to establish deliberate falsification of the e-QIP since it\nwas not clear when Applicant learned of the federal tax lien (Tr. 146). After a review of\nthe evidence of record, I conclude the evidence falls short of proving the deliberate\nfalsification required under AG \u00b616(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d).\nThe IRS records show a levy notice was issued on January 18, 2001, and the tax\nlien on January 26, 2001. After making only one tax payment of $200 in May 2000,\n\n13\nApplicant\u2019s spouse began making monthly payments to the IRS in late February 2001. It\nis possible that these payments were in response to a levy notice, although that raises\nthe issue of how and why Applicant learned of the lien only two years ago, when the tax\ndebt had already been satisfied.  DOHA interrogatories indicate that Applicant was\ninterviewed in September 2006 by a government investigator and that he indicated he\nwas unaware of any tax liens against him.\nYet at the same time, security significant personal conduct concerns are raised\nunder AG \u00b6 16(d) (\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information\u201d) by Applicant\u2019s\nnegligence in handling his tax debt for 1997 and 1998 and in failing to ensure that his\ntax returns for 2004 and 2005 were filed reasonably promptly. Applicant knew or should\nhave known when he signed and submitted his income tax returns for tax years 1997\nand 1998 that he had substantially underpaid his federal income taxes for those years.\nHe paid an additional $650 in 1999 on his tax debt for 1998, but nothing on the tax debt\nin 1999. He paid only $200  toward his back taxes in 2000. His 2004 income tax return\nwas not filed until December 2007. It is difficult to believe that his spouse followed up\nwith their accountant at least once a month (Tr. 130) for that entire period.  Although the\ntaxes have been paid and all the delinquent returns have been filed, doubts persist\nabout his reform given he claimed his sister as a dependent on the joint income tax\nreturns for 2004, 2005, and 2006. Under IRS regulations, Applicant or his spouse was\nnot entitled to claim his sister as a dependent for those years unless she received over\nhalf of her support from him or her. Applicant\u2019s sister moved back to Guatemala in about\n2000 and they do not support her financially. When asked why they continued to claim\nhis sister as a dependent, Applicant\u2019s spouse responded, \u201cWe told her not to be a\ndependent anymore\u201d (Tr. 131) Neither Applicant nor his spouse offered a credible\nexplanation for why they signed and submitted the returns to the IRS claiming his sister\nas a dependent. The IRS records of their returns for 2004 (Ex. H), 2005 (Ex. I), and\n2006 (Ex. J) show four exemptions claimed each year with his sister as a dependent.\nEven if Applicant or his spouse had notified their accountant of the error, it does not\nrelieve them of their obligation to claim only those deductions to which they are legally\nentitled. Applicant\u2019s handling of his income tax returns raises significant doubt about\nwhether he takes his obligations of U.S. citizenship as seriously as he should.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\nTo the extent that the travel confirms his close relationships with some family members, it has been covered\n4\nunder SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g.\n14\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be in an\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s ties to primarily his sister in Guatemala, but also to\nhis father and an uncle, present an unacceptable risk of undue foreign influence. Doubts\nalso persist about his ability to abide by security regulations given the poor judgment\nexhibited in his handling of his tax issues.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant4\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n15\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his\napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 1, 2008. He answered it on\nApril 14, 2008 through his Counsel and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non July 16, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 14, 2008. Government\nExhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nOctober 24, 2008\n\nCounsel did not present a request for administrative notice for either France or Cameroon. Thus, I do not find or\n1\naddress any issues for those countries.\n2\nhis own behalf, and presented the testimony of two witnesses. Counsel submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (A-E), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Republic of Lebanon (Tr. 12). The request and the\nattached documents are included in the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Hence, the facts\nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not\nsubject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below.1\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a-1.l. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in\nmy findings of fact. I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old business man who owns a consulting firm working for a\ndefense contractor. He has worked on information management systems and\nengineering applications as a consultant on state government projects for 20 years. His\nwork involved sensitive but not classified information. He had an interim clearance for\none year in 2007 (Tr. 9). \nApplicant was born in and educated in Lebanon. He attended the American\nUniversity in Beirut, earning a B.S. in geology (Tr. 68). He was accepted into graduate\nschool in the United States in 1984. He received his PhD in 1994 from an American\nuniversity. He has resided in the U.S. for 24 years. Applicant has been a naturalized\ncitizen for 17 years (Tr. 73).   \nApplicant\u2019s last visit to Lebanon was in August 1999 and contrary to his family\u2019s\nwishes. His father was very ill and he wanted to visit him before he died. He experienced\nthe danger in Lebanon when a passenger on his plane was taken hostage. Applicant cut\nhis visit short and has never returned to Lebanon (Tr.). He uses his U.S. passport when\nhe travels. His Lebanese passport expired in 1997 and was surrendered to the Lebanese\ngovernment (AE A). He wishes to formally renounce his Lebanese citizenship. He has\nobtained the information concerning this formal process. A letter from the Secretary of\nState is required.\n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Lebanon. His father is deceased. His mother,\nwho is 73, lives with him in the U.S. She is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S. She\n\n3\nrarely visits Lebanon (Tr. 77). She receives a social security check from Lebanon and a\nsocial security from the U.S. Applicant provides for all of her daily living expenses.\nApplicant\u2019s mother inherited property in Lebanon when her husband died.\nApplicant is her only son and will inherit the home upon his mother\u2019s death. The value of\nthe property is approximately $180,000 (Tr. 77). Applicant believes he will dispose of the\nproperty when his mother dies. He has no interest in keeping it and considers it a burden\nrather than an asset (Tr. 75).\nApplicant\u2019s sister and her husband live in Lebanon and visit the U.S. annually.\nThey are dual citizens of Lebanon and France. They have three adult children who are\nU.S. permanent residents. They plan to retire in the U.S. (Tr. 79). His sister has applied\nfor permanent residency and wishes to become a U.S. citizen (Tr. 80). She visits her\nmother and her grown children in the U.S. about once a year (Tr. 81). Applicant\nsometimes speaks to his sister on the phone if she calls their mother. He has never\nvisited her in Lebanon (Tr. 96). His sister does not work and her husband is a doctor.\nApplicant has another sister who is divorced and lives in Cameroon. She owns a\nsmall business in that country. When his sister was in the process of obtaining a divorce\nmany years ago, Applicant provided some financial help (Tr.82). She left Lebanon about\nten years ago. He had not been in contact with her for many years but did visit her last\nyear in Cameroon. \nApplicant is divorced with two grown children. Since 2003, he has lived with his\nsignificant other who is a citizen of France and Lebanon. His partner was educated in\nFrance and is now a permanent resident of the U.S. (Tr. 44). He intends to apply for\ncitizenship in five years (Tr. 46). His partner also works for Applicant\u2019s company.\nApplicant\u2019s partner (P) has relatives in Lebanon. P\u2019s mother and three sisters live\nin Lebanon and are citizens of the country. P\u2019s mother is retired and lives at home and\nhis father is deceased (Tr. 48). P provides some financial support for his mother of\napproximately $5,000 a year. P\u2019s family members are aware of his work with Applicant\n(Tr. 51). Applicant\u2019s partner credibly testified that Applicant has a great pride in his U.S.\ncitizenship and desires to help the government with his projects. P does not believe that\nApplicant could be coerced or influenced into doing something that would harm the U.S.\ninterests because his loyalties are with his children and his mother in the U.S. P also\nowns property in France. Applicant met P\u2019s two sisters when they visited the U.S.\nApplicant met P\u2019s mother on three occasions in France on vacation. \n \nApplicant purchased a vacation home in France in 2003 (Tr. 84). He has a\nmortgage for the house and he has a bank account in France. He travels there every\nyear for vacation with P. The property is rented during the rest of the year. He has\ntraveled to France every summer from the last 1990's to the present. His adult children\nvisit with him there and they have a family vacation for a few weeks (Tr. 87). However,\none trip to France was with representatives from a U.S. geological survey team for work\npurposes. \n\n4\nApplicant has substantial real estate in the U.S. The value is in the range from $6\nmillion to $8 million. He has acquired many properties (AE B). He buys the properties for\ninvestment purposes. He remodels them and then rents them. He has approximately 50\nunits. He estimates the gross income from the real estate is about $250,000 a year. His\nconsulting firm is ten years old and has two principal offices. His net profit in 2007 was\nclose to a million dollars (Tr. 92).\nApplicant\u2019s academic advisor for his PhD testified at the hearing that Applicant\nhas worked hard on a number of state and county projects over the past years. Applicant\nadvanced in his field and is reliable and very trustworthy, according to this professor who\nhas known him for 24 years. He knows that Applicant has been involved with confidential\ninformation and has never had any problems with handling security matters (Tr. 27-34). \nApplicant is described by his former colleagues as possessing a high degree of\nresponsibility. He is objective in situations and evaluates the multiple facets of any issue.\nHe is committed to his profession and his business. He conducts himself with\nprofessionalism. He operates his business with honesty, decency and humanity (AE D).\nApplicant\u2019s judgment, knowledge, integrity and credibility is highly valued by his peers in\nthe private sector as well as the government sector. He is an expert in the field of\ninformation technology. A fellow researcher and businessman who has known him since\nhis graduate school days commends Applicant for his reliability and hard work in the field\nof research and development for the environment in the U.S. (AE D). Applicant is highly\nrecommended for a security clearance from his government clients and professional\npeers. No one questioned his loyalty to the U.S. \nApplicant was candid and straightforward at the hearing. He expressed disdain for\nhis home country and has no desire to have any connection with it. He does not consider\nhimself a citizen of Lebanon. In fact, he stated it is an insult for him to be considered a\ndual citizen. He is a U.S. citizen and states his roots are now in the U.S. He explained it\nwas a very serious consideration for him to become a U.S. citizen (Tr. 98). His children\nare U.S. citizens and they are his closest family (Tr. 99). When he learned about the\nprocedures for renunciation of his Lebanese citizenship, he contacted an attorney and\nlearned more about the process (Tr. 101). There are many steps and hurdles to obtain\nthe necessary documentation to satisfy the Lebanese government\nApplicant credibly testified that he has no plans to return to Lebanon. He has\nnever voted in Lebanese elections, joined any political party, or worked for the Lebanese\ngovernment. To his knowledge no one in his family has been contacted by any\ngovernment agents or terrorist groups (Tr. 95). \nApplicant explained that it is his personal responsibility to safeguard classified\ninformation and if there was any threat to national security based on pressure to him or\nhis family, he would take appropriate measures to contact his assigned agent. He\ndescribed a situation in France where he was approached by two strangers and asked to\nconvert some Swiss money into dollars. He believed it was a scam to obtain money. He\nreported it to his security agent immediately. He then called the U.S. Embassy in France.\n\n5\nHe spoke to a security investigator and was thanked for bringing this incident to their\nattention.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s\ngovernment is a parliamentary democracy. Lebanon and the United States have a long-\nstanding friendly relationship. It has been the policy of the United States to help Lebanon\npreserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity.\nLebanon is 95% ethnic Arab. Its population is comprised of various Muslim sects,\nChristian groups, and Druze. The three largest population groups are Shi\u2019a and Sunni\nMuslims and Maronite Christians. Lebanon became the situs of several terrorist\norganizations over the past 30 years that have engaged in armed conflict with Israel and\nWestern countries. The Lebanese government recognizes those organizations as\nlegitimate resistance groups. Lebanon exempts \u201clegal resistance\u201d groups from money\nlaundering and terrorism financing laws. The Lebanese government recognizes\nHezbollah, a terrorist group, as \u201ca legitimate resistance group.\u201d Hezbollah derives its\npower and influence from Lebanon\u2019s Shi\u2019a community, which makes up about one-third\nof Lebanon\u2019s population. Hezbollah maintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in the\ncountry and has elected deputies in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. It also operates a\ncomprehensive system of health and education services in several parts of the country.\nEven though Syria withdrew its military forces from Lebanon in April 2006, it\nmaintains a covert intelligence presence in Lebanon and offers support for and smuggles\narms to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups operating in Lebanon. The Lebanese\ngovernment\u2019s inability to exercise authoritative control in the Hezbollah-dominated south\nof Lebanon and inside Palestinian-controlled refugee camps enables terrorists to operate\nfreely in Lebanon. Hezbollah\u2019s continued attacks on Israel continue to create instability in\nthe region.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\n\n6\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\n7\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Finally, a security concern\nmay be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d). \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S. and lives with him.\nHis sister and her husband live in Lebanon and are citizens of Lebanon and France. His\npartner has lived with him since 2003 and has relatives in Lebanon. Applicant sees his\nsister when she visits the U.S. and speaks to her on the phone when she calls her\nmother. His other sister was born in Lebanon but has not lived there for over ten years.\nShe lives in Cameroon. These relationships are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. The government must establish that these family relationships create\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\nor would create a potential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect sensitive\ninformation and his desire to help his family members.\nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of Lebanon\nand other aspects of life in Lebanon such as crime and terrorism. See ISCR Case No.\n07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). Applicant\u2019s mother lives with him in the U.S. and is a\nU.S. citizen. She receives a social security check from the government of Lebanon. One\nsister lives in Lebanon with her husband. He sees his sister when she visits the U.S. He\nsometimes talks to her on the phone when she calls their mother. P is a permanent\nresident in the U.S. but was born in Lebanon and has his family in Lebanon. Applicant\nhas met P\u2019s family on one or two occasions in the U.S. or France. This contact creates a\nrisk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility\nthat Lebanese agents or terrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about\nthe U.S. His connection to his sister in Lebanon and P also creates a potential conflict of\ninterest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about\nhis desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified information.\n\n8\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the\nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to\nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8\u00a9 \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing showed his willingness to sever ties with Lebanon.\nHe has no plan to visit the country. He has no Lebanese passport. He is renouncing his\nLebanese citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for 24 years. He has substantial personal,\nprofessional and financial ties to the U.S. His sister who lives in Lebanon is planning to\nretire to the U.S. His partner of recent years has relatives in Lebanon but Applicant has\nno ties with them. Applicant has substantial investments in the U.S. He desires to\n\n9\ncontinue his work with county and government projects. His two children live in the U.S.\nHe is closest to them. As such, his testimony supported this mitigating condition, which\nmitigates all disqualifying conditions.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated,\nprofessional. He has lived in the U.S. for 24 years. He became a naturalized citizen 17\nyears ago. He received his master\u2019s and PhD in the U.S. He has consulted on many\nstate government projects. He has substantial personal and professional ties with the\nU.S. He has substantial financial interests in the U.S. He has been involved with\nproprietary information. He has his own business and has established strong\nprofessional ties. He is recommended highly by professional peers and clients, an\nindication of their trust in him. He clearly has established strong connections to the U.S.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives with him in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. His father is\ndeceased. He will inherit property in Lebanon when his mother dies but he is not\ninterested in keeping the property. The value of the property is minuscule compared to\nApplicant\u2019s multi-million dollar financial resources in the U.S.\nHis sister who lives in Lebanon has three children who are permanent residents of\nthe U.S. Applicant sees his sister when she visits the U.S. He does not visit her in\nLebanon. She plans to retire to the U.S. with her husband. She is not involved with the\ngovernment or military in Lebanon. Her children are living in the U.S. and are citizens. \n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s partner P is a permanent resident in the U.S. P does not travel to\nLebanon. P provides financial help to his family living in Lebanon. Applicant has only\ncasual and infrequent contact with P\u2019s family in Lebanon. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B\nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude\nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e;\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant has a history of financial problems as follows: (1) he pleaded guilty in 1996 in state court to a charge of willful failure to file and/or pay withholding tax, and he was sentenced to two years of probation; (2) his software company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996, and the case was terminated in 1997; (3) he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1997, and he received a discharge in 2002; and (4) he owes a large IRS debt. In his Answer, he admitted the allegations with explanations. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant made a false statement about his employment with a government agency during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. He denied this allegation with an explanation. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 59-year-old senior software engineer for a company engaged in defense contracting (Exhibits 1 and B). His educational background includes a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He has worked in this job from October 1996 to present. He has held a security clearance in the past, and he understands that his current application is for a top-secret security clearance. In October 1997, Applicant completed a security-clearance application for his employment with his current employer (Exhibit D). In doing so, he disclosed his overlapping or dual employment with the government agency and his self-employment during the 1989\u2013",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 16, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nApril 15, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 23, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on March 12, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 20, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant has a history of financial problems\nas follows: (1) he pleaded guilty in 1996 in state court to a charge of willful failure to file\nand/or pay withholding tax, and he was sentenced to two years of probation; (2) his\nsoftware company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996, and the case was terminated\nin 1997; (3) he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1997, and he received a discharge in\n2002; and (4) he owes a large IRS debt. In his Answer, he admitted the allegations with\nexplanations. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant made a false statement\nabout his employment with a government agency during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy\ncase. He denied this allegation with an explanation. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 59-year-old senior software engineer for a company engaged in\ndefense contracting (Exhibits 1 and B). His educational background includes a master\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering. He has worked in this job from October 1996 to\npresent. He has held a security clearance in the past, and he understands that his\ncurrent application is for a top-secret security clearance.  \nIn October 1997, Applicant completed a security-clearance application for his\nemployment with his current employer (Exhibit D). In doing so, he disclosed his\noverlapping or dual employment with the government agency and his self-employment\nduring the 1989\u20131996 period. He disclosed his guilty plea to the tax offense. And he\ndisclosed several financial problems (bankruptcy, tax liens, etc.). He completed his\ncurrent security-clearance application in November 2006 (Exhibit 1). In doing so, he\ndisclosed a federal tax lien, which he described as a 100% penalty that the IRS was not\nactively pursuing. He also stated that he had saved and invested sufficiently to pay off\nthe debt and intended to do so in the near future. \nHis relevant employment history is set forth in his Answer and Exhibits 1 and D.\nHe worked as an engineer for a federal governmental agency from March 1989 to\nMarch 1995. While working for the government, he was also self-employed running his\n\n3\nsoftware company until it went out of business. Since October 1996, he has worked in\nhis current job. Concerning the self-employment, in about 1986 he started work to\ndevelop computer installation software. In 1989, he incorporated and ran the company\nout of his house, assisted by his wife. The company grew, and in 1990 he moved it into\na commercial office building and had as many as 12 full-time employees. In March\n1995, he left his government job to work in the company. \nThe company encountered problems that resulted in negative cash flow (Exhibit\n2). The result was an inability to service the company\u2019s debt. In turn, Applicant used\npersonal guarantees of loans and personal credit cards to keep the company afloat. His\nefforts were unsuccessful, and he ended up in state criminal court and federal\nbankruptcy court. \nIn June 1996, Applicant was charged with willful failure to file and/or pay\nwithholding tax for his company (Exhibit 7). Applicant pleaded guilty in state court and\nwas sentenced to a $10 fine or fee, 30 days in jail (suspended), and probation for two\nyears. He served the probation without a violation.  \nIn November 1996 (a month after he started his current job), the company\nsought relief in bankruptcy court under Chapter 11, which provides for reorganization of\nbusiness debt (Exhibit 4). In April 1997, a plan of reorganization was submitted and it\nincluded a disclosure statement that Applicant signed (Exhibit 6). Under the subheading\nfor company history, the disclosure statement described Applicant\u2019s employment\nhistory, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cIn 1989, [Applicant] went to work for [the\ngovernment agency], leaving in 1990 to form the [company].\u201d The statement is factually\nincorrect, because he did not leave his government job until March 1995. Although\nApplicant signed the disclosure statement, he did not prepare it and he did not intend to\ndeceive or misrepresent his employment history in the bankruptcy case (Tr. 49\u201357). \nIn April 1997, Applicant sought relief in bankruptcy court under Chapter 13, which\nprovides an individual debtor an opportunity to repay creditors under a court-approved\nplan (Exhibits 5 and 6). The Chapter 13 case was a companion case with the Chapter\n11 case (Exhibit 4). The Chapter 13 paperwork described Applicant as an employee\nwith a defense contractor for the last seven months (and is still his employer today)\n(Exhibits 5 and 6\u2013Schedule I). In June 1997, the bankruptcy court confirmed the\nChapter 13 repayment plan with $750 monthly payments for 60 months (Exhibit 5). \nA few months later in August 1997, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Chapter\n11 reorganization plan (Exhibit 4). It appears that the debts followed Applicant to the\nChapter 13 plan (See Exhibits 2, 4, and 5\u2013Exhibit A to confirmation order). Thereafter,\nApplicant made the required $750 monthly payments while working for his current\nemployer, and upon completion of the Chapter 13 plan he received a discharge in\nbankruptcy in July 2002. \nThe business failure also resulted in debts to state and federal tax authorities.\nThose debts are now resolved. His plan to pay off the IRS debt was to withdraw the\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n4\nnecessary funds from retirement accounts (Answer). But that did not happen, and\nApplicant presented documentary evidence and credible testimony that the IRS debt\nwas otherwise resolved (Exhibits A and C, Tr. 46-49, 52, 63\u201364). In particular, the IRS,\nby letter, informed Applicant that his federal income taxes are paid in full as of March 4,\n2008 (Exhibit A). In summary, it appears the federal tax lien(s) expired or self-released\n(or both), the IRS did not re-file, and the IRS did not seek collection through other\nmeans. Indeed, a federal tax lien is not reported in a March 2008 credit report; also, the\nsame report shows the state tax liens were paid and released (Exhibit C\u2013Transunion\ncredit report). \nApplicant earns an annual salary of $82,000, and his wife earns about $42,000\nworking as an office manager. He now has a good credit history, as reflected in the\nMarch 2008 credit reports (Exhibit C). He has no derogatory, unsatisfactory, delinquent,\nor past-due accounts; he has a credit score of 794 on a scale of 330\u2013830, which means\nthat 99% of the U.S. credit active population has a lower score (Exhibit C\u2013Experian\ncredit report). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n DC 4 is \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income\n18\ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches\nof trust.\u201d \n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n19\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history raises security concerns because it indicates inability to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n16\n17\nGuideline F. In addition, his 1996 guilty plea to a state tax offense also raises a\nconcern.  Taken together, these circumstances call into question Applicant\u2019s judgment,\n18\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions may mitigate security concerns,\nand those conditions are as follows:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.19\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, MC 1 through MC 4 apply in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor; MC 5 and MC 6 do not. The applicable MC are discussed below. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions under Guideline E).  \n7\nMC 1 applies because the underlying behavior that led to the financial problems\ntook place years ago when the business failed. Those circumstances are unlikely to\nrepeat because Applicant is no longer operating the same or a similar business and has\nno plans to do so again. It does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment because he has addressed and resolved the financial problems. \nMC 2 applies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from a failed\nbusiness, which was largely beyond his control. He acted as a reasonable\nbusinessperson should under the circumstances by seeking relief in bankruptcy court,\nfirst in Chapter 11 proceedings and then in Chapter 13 proceedings. And he satisfied\nthe Chapter 13 repayment plan by paying $45,000 per the five-year plan. \nMC 3 applies because there are clear indications that the problems are resolved\nand under control. He  successfully completed the Chapter 13 repayment plan and paid\nhis state tax debt. The IRS debt has been resolved. His current financial condition is\nstable and under control as evidenced by the six-figure household income and a vastly\nimproved credit history.\nMC 4 applies because he took positive steps to resolve his financial problems.\nHe successfully completed the Chapter 13 repayment plan and paid off his state tax\ndebt. He was prepared and willing to pay off the IRS debt and took action to do so only\nto discover it was resolved. And there is no indication that he calculated or manipulated\nto obtain this result. Taken together, these circumstances fall within the meaning of a\ngood-faith effort. \nTo sum up, Applicant experienced serious financial problems directly related to\nhis small business. When it failed, he took a job with a defense contractor and used that\nincome to make his Chapter 13 payments and meet his other financial obligations. And\nhe resolved his tax debts. All of these matters are substantial evidence in mitigation. In\naddition, the likelihood that similar financial problems will recur is remote. Accordingly,\nfor all these reasons, Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n20\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n21\n8\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.21\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if it is the result of an honest\nmistake, the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood\nthe question, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be reported. \nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s employment history (the dates of\nemployment) with a government agency as recited in a disclosure statement for the\nChapter 11 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant denied an intent to deceive or\nmisrepresent his employment history in the document. His denial and explanation are\ncredible. The disclosure statement is the type of legal document typically prepared by a\nbankruptcy attorney, paralegal, or clerk or all three. The incorrect information resulted\nfrom an oversight by Applicant when he reviewed and signed the disclosure statement.\nHe should have caught the error, but it was nothing more than an honest mistake.\nExperience in the ways of the world and the practice of law suggest that he was not the\nfirst client (nor will he be the last) to have to account for a mistake attributable to his\nlawyer. To sum up, Applicant refuted the falsification allegation. In light of this failure of\nproof, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant \n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 29, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another judge on January 12, 2011, \nand reassigned to me on March 2, 2011.

The request was denied and the case was \nscheduled for May 17, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 28, 2011. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney submitted a motion for reconsideration of the hearing date.1 \nDepartment Counsel opposed the delay.2 I denied the motion.3 I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on May 17, 2011. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted into evidence. The Government \nrequested administrative notice be taken of HE IV through XV. I granted the request. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He offered Exhibits (AE) A through R, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant requested administrative notice be \ntaken of HE XVI. I granted the request over the objection of the Government.4 DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 24, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has been married to his present wife since 2005. \nHe was married three previous times. His wife, who is 56 years old, was married twice \nbefore. Applicant has a 29-year-old son. His wife had two daughters, both are \ndeceased. He has worked for different government contractors since about 2003. He \nhas held a secret security clearance since 1978. Applicant has an associate\u2019s degree \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree. He was commissioned in the Army Reserve and is eligible to \nretire as a major (O-4). He held jobs from 1996 to 2001, with different state and federal \ngovernment agencies.5  \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was recalled to active duty and was stationed in South Korea. \nHe was released from active duty in early 2003, and was offered and accepted a job \nwith a federal contractor in South Korea.

While living in Russia, she answered a \nnewspaper advertisement soliciting people to work in a factory in South Korea. \nApplicant did not know what the financial arrangements were for her employment. She \ntook the job and moved to South Korea. She was there for a short while and before she \nstarted work, she decided that she did not want the job. Applicant was told by her that \nshortly before she was to return to Russia, she was approached on the street by a man \nthat wanted her to appear in a television program on South Korean television. Applicant \ndid not know what financial arrangements were made. He stated that the director \nreimbursed the factory and took over her work contract. He did not know if she received \nsome type of compensation or travel stipend when she accepted the factory job. He did \nnot know what transpired as far as her agreement with the television person and what \ntook place for her to remain in the country legally. She apparently was on a television \nshow for two years and then on a different show for another year. Her contract was not \nrenewed, and she returned to Russia in 2004.7  \n \n \nAfter meeting in 2003 in South Korea, Applicant and his wife dated approximately \na year. He did not report his contact with her to his security officer, because he did not \nbelieve he was required to because he was not cohabitating with her. In 2004, he \ntraveled to Russia to visit her. He properly advised his security manager of the trip. \nWhile in Russia, he stayed with his future wife\u2019s niece and husband at their residence. \nHe stayed a week. He does not know anything about his wife\u2019s ex-husbands. He \nunderstood through his wife that they are deceased.8  \n \n \nIn March or April 2005, Applicant traveled to Russia to ask his wife to marry him. \nHe properly advised his security manager of the trip and his intentions. He stayed at his \nwife\u2019s apartment. He was there a week.  \n \n \nIn May or June 2005, he traveled to Russia and married his wife in a civil \nceremony. They received a Russian marriage certificate. Her relatives attended the \nwedding. After they wed, he returned to South Korea, and she remained in Russia until \nhe was able to secure the appropriate documents for her to move to South Korea. He \nreturned to Russia with the appropriate documents for her to submit to the consulate in \nRussia. She did not return to South Korea with Applicant at this time. After all the \nrequirements were met, she moved to South Korea on July 24, 2005. Applicant applied \nfor her to have access to the military base as his spouse, and his request was granted.9 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia in 2006 with his wife, so she could visit her family \nand he could plan a motorcycle trip for a later date in Russia with others. They returned \nto Russia in May or June 2006, for the motorcycle trip. They both took the trip, along \n \n7 Tr. 60-63, 112, 119-124, 152-155; 176-178. \n \n8 Tr. 89-91, 112-115, 173. \n \n9 Tr. 57, 63-68, 92-95. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwith eight other people. It was a five-day trip. Applicant obtained approval from his \nsecurity manager prior to taking the trip.10  \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant took another motorcycle trip in Russia. Five people \naccompanied him, along with his wife. He obtained approval from his security manager \nprior to taking the trip. While in Russia he and his wife stayed at her apartment.11 \n \n \nIn 2008, as part of his job, Applicant traveled to Russia to participate in a \nplanning session for military exercises between Russia and the United States. There \nwere approximately 10 to 12 U.S. military and civilian personnel who were on the trip. \nApplicant\u2019s wife did not accompany him. He met with Russian personnel on a daily \nbasis. They all worked in similar areas of expertise.12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s half-sister and her husband are citizens and residents of \nRussia. She and her half-sister have the same mother. Applicant\u2019s wife stays in contact \nwith her by telephone, and when she is in Russia they visit each other. She is 61 years \nold and a medical doctor. Applicant had contact with her when he visited Russia in \n2004, at his wedding in 2005, and in 2007, when he was on his motorcycle trip. \nApplicant does not speak Russian and his wife\u2019s relatives do not speak English, so they \ndid not communicate verbally. The half-sister\u2019s husband is about 66 or 67 and is retired. \nHe was a supervisor at a collective farm. Applicant met him when he was in Russia in \n2004, 2005 and 2007. His wife is in contact with her half sister about once or twice a \nmonth by telephone.13  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s half-sister has two daughters. One is about 32 years old and is \na housewife. She is married and has a young child. Her husband served as an officer in \nthe Russian Air Force. Applicant stated he was told by his wife that he no longer serves \nin the Air Force and was released due to a reduction in force. The couple has an \nadopted child who is five years old. Applicant stated the only factual information he \nknows about his wife\u2019s family was told to him by his wife. He met the niece and her \nhusband at his wedding. The husband is now an auto mechanic. Applicant\u2019s only \ncontact with his wife\u2019s niece and husband was in 2005 and 2007. Applicant has not had \nany contact with his wife\u2019s relatives in Russia since 2007. Applicant does not believe his \nwife maintains contact with these relatives be telephone. However, she may see them \nwhen she is in Russia.14  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s other niece is a housewife, and her husband buys farm \nequipment that is in disrepair, refurbishes it, and resells it. They have two sons, ages 18 \n \n10 Tr. 95-98. \n \n11 Tr. 98-100; AE P. \n \n12 Tr. 100-102; AE Q. \n \n13 Tr. 71-76, 127-128. \n \n14 Tr. 76-81, 85, 128-133. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nand 16. The elder son is attending college, and the younger is in high school. Applicant \nhas stayed in their home on two trips to Russia. He has visited with them on all of his \ntrips to Russia, except the last one when he was on official travel. Applicant\u2019s wife \ncommunicates by telephone with this niece about once or twice a month.15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife traveled to Russia in 2010 to renew her Russian passport. She \nhas an active Russian passport. She stayed with her niece for seven weeks and visited \nother family while there. She also visited her family in Russia in 2009 and stayed with \nher family for about six weeks.16  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife attended technical college in Russia and worked as a restaurant \nmanager and in sales. When she travels to Russia she stays with her niece. She has \nvisited the United States one time in 2006 to meet Applicant\u2019s family.17  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife owns an apartment in Russia valued at approximately $100,000. \nShe rents the apartment and receives approximately $300 to $350 in rental income. She \nalso receives about $200 to $235 as a pension from the Russian government. She \nmaintains two bank accounts in Russia where the rental income and pension are \ndeposited. Applicant\u2019s net income is approximately $80,000. His wife does not work. \nShe does not send money to her family in Russia, but will occasionally send gifts for \nChristmas. Applicant does not own property in the United States. He believes he will \ninherit land in the United States after his 74-year-old mother passes away. He has a \nthrift savings retirement account that he estimated was worth about $150,000.18  \n \n \nApplicant stated: \u201cMy wife current[ly] has an approved petition for her to obtain an \nimmigrant visa to move to the United States commonly known as a green card.\u201d19 \nApplicant provided a document from the Department of Justice, U.S. Citizenship & \nImmigration Services: Notice of Approval of Relative Immigration Visa Petition. The \ndocument states:  \n \nYour petition has been approved and is valid for the duration of your \npresent relationship to the beneficiary.  \n \nPlease be advised that approval of the petition confers upon the \nbeneficiary an appropriate classification.

(Emphasis added) \n \nYour petition to classify beneficiary as an immediate relative of a United \nStates citizen has been forwarded to the American Consulate [foreign \nlocation]. This completes all action by the service on the petition.20 \n \nThe petition was filed on July 8, 2009, and the date of the approval of the petition was \nAugust 20, 2009. No other supporting documents were provided. Applicant stated that \nhe intends for his wife to become a permanent resident of the United States, but \nbecause they live outside of the United States, she cannot apply at this time. He stated \nshe obtained a tourist visa about two months ago. He did not provide the supporting \ndocuments. He tentatively plans on retiring in about seven years. He does not expect to \nreturn to Russia, unless he is sent on official duty.21  \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of performance evaluations showing outstanding or \nexceeding standards ratings.22 I have considered all of the evidence submitted by \nApplicant. Character letters reflect that Applicant is loyal, professional, and a trusted \nfriend. He is dedicated to his country and protecting it. He has not been observed or \nexhibited behavior that would question his loyalty, honest, and integrity.23  \n \nThe Russian Federation24 \n \nThe Russian Federation is composed of 21 republics. The government consists \nof a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature and a weak judiciary. It is \na vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million people. It achieved \nindependence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. It is a \nnuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, and economically. \n \nThe United States and Russia share certain common strategic interests. Of \nmutual interest to the United States and Russia are counterterrorism and the reduction \nof strategic arsenals. Russia and the United States share a common interest in \ncontrolling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program was launched in 1992 to \nprovide for the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet \nUnion. The CTR program was renewed in 2006 for seven years, until 2013. \n \n20 AE F. \n \n21 Tr. 68-71, 105-107, 186-187. \n \n22 AE G, H, I, J. \n \n23 AE L, M. N. O, P, R.  \n \n24 HE IV-XVI. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nU.S.-Russian relations have often been strained. Tensions between the United \nStates and Russia increased in August 2008, when Russia sent its army across an \ninternationally recognized boundary in an attempt to change by force the borders of \nGeorgia, a country with a democratically-elected government. Russia\u2019s assault on \nGeorgia followed other troubling signs: threats against Poland, including the threat of \nnuclear attack; suspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and those deemed \n\u201cundesirable,\u201d including the President of Ukraine; the apparent use of energy resources \nto apply political pressure against Ukraine, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic; and the \ncreation in Russia\u2019s state-controlled media of an \u201cenemy image\u201d of the United States. \n \n \nThe Russian Federation\u2019s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on \ncollection of information from the United States. Russia has targeted U.S. technologies \nand has sought to obtain protected information from them through industrial espionage. \nRussian espionage specializes in military technology and gas and oil industry expertise. \nAs of 2005, Russia and China were the two most aggressive collectors of sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and accounted for the majority of such targeting. Russia is a \nleading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. \n \nIn 2010, Russia continued to increase their intelligence gathering efforts and \nintelligence capabilities directed against the United States interests worldwide through \nespionage, technology acquisition, and covert actions. Also in 2010, the United States \nDepartment of Justice announced arrests of ten alleged secret agents for carrying out \nlong-term, deep-covered assignments on behalf of Russia.  \n \nThe current administration has stressed a new working relationship with Russia \nand it continues to work on a wide range of issues, including cooperation with respect to \nAfghanistan and on other international issues. There has been a long tradition of trade \nand commerce between the two countries.  \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the vicinity \nof Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the terrorists. Acts \nof terrorism include taking hostages and bombings.  \n \nRussia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, \nbut human rights abuses continue. Both Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel \nforces \nact \nwith \nimpunity \nwhile \nengaging \nin \ntorture, \nsummary \nexecutions, \ndisappearances, and arbitrary detentions. There are reports of attacks on and killings of \njournalists, physical abuse by law enforcement officers, extremely harsh and at times \nlife-threatening prison conditions and arbitrary detention and politically motivated \nimprisonments. Additional problems include corruption, media suppression, and \nwidespread corruption throughout the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and \nlaw enforcement.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State reports allegations that Russian government \nofficials and others conduct warrantless searches of residences and other premises and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nelectronic surveillance without judicial permission. This surveillance includes Ministry of \nInternal Affairs and Federal Security Office monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.  \nAdditionally, Russian law enforcement agencies have legal access to the personal \ninformation of users of telephone and cell phone services.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government or owning \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nproperty in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country \nas well as each individual family tie must be considered.25  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d26 \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d27 Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, \nthe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, or the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the \nnature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist \nactivity in the country at issue.28 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Russia. His wife\u2019s half sister, brother-in-law, two \nnieces and their husbands, and their three children, are citizens and residents of \nRussia. His wife owns an apartment in Russia valued at approximately $100,000. She \nmaintains two bank accounts in Russia where rental income is deposited and a pension \nshe receives from the Russian government. Her financial interests in Russia are \nsubstantial. Applicant traveled to Russia in 2004, three times in 2005, twice in 2006, \nonce in 2007, and in 2008 he traveled on official business. These facts potentially \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion, and also create a potential conflict of interest. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(d) apply.  \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n \n25 ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003. \n \n26 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n27 ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n \n28 See generally, ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant lives with his wife and his wife maintains a close relationship with some \nof her relatives in Russia. She stays with them when she visits. Her recent visits have \nbeen six to seven weeks long. The nature of his relationship with his wife and her \nrelationship with her relatives is more than casual and is not infrequent. Applicant has \nstayed with his wife\u2019s relatives when he visited Russia on personal travel. I find AG \u00b6 \n8(c) does not apply because his relationship with his wife and her relatives is more than \ncasual. His wife\u2019s relationship with her relatives is more than casual and is not \ninfrequent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Russian citizen. Although Russia and the United States \nmaintain ties and cooperate on an international scale, through commerce and other \ncooperative agreements, Russia is an aggressive collector of sensitive and protected \nU.S. technology and accounted for the majority of such targeting among nations. Russia \nis a leading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. In addition, as Applicant stated, he \nsometimes works cooperatively with Russia on exercises and traveled there in the past \nas part of his official duties. This puts him in a vulnerable position because he has \nworked directly with the country where his wife is a citizen, has relatives that live there, \nthe country is known to be an aggressive collection of sensitive information, has a \nhistory of committing espionage against the United States, and commits human rights \nviolations. Even if Applicant did not work directly with Russia on occasion, the same \nfactors are an issue. I cannot find that it is unlikely under the circumstances, that \nApplicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between his wife and her \nrelatives, and the interests of the United States. For the same reasons, I find there is a \nconflict of interest because of Applicant\u2019s obligation and commitment to his wife, and her \nobligation and commitment to her relatives in Russia, which is not minimal. She visits \nthem and stays in contact with them. Given the significance of the spousal bond, I \ncannot find that Applicant would resolve a conflict of interest against his wife and for the \nUnited States. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) do not apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \neligible to receive a military pension. He has worked for the federal government and for \nfederal contractors for many years and has received good performance evaluations and \ncharacter references. Applicant\u2019s wife is a Russian citizen. She resides with Applicant in \na different foreign country. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s ties to Russia are through her citizenship, \nher family that resides there, and her substantial assets located there. Russia is one of \nthe most active collectors of sensitive technology from the United States; it continues to \ncommit espionage against the United States embedding spies into local communities; it \nhas questionable human rights practices; and there is widespread corruption throughout \nits branches of government and law enforcement. These facts create a heightened risk \nto foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. Applicant \nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion. I have considered all of these factors. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a program manager with the same company since September 1982. Applicant is a naturalized United States citizen, having been naturalized in 1962. Applicant\u2019s parents are United States citizens. His father and mother were born in the United States and in Germany, respectively. In 2000, Applicant married a citizen of Brazil who lives in the United States. She has applied for United States citizenship. His step-daughter is 11-years-old, is a permanent resident of the United States, and a citizen of Brazil. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are residents and citizens of Brazil. The father is retired from a city government 1 and the mother works for a store. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws is ill defined, but it is noted he speaks to them three or four times a year by telephone. There is scant evidence as to the contact and relationship between his wife and her parents. Between 2002 and 2003, Applicant spent approximately $180,000 in funds from his 401(k) retirement plan to buy two properties in Brazil. The first is a home for the use of his parents.

On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and, on June 18, 2008, answered\nthe SOR allegations. Applicant admitted four of the six financial allegations. He also\nadmitted two of the three foreign influence allegations. The third allegation was denied\nto the extent that one of the two individuals cited in the SOR was misidentified; in his\ndenial, Applicant corrected the identity of the relative. Applicant requested a decision be\nmade without a hearing. On July 12, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n Although no evidence is offered to substantiate this claim, Applicant states that his wife is pursuing U.S.\n1\ncitizenship. \n2\nRelevant Material (FORM) setting forth the government\u2019s case based on the SOR.\nApplicant received the FORM on July 31, 2008. He declined to timely submit any\nopposition to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2008, for\nadministrative determination. Based upon a review of the limited case file and exhibits\npresented, Applicant failed to carry his burden and mitigate security concerns.\nClearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a\nprogram manager with the same company since September 1982. Applicant is a\nnaturalized United States citizen, having been naturalized in 1962. Applicant\u2019s parents\nare United States citizens. His father and mother were born in the United States and in\nGermany, respectively.\nIn 2000, Applicant married a citizen of Brazil who lives in the United States. She\nhas applied for United States citizenship. His step-daughter is 11-years-old, is a\npermanent resident of the United States, and a citizen of Brazil. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\nparents are residents and citizens of Brazil.  The father is retired from a city government\n1\nand the mother works for a store. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws is ill defined,\nbut it is noted he speaks to them three or four times a year by telephone. There is scant\nevidence as to the contact and relationship between his wife and her parents.\nBetween 2002 and 2003, Applicant spent approximately $180,000 in funds from\nhis 401(k) retirement plan to buy two properties in Brazil. The first is a home for the use\nof his parents. The second is a condominium which he expects to use upon retirement\nin approximately six years. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s April 2006 credit bureau report and various credit bureau\nreports from 2008, there are six delinquent accounts at issue. They are referenced as\nsix allegations under paragraph one of the SOR. First, there is a credit account charged\noff in the approximate amount of $3,747 (SOR Allegation 1.a). Applicant alleges he\ntried to work out a payment plan on this balance, but that the terms offered were too\nhigh. No evidence of such negotiations was introduced. Second, there is an account\ncharged off in the approximate amount of $2,163. Applicant claims that he has no\nknowledge of this account and declined to indicate whether he has ever disputed its\ninclusion on his credit report (SOR Allegation 1.b). Third, there is an account charged\noff by a telecommunications company in the approximate amount of $773 (SOR\nAllegation 1.c). Applicant claims the bill was for overseas calls made on his cell phone\nnumber without his knowledge, that he advised his carrier of this belief, but that no\ncorrective action has been taken. No evidence of formal dispute of this account was\nintroduced. Fourth, there is a past due amount owed on a mortgage totaling $286,000,\nwhich Applicant states is now current (SR Allegation 1.d). No evidence, however, was\nintroduced showing its current status.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n2\n3\nThe fifth and sixth debts cited concern taxes. For the fifth obligation, there is an\nindebtedness to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2002 and 2003 in the\napproximate amount of $39,934.69 (SOR Allegation 1.e). Applicant writes that he is in a\nrepayment plan to pay $210 every two weeks. In his response to the SOR, he provided\na pay stub indicating $210 is deducted for payment on a \u201cTAX LEVY.\u201d Sixth, there is a\nstate franchise tax for tax years 2003 and 2004 in the approximate amount of\n$6,037.97 owed (SOR Allegations 1.f). Applicant writes he is in a repayment plan to pay\nback this arrearage through $130 payments every two weeks. In his response to the\nSOR, he offered a pay stub showing $130 is deducted for \u201cGARNISH PERCE.\u201d If these\nrepayments were in place as depicted, Applicant\u2019s combined debt on the two tax\naccounts would be under $35,000.\nApplicant did not submit any additional materials or argument in response to the\nSOR. Additionally, he requested a decision based on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. Under to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n2\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n3\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n4\n Id.\n5\n Id.\n6\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n7\n4\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n3\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n4\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n5\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n6\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n7\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following guidelines\nfrom AG \u00b6 6 and \u00b6 18  to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this\ncase:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or an\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\n\n5\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence. The Concern: The concern under\nthis adjudicative guideline is that foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledges he has a domestic mortgage\nfor approximately $286,000 and admits the allegation that it was past due as of about\nMay 2008. He further admits he is about $3,800 past due on a credit account and has\ntaxes owed in the approximate amount of at least $35,000. Such facts are sufficient to\ndetermine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts\u201d) apply. With such conditions established, the burden shifts to Appellant\nto overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nBecause Applicant offered so few facts, and since the few facts argued were\nlargely uncorroborated with documentary evidence, there is scant basis upon which to\nraise Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). For\nsimilar reasons, AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply.\nApplicant failed to link \u201cTAX LEVY\u201d and \u201cGARNISH - - - - - -\u201d with the tax liabilities\nalleged in the SOR. Assuming they are, in fact, these two tax accounts, he also\nneglected to substantiate how long these payroll deductions have been going on or\ndocument the current balances owed. Had he so linked and documented these two\naccounts, however, he still would have failed to substantiate any other efforts with\nregard to the majority of other accounts alleged. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) does\nnot apply. For the same reason, and in the absence of evidence he has received\nrequisite financial counseling, AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving\n\n ISCR Case No, 3-26976 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004).\n8\n ISCR Case No. 98-0507 at 8 (App. Bd. May 17, 1999).\n9\n6\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply. This is particularly true in the absence of\nevidence as to his current finances and a demonstration of improved circumstances. In\nsum, Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to mitigate security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(d).\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s wife and step-daughter are permanent residents of the\nUnited States, they are still citizens of Brazil. Moreover, while nothing is offered with\nregard to Applicant\u2019s in-laws\u2019 backgrounds, occupations, or relationships with their\ndaughter, it is established that they were born in Brazil and currently reside in that\ncountry. Similarly, little is offered with regard to Applicant\u2019s own parents, except that he\nhas provided them with a house of indeterminate description in Brazil. Finally,\nApplicant\u2019s Brazilian real estate ownership extends beyond his parents\u2019 home to some\ntype of condominium for his retirement. Such facts give rise to Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG AG \u00b6 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d), AG \u00b6\n7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status,\nif that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d), and AG \u00b6 7(e) (\u201csubstantial business, financial, or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-influenced business,\nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence\u201d) apply.\nRegarding the term \u201cheightened risk,\u201d family ties and financial interests alone are\nnot enough to establish a concern under the guideline. Heightened risk must also be\npresent. Heightened risk, however, does not necessarily require the foreign country at\nissue to be hostile. The Appeal Board has recognized that not all countries that might\nseek classified information do so in order to harm the United States.  As well, even in\n8\nthe absence of coercions being brought to bear on family members in a foreign country,\nthe security significance of family ties cannot be evaluated in a simplistic manner.9\nHere, the heightened risk is Applicant\u2019s financial stake in Brazil, having shifted a\nsignificant amount of money from his retirement fund to Brazil in order to house family\nmembers, and the absence of facts concerning his family members\u2019 situations and\ncircumstances with foreign connections.\nWith disqualifying conditions thus raised, Applicant has the opportunity to\nmitigate security concerns. Here, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(a)\nrequires that circumstances make it unlikely that an Applicant will be required to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, groups, organizations, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant, however, introduced insufficient evidence to\n\n7\nestablish this mitigating condition. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence upon which to\njudge whether AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest\u201d) or AG \u00b6 8(c) (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation\u201d) applies. Although AG \u00b6 8(e) applies if the value or routine\nnature of the foreign interest (ie. business or property) makes it unlikely to result in\nconflict, there is insufficient evidence this mitigating condition applies. \nIn conclusion, Applicant\u2019s spouse and step-daughter are citizens of Brazil. His\nspouse\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Brazil. He has substantially invested in\nBrazilian property. Applicant did not meet his burden of proving any mitigating\ncondition(s) apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Here, little is known about the Applicant aside from the fact that he\nis a mature man with considerable work experience. This is largely because he did not\nprovide documentation to support the mitigation of security concerns. The limited\ninformation he did provide gives little insight into his extended family, their relationship\nwith Brazil, his foreign real estate, any plan to resolve all his delinquent debts, or his\ncurrent finances. As it now stands, questions remain regarding foreign influence and\nfinancial considerations. I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with national security\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Virginia M. Gomez, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn November 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nG, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 5, 2007, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on January 3, 2008. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on January 14, 2008, responded \nthrough counsel on February 12, 2008, and submitted Exhibits (Ex.) A through N. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s response. I received the case \nassignment on March 4, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He is a college \ngraduate. He has been with his current employer since 1995, and his previous company \nfrom 1988 to 1995. Applicant has worked on the same program and has held a security \nclearance for more than 20 years. He has never been married and has no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was about 17 years old. He stated \nthat he would normally drink between about two to four beers about twice a month. In \nhis response to the FORM, Applicant described his drinking in college as primarily beer, \nand primarily on the weekends. He stated he generally only drank two beers at a time \nbut sometimes would drink as many as four.2 In a handwritten statement provided on \nMarch 13, 1987, Applicant described his drinking while in college somewhat differently: \n \nRegarding my alcohol usage. While I was a student in the last year of \ncollege I had anxieties about graduating and my future which led to me \ndrinking approximately three nights a week between the period of DEC 85 \nand JAN 86. I would drink approximately 4 drinks a night, rum and coke at \nlocal bars in the [-----] area. Drinking made me feel not [illegible] and I \nwould get verbal at times. I always felt bad the next morning. I would have \ndrank seven nights a week if I had the money. Upon knowing I was going \nto graduate I curtailed my alcohol drinking because I no longer needed to \ndrink into excess anymore. I feel I do not now have an alcohol drinking \nproblem and I currently drink one plum brandy, four days a week at the \nmost. . .  Regarding my alcohol usage I enjoy taking an alcohol drink in the \nevening to help me relax but I do not get intoxicated nor do I have any \nfuture intent on doing so.3 \n \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests in the 1980s. He was charged with \npublic drunkenness in 1982, when he was 24 years old. He stated that he drank about \ntwo rum and cokes in a bar and felt sick. He went outside to throw up. He was arrested \nwhile he was getting sick. He completed a diversion program after which the charge \n                                                          \n1 Ex. 4, A, M. \n \n2 Ex. 5, A. \n \n3 Ex. 6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas dismissed. His next incident occurred in 1986. Applicant was 28 years old at the \ntime and in his last year of college. He was again arrested and charged with public \ndrunkenness. He pled guilty and was given probation, which he successfully completed. \nIn his response to the FORM, he stated that he had been drinking after the last day of \nclasses and finally finishing school. He stated he \u201cwas arrested when the police found \n[him] arguing with someone outside the dorms on campus.\u201d 4 He described his arrest in \ngreater detail in his 1987 statement: \n \nI was drinking in a bar in [-----] and drank about 4 rum and cokes. I don\u2019t \nremember leaving because I must have had periods of blackouts. I do \nremember walking home and I saw a girl on a balcony of an apartment \nhouse. Upon seeing her I started shouting to her about President Reagan \nbeing a teflon president and how I felt it was illegal for the United States to \nbe involved in Nicaragua. Shortly an [-----] Police unit rolled up and \narrested me [for] being a public nuisance and being drunk in public.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on May 29, 2005, and charged with (1) Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI) and (2) Driving Under the Influence with 0.08% or Higher Blood Alcohol. \nHe pled guilty on August 24, 2005 to the first charge. Judgment was withheld for 36 \nmonths; he was given 36 months of probation; he was ordered to a First Offender \nAlcohol Program; and he was ordered to pay restitution, a fine, and court costs. The \nsecond charge was dismissed. In addition to the First Offender Alcohol Program, \nApplicant was required to attend six Alcoholics Anonymous meetings within three \nmonths. He voluntarily attended 36 meetings. He attended approximately 20 classes \nand completed the First Offender Alcohol Program in October 2005. Applicant, through \nhis criminal attorney, petitioned the court on January 25, 2008 to permit him to withdraw \nhis guilty plea, or that the finding of guilty be set aside and a plea of not guilty be \nentered and the court dismiss his action. The court had not acted on the petition as of \nFebruary 12, 2008, the date Applicant responded to the FORM.6  \n \n \nApplicant was vacationing at a cabin when he was arrested. He began watching \nthe Indianapolis 500 car race by himself. He started drinking alcohol while watching the \ncar race. He estimated that he drank four ten-ounce drinks that contained vodka and \nsoda over about a four hour period. At about 3:30 in the afternoon, he decided to drive \nto a nearby lake and take his dog for a walk. He stated that he felt he was competent to \ndrive. Applicant struck another car. There was damage to the vehicles but no injuries. \nPolice arrived and Applicant was given a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer which \ntested at .27% blood alcohol content (BAC). In his response to the FORM, Applicant \nstated that he never would have driven had he known he was that impaired and he \nclearly underestimated the impact of the amount of alcohol he ingested over the given \n                                                          \n4 Ex. 3, 5, 6, A. \n \n5 Ex 6. \n \n6 Ex. 3, 5, 7, A, I, J. The allegation states the arrest was on May 24, 2005. Court records indicate \nthe violation occurred on May 24, 2005, but the DMV record submitted as Ex. J indicates Applicant was \narrested on May 29, 2005. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ntime frame. In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated the DUI occurred under the \n\u201cunusual circumstance\u201d of mourning for his deceased father and not being able to enjoy \nthe race, a traditional family event. No information was submitted as to when his father \npassed away.7 \n \n \nApplicant described his drinking to a background investigator on August 10, \n2006. A statement was not provided but the interview was summarized in a Report of \nInvestigation (ROI). He was sent Interrogatories containing the ROI and was asked if \nthe ROI accurately reflected the information that he provided to the investigator. He \ncertified on September 21, 2007 that it did. He was provided an opportunity to add \nadditional information regarding the matters discussed during his interview but chose \nnot to add anything. Applicant described his alcohol consumption at that time as three to \nfour times a week and that on two of the four occasions he would drink more than two \ndrinks. He normally drank vodka and soda in a 12-ounce glass with ice, which included \na couple ounces of alcohol. He stated that he usually drank while alone watching \ntelevision. He did not feel he had a problem with alcohol and he intended to drink in \nmoderation and never to drink and drive.8  \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM dated February 8, 2008, Applicant stated that his \ndrinking habits became more moderate during the last year. His drinking was down to \none or two drinks on any particular occasion, once or twice a month. He took \nresponsibility for his DUI and his alcohol-related offenses in the 1980s. He stated: \n \nI now understand that I should only consume alcohol in extreme \nmoderation and never to the point of intoxication, which means I should \nnot drink more than two drinks on any single occasion.9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous letters from supervisors and co-workers who have \nknown him for many years. He is described as a highly competent engineer, who is \ndependable, responsible, reliable, trustworthy, and honest. They are aware of the basis \nof the SOR, but none have ever seen other evidence of an alcohol problem. They \nrecommend him for a security clearance. His most recent performance appraisal was \nexcellent. His security officer verified that Applicant has held a security clearance for \nmany years without a violation.10  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                                          \n7 Ex. 3, 5, A. \n \n8 Ex. 5. \n \n9 Ex. A. \n \n10 Ex. B-H, L. \n \n\n \n5 \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \n\n \n6 \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits and alcohol-related arrests are sufficient to raise the \nabove potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests when he was in his 20\u2019s. His DUI in \n2005 is the only alcohol-related incident in more than 20 years. He has not been \n\n \n7 \n \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser; although his actions clearly \nindicate he has abused alcohol. Applicant acknowledged that his alcohol use caused \nhim legal and professional problems. He attended approximately 20 classes and \ncompleted his First Offender Alcohol Program. He was ordered to attend six Alcoholics \nAnonymous meetings, but he voluntarily attended 36 meetings. He has reduced his \ndrinking to one or two drinks, once or twice a month. AG \u00b6 23(b) is applicable and AG \u00b6 \n23(a) is partially applicable. The remaining mitigating conditions are not applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had two alcohol-related \narrests in the 1980s and a DUI in May 2005. The DUI was his only alcohol-related \nincident in more than 20 years. Other than the obvious consequences directly \nassociated with the DUI, alcohol has not negatively affected his professional career. He \nhas worked on the same program and has held a security clearance for more than 20 \nyears, without a security violation. He is very highly regarded by his supervisors and co-\nworkers, who are fully aware of his alcohol-related incidents, have never seen any other \nindication of an alcohol problem, and recommend him for a security clearance. \nApplicant continues to drink alcohol, but only in moderation. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

At this time, this\ndebt has not been resolved. \nApplicant testified that he had much of this debt, but when he became\nunemployed for a period of at least nine months, he was unable to pay off the debt.\nHowever, as has been discussed above, he had debt that he discharged in bankruptcy\nin 2000, before he was unemployed. \nHe claims that once he gets responses to the letters he sent to the creditors he\nwill begin establishing some kind of a payment plan to pay off these debts. Again, he\nonly sent those letters to the creditors on the day of the hearing. Applicant has taken a\nnumber of online courses to help him better manage his finances. Exhibits I through Q\nare certificates of completion for the various courses taken by Applicant. Based on the\ndates of the certificates, all of these courses were taken within three days before the\nhearing. \nFinally, Applicant testified that in he does not currently have any credit cards, and\nhe has recently finished making payments for his truck. \nThe one witness, who testified on behalf of Applicant, has known him for two\nyears as his supervisor in his current employment. He described Applicant as\n\u201ccompletely honest\u201d and \u201cstraightforward.\u201d   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay all but one of his obligations for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nAs noted above, the financial problems arose at least in 2000 when Applicant\nfirst filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. While he discharged his debt in 2000, he has clearly\naccumulated significant overdue debt since that time, and he has not made a good faith\neffort to resolve his current overdue debts.  I can not conclude that Applicant has acted\nresponsibly under these circumstances because he only attempted to contact most of\nthese creditors on the day of the hearing, and he has sought financial counseling a few\ndays before the hearing that might help him to ascertain a way to resolve these overdue\ndebts. Therefore, I find that no mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this\ncase. \n Applicant has not resolved the great majority of his overdue debt. I conclude that\nuntil he is able to significantly reduce his overdue debt, he has not mitigated the\nfinancial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts\n\n7\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.p.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 1, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. On January 30, 2008, Department Counsel\nindicated the government was prepared to proceed. On February 1, 2008, I received the\ncase assignment and scheduled a hearing for February 28, 2008.\nMarch 14, 2008\n\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and\nthree Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted without any objections. Applicant and\nher supervisor testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on March 10,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant maintains\nCanadian and Israeli citizenship since birth, although she has only a U.S. passport\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), is eligible for social security and other benefits from Canada when she\nretires (SOR \u00b6 1.b), voted in 1995 or 1996 when residing in Canada (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and if\nshe had to choose between U.S. and Canada, Canada holds her loyalty because she\nwas raised there and that is where her heart lies (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted the\nallegations with explanation, including that she was born in Israel to an American\nmother and Canadian father who both registered her as a citizen born abroad. She\nindicated she saw no need to renounce dual citizenship. While she is eligible for\nbenefits from her \u201cnonprofessional and poorly paid\u201d jobs in Canada before she moved to\nthe U.S., she intends to complete her professional career in the U.S. She indicated that\nshe had voted by absentee ballot in the Quebec referendum in October 1995 after\nmoving to the U.S. for graduate study in September 1995, but had since voted only in\nlocal and national elections in the U.S. As far as her expression of choice for Canada,\nApplicant admitted that she dearly loves Canada but would not violate the trust of a\nsecurity clearance which she had held for almost 11 years. After consideration of the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old head archivist of classified and sensitive proprietary\ndocuments who has been employed by a university-affiliated, federally-funded research\nlaboratory since mid-December 1996. She was granted a secret-level security\nclearance in about March 1997, and has since accessed classified material on a daily\nbasis without any violations. She is seeking to retain her secret clearance. (Answer, Ex.\n1, Ex. A, Ex. B, Ex. C, Tr. 18-19, 42-43)\nApplicant was born in November 1959 in Israel to a U.S. native citizen mother\nand a Canadian native citizen father (Ex. 2). Her mother registered her as a U.S. citizen\nborn abroad, and her father registered her birth with Canada. At about age three,\nApplicant moved with her family to Canada, where she was raised with her sister, who\nwas born in Canada in January 1963. (Answer, Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 18-19, 38-40) Applicant\nspent from January 1978 to sometime that summer in Israel but she has not been back\nsince (Tr. 43).\nApplicant began working in Canada as a teen, and over the years she held\npoorly paid, non professional jobs as a library clerk or shelver (Answer). She attended\ncollege in Canada, benefitting from the lower tuition rates available to Canadians (Tr.\n40-41). While pursuing a master of fine arts, Applicant taught a couple of introductory\n\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP lists a July 26, 2005, issuance date (Ex. 1). Applicant testified that the date is incorrect but\n1\nshe was unable to explain the origin of that date (Tr. 59).\n3\nart classes at a college in Quebec. For three years, she worked as a librarian at a not-\nfor-profit center (Answer).\nIn September 1995, Applicant came to the U.S. to pursue graduate study in\nlibrary science (Answer, Tr. 19). She chose to attend a U.S. college because she had\nnever previously lived in the U.S. and wanted a new experience (Tr. 41-42).  In about\nOctober or November 2005, she voted by absentee ballot in a Quebec referendum on\nwhether to separate from the rest of Canada (Answer, Ex. 2, Tr. 49, 56).\nApplicant had initially intended to return to Canada when she finished her\nmaster\u2019s degree (Ex. 2, Tr. 46).  Yet, after earning her degree in August 1996 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n40), she pursued job opportunities in both Canada and the U.S. (Tr. 46). One of her first\njob offers was from her present employer. She had student loans to repay and friends\nhere, so she accepted the offer (Ex. 2, Tr. 47). After receiving a secret-level security\nclearance, Applicant began to handle U.S. classified material and sensitive proprietary\ninformation on a daily basis (Ex. A, Tr. 42-43). She proved to be a reliable custodian of\nboth classified and unclassified archival material (Ex. A, Ex. B).\nAt the request of her employer, Applicant gave up her Canadian passport in\nabout 1998 (Answer, Ex. A, Tr. 19, 56). She acquired her first U.S. passport after\nmoving to the U.S. in 1995 (Tr. 59), and has since renewed it. Her current U.S. passport\nexpires in either 2011 or 2012 (Tr. 59).  \n1\nApplicant applied for renewal of her security clearance, completing an electronic\nquestionnaire for investigations processing on March 19, 2006. She disclosed her\nmultiple citizenship with the U.S., Canada, and Israel from birth, and her possession of\na valid U.S. passport. She also listed her mother\u2019s U.S. citizenship but Canadian\nresidency, her father\u2019s Israeli and Canadian citizenship and Canadian residency, and\nher sister\u2019s U.S. and Canadian citizenship and Canadian residency. (Ex. 1)\nOn May 8, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense. Applicant explained she retained her citizenship with Israel and\nCanada because all the countries with which she has citizenship are part of who she is.\nShe indicated she would not renounce her citizenship with Canada or Israel if necessary\nas a condition of access, and expressed her loyalty to Canada. Asked hypothetically to\nchoose between Canada and the U.S., she indicated she would choose Canada\nbecause that is where she was raised and where her heart is. Applicant also averred\nthat she is serious about her job with the federal contractor and she had not\nexperienced any conflict with her obligations to the U.S.  (Ex. 2).\nApplicant travels to Canada once or twice a year to visit family and friends (Tr.\n50). Her parents, sister, and closest friend reside in Canada (Tr. 47-48), although her\nparents also own a condominium in a retirement community in Florida where they spend\n\n4\nthree to four months every year (Tr. 55). Before he retired, Applicant\u2019s father worked in\nCanada selling or renting office trailers for construction sites (Ex. 2). Applicant\u2019s sister is\nemployed as a junior accounts manager at a fiber optics company in Quebec (Ex. 2).\nApplicant calls her parents weekly and her sister monthly (Ex. 2).\nApplicant intends to complete her career in the U.S., and then retire to Canada\nsome 15 years from now (Answer, Tr. 47). She expects to receive Canadian social\ninsurance benefits akin to U.S. social security when she retires because of her prior\nwork history in Canada (Answer, Ex. 2, Tr. 45). \nApplicant does not own any property in Canada, have any bank accounts in\nCanada, or pay taxes to Canada (Ex. 2, Tr. 51). Since about April 1999, she has had a\ncohabitant personal relationship with a U.S. citizen (Ex. 1, Tr. 42), and they bought their\nhome in the U.S. in May 2002 (Answer, Ex. 1). \nApplicant has not voted in any foreign elections since the 1995 independence\nreferendum in Quebec (Answer, Tr. 49, 56). She has voted in U.S. national elections in\n1996, 2000, and 2004, as well as in several local elections in the U.S. since 1995\n(Answer). She traveled to France in September 2004 and to Italy in September 2005 for\npleasure, using her U.S. passport. She has never held an Israeli passport (Tr. 57) and\ndid not renew her Canadian passport at her employer\u2019s request (Answer).\nApplicant is now willing to unconditionally renounce her Israeli citizenship\nimmediately if asked to do so (Tr. 19, 44). She has not taken any steps to do so (Tr. 45).\nShe would not consider renouncing her Canadian citizenship because it is part of her\nidentity, but she also loves the U.S.:\nI grew up in Canada, I have relatives and close friends there and I love\nthat country dearly but, having said this, I also emphasize that I am an\nAmerican citizen by birth, that I love this country, and that I\u2019ve chosen to\nspend my life here (Tr. 19).\nShe denies she would ever violate the obligations of her clearance (\u201cunder no\ncircumstance would I betray the trust associated with the clearance, I take this trust\nbestowed upon me with the utmost gravity\u201d) (Tr. 20, 53, 54).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor has had the opportunity to observe her handling of\nclassified and sensitive proprietary material for more than 10 years. She has found\nApplicant to be reliable in her custodianship and fastidious in protecting classified and\nrestricted material. Ten years ago, Applicant was promoted to a supervisory position\nherself, and she has \u201cinstilled the same dedication in the 5 employees whom she\nsupervises, and has acted quickly to report problems and implement additional\nsafeguards when necessary.\u201d This supervisor is aware of Applicant\u2019s multiple citizenship\nstatus, and of Applicant\u2019s plan to retire to Canada, but she also considers her \u201ca loyal\ncitizen of the United States with unquestioned allegiance.\u201d She recommends\ncontinuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance without reservation (Ex. A, Tr. 63-71).\n\n5\nAnother coworker who is familiar with Applicant\u2019s work since late 1996, both in\nhis former capacity as assistant to the laboratory\u2019s director and executive officer and\ncurrently as Director\u2019s Staff for Special Projects, has found Applicant to be very diligent\nand responsible in protecting national defense technical information. He has observed\nnothing that would indicate to him that she holds any loyalty higher than that to the U.S.\nand its security. He also has no reservations in recommending her for a clearance (Ex.\nB).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\nApplicant spent several months in Israel in 1978. It is not clear whether she obtained any benefit or privilege\n2\navailable only to Israeli citizens during her stay.\n6\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9) Applicant\nhas been a citizen of the U.S., Canada, and Israel from birth, but she was raised in\nCanada, where she was exposed to, and influenced by, Canadian values and culture.\nHer citizenship with both Israel and the U.S. was for all practical purposes in name only.\nWhen she came to the U.S. in September 1995, she had only a Canadian passport and\nintended to return to Canada after finishing her master\u2019s degree in library science.\nWithin a month or two of her arrival, she voted by absentee ballot in a Quebec\nreferendum. Possession of a foreign passport and voting in a foreign election constitute\nthe active exercise of a foreign citizenship under AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport . . . (7) voting in a foreign election\u201d). Mitigating condition\nAG \u00b6 11(c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a\nminor\u201d) is unavailable to her because she acquired derivative U.S. citizenship at birth.\nHowever, there are noted similarities to the situation of a naturalized U.S. citizen who\nexercises the foreign citizenship he or she had known (i.e., experienced) since the age\nof reason before acquiring U.S. citizenship.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 11(a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d) applies, but only to her Israeli citizenship which\nhas not been exercised since 1978, if at all.  She is now willing to unconditionally\n2\nrenounce her Israeli citizenship, implicating AG \u00b6 11(b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d), but is not willing to renounce her Canadian\ncitizenship. While the U.S. government does not encourage its citizens to remain dual\nnationals because of the complications that might ensue from obligations owed to the\ncountry of second (or in Applicant\u2019s case third) nationality, the Department of Defense\ndoes not require the renunciation of foreign citizenship in order to gain access. Yet there\n\n7\nmust be adequate assurances that a dual citizen will not actively exercise or seek rights,\nbenefits, or privileges of that foreign citizenship.\nApplicant has established significant ties consistent with her U.S. citizenship\nsince 1995/96. She applied for her U.S. passport shortly after her arrival in the U.S.\nAbout a year into her job, she willingly surrendered her Canadian passport at the\nrequest of her employer and has made no attempt to renew it (see AG \u00b6 11(e) (\u201cthe\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated\u201d)). In April 1999, she met her current partner, who is a U.S.\ncitizen, and they bought a home together in the U.S. in May 2002. She has voted in\nfederal and local elections in the U.S. Recent ties to Canada are limited to visits with\nfamily members once or twice a year and telephone calls. Applicant has no bank\naccounts in Canada, and while she plans to retire to Canada and is eligible for social\ninsurance benefits there on her retirement, she is not now accepting any benefits from\nCanada. A future benefit that may or may not come to pass is too speculative an\ninterest to raise current foreign preference concerns. Applicant denied, and there is no\nevidence to the contrary, that she desires to retain her Canadian citizenship to protect\nany present or future benefit.\nNonetheless, when asked by a government investigator in May 2007 which of the\nU.S. or Canada she would choose if she had to, Applicant indicated she would choose\nCanada. While any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States bears serious foreign preference implications (see AG \u00b6 10(d) (\u201cany\nstatement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States: for\nexample, declaration of intent to renounce United States citizenship; renunciation of\nUnited States citizenship\u201d)), the statement must be viewed in context of the hypothetical\nnature of the inquiry and her expressed contemporaneous recognition of the\nseriousness of her obligation to protect U.S. interests. Applicant showed no guile in\nexplaining that she loves Canada (including admitting that is where her heart lies) but\nthat she would not betray the trust associated with her clearance. At her hearing, she\nexpressed her affinity for the U.S. as well as Canada (\u201cI also want to emphasize that I\nam an American citizen by birth, that I love this country, and that I\u2019ve chosen to spend\nmy life here.\u201d Tr. 19). Applicant has handled classified material on a daily basis with due\ndiligence for more than ten years and her concrete actions are entitled to substantial\nweight in assessing the risk of foreign preference. Her ties to the U.S. have only\nstrengthened since she was granted her clearance, and she intends to reside and work\nhere for the next 15 years. She is not likely to act in preference for Canada or any other\nforeign country over the U.S.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. The coworkers who know Applicant through daily\ninteraction with her for more than 10 years have no reservations about recommending\ncontinuation of her security clearance. She has shown herself to be forthright with the\ngovernment about her strong sentimental bonds to Canada, and at the same time very\ncapable of fulfilling her obligations of a clearance and U.S. citizenship. Based on the\nevidence before me, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue the clearance she has held and actively exercised without any violations since\n1997.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is continued.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his failure to\nfile state and federal income tax returns and pay taxes that remain owing.  \nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 28, 2008, in which\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nhe admitted all SOR allegations, denied they created a security concern, and requested\na clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 12, 2008,\nthat was mailed to Applicant on May 14, 2008. Applicant was informed he had 30 days\nfrom receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional information he\nwanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on May 25, 2008. He\ntimely submitted one document in response to the FORM that was forwarded to\nDepartment Counsel on July 1, 2008. Department Counsel indicated she did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s submission and the case was then assigned to me on July 8, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 68-year-old man who has been employed as a consultant by a\ndefense contractor since November 2001. The security clearance application contained\nin the FORM indicates Applicant was employed by a government agency from April 1961\nuntil his retirement therefrom in June 2001. He worked in various positions and at several\nlocations throughout the United States for that government agency. His last position with\nthe agency was as a program analyst from June 1988 to June 2001.\nApplicant has been married three times. His first marriage lasted  from June 1960\nuntil December 1982. The second marriage lasted from July 1984 until April 2000. These\ntwo marriages ended by divorce. Applicant has been married to his current wife since\nJanuary 2001. He has three adult children.\nApplicant moved to his current state of residence in January 2000. He lived in his\nprior state of residence from February 1987 until January 2000. Applicant failed to file an\nincome tax return in his former state of residence for the last year (1999) he resided there.\nHe also failed file tax returns in his current state of residence from 2000 to 2006. There is\nno indication in the FORM Applicant has yet filed an income tax return or paid any taxes\nthat may or may not be due in his former state of residence for the year 1999.   \nInterrogatories were sent to Applicant by DOHA inquiring about the status of the\nalleged unpaid state income taxes in or about October 2007. Applicant responded to the\ninterrogatories and admitted he had not filed state income tax returns for the years in\nquestion. Thereafter, he filed the income tax returns for the missing years in his current\nstate of residence. In December 2007 and February 2008, he paid the state $40,710 in\npast due taxes and $4,266.73 in penalties and interest. There remained a balance due for\npenalties and interest of $15,943.44. Applicant entered into an installment agreement with\nthe state whereby he is to pay $664.31 per month for 24 months to liquidate the past due\ninterest and penalties. He made payments of $700 in March and April in accord with the\nagreement.\nApplicant also did not file federal income tax returns for the years 2002, 2004 and\n2005 until after he received DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. In response to the interrogatories,\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n3\nApplicant stated he filed the delinquent federal income tax returns in October 2007, and\nowed the IRS $129,849 in back taxes, including penalties and interest. In his answer to the\nSOR, he indicated he had entered into a tentative installment agreement with the IRS to\nsatisfy the delinquent taxes. He included a copy of a check, dated April 16, 2008, payable\nto the U.S. Treasury in the amount of $2,700 which indicates it is a payment on the\ntentative installment agreement.   \nApplicant obtained the funds to pay the delinquent state taxes from IRA and TSP\nwithdrawals, profits from the sale of two houses, pension funds, and his income. In his\nresponse to the FORM, Applicant indicated he was continuing to make the required\npayments under the installment plans he has entered into.\nIn his response to the interrogatories, Applicant attributed his failure to file state and\nfederal income tax returns and pay the taxes owed to expenses related to relocating to his\ncurrent state of residence in 1999/2000, records being difficult to locate because of that\nmove, his last divorce and remarriage, and the deaths of his ex-wife, his mother, and other\nunidentified relatives. He did not further elaborate on how locating records affected his\nability to file income tax returns for the years after he moved or how the other cited events\naffected his ability to either file income tax returns or pay taxes as they became due.\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n10\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant failed to file state and federal income tax returns or pay taxes that he\nowed for many years. As a result, he owed approximately $190,000 in delinquent state and\nFederal income taxes at the time he received interrogatories from DOHA. Shortly\nthereafter, he filed the delinquent returns and paid about $50,000 toward the taxes, interest\nand penalties he owed. He obtained the funds to make those payments by selling real\nestate he owned and withdrawing funds from retirement accounts. Accepting his claim in\nhis response to the FORM that he has continued to make the required payments on the\ninstallment agreements he has entered into, Applicant may have paid about an additional\n$12,000 since the SOR was filed. Thus, he still owes somewhere in the vicinity of $125,000\nfor past due taxes, interests and penalties.\n  \n\n5\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; DC\n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and DC 19(g): failure to file annual\nFederal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same\napply. \nApplicant provided only vague explanations for his failure to file the required state\nand federal income tax returns or pay the taxes that he owed. He provided no reason to\nconclude that he lacked the ability to either file the returns or pay the taxes because of any\ncircumstance that was beyond his ability to control. Thus, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b):\nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances does not apply. \nApplicant did promptly file the delinquent income tax returns, pay the amounts he\ncould, and enter into repayment agreements for the balances owing once he received the\ninterrogatories from DOHA. However, it is noteworthy that he submitted an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in September 2006, disclosed therein\nthat he owed delinquent state and federal income taxes, and wrote: \nI have delinquent Federal and State Income Taxes due to not filing and\npaying. I am currently in contact with the Internal Revenue Service on these\nissues. I am in the process of preparing my past Federal and State Income\nTax returns. I hope to have all my returns filed soon. The income taxes,\npenalties, and interest will be paid from current resources to the extent\npossible and installments if necessary. (Item 4, Section 28)\nDespite these assertions Applicant made in the e-QIP, there is nothing in the FORM that\nindicates he took any action to file the delinquent returns or pay the past due taxes until\nafter he received the interrogatories from DOHA and was, thereby, made aware of the\npotential impact these matters might have on him retaining a security clearance. The\npayments having apparently only been made under this duress, I conclude MC 20(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\ndoes not apply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this\ncase. \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns caused by the financial considerations that are present in this case. He\n\n6\nhas not overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                            \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 58 years old and an employee of a defense contractor working in a U.S. Army laboratory performing research in the area of infrared photo detectors. He received his undergraduate degree from a university in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 1981, and a master\u2019s degree in physics from a United States university in 1994.

His father was a university professor classified by the communist Chinese government as a person opposed to the communist rule. His mother was an accountant. From 1957 until 1965, the family was exiled to a small town in the countryside. The living conditions were bad. In 1966 at the start of the Cultural Revolution in China, the family was treated as second or third class citizens. 3 Applicant was prohibited from starting college and was required to work on farms for ten years.

(Tr. 23-26)  The request and the \nattached supporting documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in \nthe record as Hearing Exhibit I.  Applicant had no objection to the request for \nadministrative notice and the attached documents.  The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant initially denied all the factual allegations in \nthe SOR, with explanations.  Applicant subsequently admitted all the factual allegations \nin the SOR with explanation. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 58 years old and an employee of a defense contractor working in a \nU.S. Army laboratory performing research in the area of infrared photo detectors.  He \nreceived his undergraduate degree from a university in the Peoples Republic of China \n(PRC) in 1981, and a master\u2019s degree in physics from a United States university in \n1994.  (Tr. 38-41; Government Exhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, E-QIP, dated \nNovember 20, 2006)   \n \nApplicant was born in the PRC.  His father was a university professor classified \nby the communist Chinese government as a person opposed to the communist rule.  \nHis mother was an accountant.  From 1957 until 1965, the family was exiled to a small \ntown in the countryside.  The living conditions were bad.  In 1966 at the start of the \nCultural Revolution in China, the family was treated as second or third class citizens.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was prohibited from starting college and was required to work on farms for ten \nyears.  In 1977, he started college at age 27.  (Tr. 28-30) \n \nAfter college, he taught physics at a college from 1981 until 1988.  He was \ntreated badly, and could not be promoted because of his political views.  He and his \nfamily were typical political victims of the communist rule in China.  (Tr. 30) \n \nWhen Applicant came to the United States in 1990 to attend college, he had a \nPRC passport.  He renewed the passport in April 2000 before becoming a U.S. citizen, \nand it expired in April 2005. (Applicant Exhibit B, Passport, dated April 20, 2000)  He \nbecame a United States citizen on August 25, 2000, and was issued a U.S. passport in \nOctober 2000. (Applicant Exhibit C, Passport dated October 31, 2000)  His PRC \npassport has expired. \n \nApplicant stated he came to the United States to pursue a better life.  He could \nno longer tolerate inequity, injustices, lack of human rights, and poverty in the PRC.  \nThe United States to him was a country of freedom, equal opportunity, and open society \ntreating everyone fairly without discrimination.  He is happy with his better life in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 27-28) \n \nApplicant has been married three times.  His first wife was born in the PRC but is \na United States citizen.  The marriage ended in divorce issued by a U.S. court in 2000.  \n(Tr. 34-35; Applicant Exhibit D, Divorce Stipulation and Property Settlement Agreement, \ndated January 11, 2000)  He has a son from this marriage who is a resident and citizen \nof the United States.  He lost contact with his son and last talked to him in 2000. (Tr. 44, \n55)  His second wife is a PRC citizen.  Applicant has lost contact with her and does not \nknow her location.  The marriage also ended in divorce issued by a U.S. court in 2003.  \n(Tr. 35; Applicant Exhibit E, Marital Separation Agreement, dated April 10, 2003).  He \nmarried for the third time on December 14, 2004, in the United States to a woman who \nis a citizen of the PRC, but now resides with him in the United States. (Applicant Exhibit \nF (Marriage License, dated December 14, 2004)  He has a daughter from this marriage \nwho is a citizen and resident of the United States.  His present wife has a twelve year \nold son who resides in the PRC. He and his wife do not pay child support but his wife \noccasionally sends her son gifts.  Applicant has no contact with the step-son.  His wife \nand Applicant do intend to have the boy join them in the United States.  His wife first \nhas to gain custody of the boy.  They have talked to the boy\u2019s father but have not \nstarted any procedures.  He has not talked to the boy\u2019s father but his wife has talked to \nhim once. (Tr. 36, 44-47, and 55)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 85 years old and a resident and citizen of the PRC.  His \nfather is deceased.  His mother still lives in the small town the family was exiled to in \n1957.  His mother has diabetes and a heart condition and stays in bed most of the time.  \nHe calls occasionally, about once a year.  He does not send her money because she \nhas a retirement income from the company she was employed by as an accountant.  \nShe lives alone but his brother in the PRC hired someone to care for her.  He does not \nnormally help with her care but will send her money if asked to defray medical \n\n \n4 \n \n \nexpenses. The last money sent was $500 about two years ago.  If she asked for money \nand help, he would help her. (Tr. 30, 40-43)   \n \nApplicant has a brother and sister who are residents and citizens of the PRC.  \nHis brother is a retired chief executive officer of a small chemical products company \nwho now does consulting work for the company when asked.  He talks to his brother by \nphone when he calls his mother and his brother is with his mother.  The last time he \ntalked to his brother was February 2004.  He does not provide financial support for his \nbrother.  Applicant\u2019s sister is a retired accountant for a company in the PRC.  He last \ntalked to his sister by telephone in 2004.  His brother and sister have not visited \nApplicant or anyone else in the United States. (Tr. 47-50) \n \nApplicant has traveled to PRC five times.  He made three trips in 2000.  The \npurpose of his first trip was to visit his parents, but he also met his second wife.  He \nmade a second trip that year to marry her, but she remained in PRC.  He visited her \nlater in 2000.  He made a trip from December 2002 until January 2003 to visit his \nsecond wife, who he had divorced, and also met his third wife.  He returned for his fifth \ntrip in January/February 2004 to become engaged to his present wife.  All of his trips \nwere no more than a month in length, mostly in December and January over the holiday \nbreak, and spent in his parents\u2019 home area or that of his wife.  He normally stayed with \nhis parents or in hotels.  He has not returned to PRC since early 2004.  He has no plans \nto return to PRC in the near future. (Tr. 50-51; Applicant Exhibit A, Summary of trips to \nChina, undated)  He used his PRC passport for all trips before he became a citizen and \nwas issued a U.S. passport.  He used his U.S. passport for all trips taken after October \n2000 when he received his U.S. passport. (Tr. 50) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a retired medical doctor who is a resident and citizen \nof PRC.  She visited Applicant and his wife in the United States twice to assist his wife \nwith the care of their infant daughter.  She first visited in 2005 and stayed five months.  \nShe visited again in 2007 for four months.  They would like to have her immigrate to live \nwith them in the United States as soon as his wife becomes a citizen.  He provides her \nno financial assistance. (Tr. 51-54)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s present wife testified she met Applicant through a matchmaker in \nJanuary 2004 in PRC.  She came to the United States in November 2004 and married \nApplicant in December 2004.  They have a daughter born in October 2005.  She \nbelieves her husband loves his wife and child.  He is a good father.  He works hard and \nis diligent.  She has a son from a former marriage living with his father in PRC. She \ntalks to him about once every other month.  She does not send him money regularly but \ndoes send gifts on special occasions.  She and her husband would like to bring the boy \nto the United States as soon as she can gain his custody.  She speaks to her mother in \nthe PRC about once every two or three months.  She has no plans to travel to PRC.  \nHer mother has no plans for future trips to the U.S. (Tr. 57-62) \n \nApplicant\u2019s work colleague testified that he has worked in the same laboratory \nwith Applicant for almost two years, but has known him for over eight years.  They \n\n \n5 \n \n \npreviously worked for the same company.  He remembers an incident when he had \nbeen laid off from the former employer but Applicant still worked for them.  He called \nApplicant for information to prepare for a job interview.  Since the witness no longer \nworked for the company, Applicant refused to provide the information.  Applicant was \nloyal to his agreements and the company. He believes Applicant is strongly loyal to the \nUnited States. (Tr. 65-71) \n \n \nChina, also known as the People's Republic of China, is hostile to the United \nStates, and has interests inimical to those of the U.S.  China is ruled by a totalitarian \ngovernment that depends on the suppression of its people. The government has a poor \nrecord of human rights that features, among other things, repression of political and \nreligious dissenters.  There have been some improvements in relations between PRC \nand the United States.  While the United States looks forward to a constructive and \nbroad-based relationship with China, a message reiterated by President Bush when he \nmet with PRC President Hu in April 2006, there are areas of potential disagreement.   \n \n \nChina is known to engage in espionage against the U.S., both economically, \nmilitarily, and otherwise.  The United States is a primary intelligence target of PRC \nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military, \npolitical, and economic presence in Asia and the Pacific Rim; its role as a developer of \nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry who are considered prime intelligence targets by the \nPRC.  The intelligence practice of the PRC is different from the Soviet and western \nconcept of the use of recruited agents.  The western approach is to recruit agents for a \nspecific intelligence target.  The PRC intelligence philosophy is to try to recruit agents \nbefore there is a specific need, and recruit as many as possible.  The crux of the PRC \napproach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s \ndesire to help China out in some ways.  A large portion of the PRC intelligence \ncollection efforts against common targets is conducted directly by PRC students, \ndelegations, and commercial enterprises.  They also believe if large numbers of PRC \npersonnel leave China and settle permanently in the United States, some of them may \nsome day find their way into positions of intelligence potential.  When they are in \nposition, these individuals will be approached on the basis of loyalty to their ancestral \nland, and some may be persuaded to cooperate, at least on a limited basis.  (Court \nExhibit 1, Government Request for Administrative Notice, Intelligence Threat Handbook, \nat 17-24) \n \n \nChinese security personnel place foreign visitors under surveillance and subject \nthem to search without their knowledge or consent.  However, there is no information in \nintelligence documents that the PRC is targeting relatives of Chinese-Americans to gain \naccess to classified, technical, or business information from their relatives in the United \nStates.  However in recent years, the PRC has been the subject of approximately half of \nthe cases initiated by U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning the illegal diversion of \ntechnology from the United States.  These cases involve people born and raised in the \nPRC who immigrated to the United States and became United States citizens.  The \nPRC relies on recruitment and exploitation operations.  The PRC attempts to recruit or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nat least \u201cmake friends with\u201d as many Chinese-Americans as possible, apparently hoping \nthat at least some will perceive an obligation to help China,  (Court Exhibit 1, Request \nfor Administrative Notice, Attached State Department and Intelligence Service \ndocuments) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity \nof the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is location, \nincluding but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known \nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant has contact with his mother, mother-in-law, brother, sister, and step-\nson, who are all citizens and residents of the PRC.  His wife, a citizen of PRC residing in \nthe United States, has contacts with her mother in PRC.  These contacts may be \nminimal or infrequent, but they raise security concerns under Foreign Influence \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 79(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion); AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information); and AG \n\u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, \nif that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion). \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could created a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) and determine all apply to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, App. Bd. \nJul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR Case No. \n03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nThe nature of the country in which persons are located is an issue.  There are \nsome indications that China and the United States are working towards more friendly \nrelations.  There is no doubt that the PRC targets the United States for scientific, \nintelligence, technical, and military information.  Security concerns can be raised from \ncountries both friendly and hostile to the United States.  The United States has an \ninterest to protect its classified information whether the person, organization, or country \nseeking the information has interests inimical to the United States. (ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570, App. Bd. May 19, 2004 at 5)  Friendly countries can have disagreements with \nthe United States over matters that are vital to the national security of the United States.  \nFriendly countries have engaged in espionage against the United States while seeking \neconomic, scientific, and technical information.  (ISCR Case No. 00-0317, App. Bd. May \n29, 2002)  The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., its human \nrights record, and its intelligence collection methods are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is dependent on or associated with \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nU.S.  Applicant has a heavy burden to establish that PRC does not create a security \nconcern. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is elderly and in poor health.  She lives in a small town, \nworked for a private company and not the government, and relies on retirement income \nfrom the company and not the government to live.  Applicant talks to her by telephone \nonly about once a year, so the contact is infrequent.  He sent her money to help with \nmedical costs only once and has not sent her funds in many years.  He has not talked to \nhis sister in over four years, and only talks to his brother if he is at his mother\u2019s house \nwhen he calls one time a year.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his mother and siblings in the \nPRC are infrequent and minimal.  Since his mother and siblings are family members, \nthere contact cannot be considered casual, even though the contacts are infrequent and \nminimal.   \n \n \nHis mother-in-law is a retired doctor.  She visited Applicant and his wife in the \nUnited States but he does not speak to her when she is in PRC.  He has not seen or \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntalked to his step son.  Applicant and his wife would like to sponsor the mother-in-law \nand step-son to come to the United States.  The contact with them to have them \nimmigrate would normally be frequent and extensive.  However, there is only telephonic \ncontact with them every few months.  Applicant does not even talk to the step-son.  \nThey have not taken any significant steps to gain custody of the step-son so he can \ncome to the United States.  The contact with the mother-in-law and step-son in the PRC \nis minimal, infrequent, and casual. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s trips back to PRC do not show an interest in the PRC but were taken \nto see his parents and his former wife, as well as to court his new wife.  The trips were \nnot made because of his desire to see the PRC or for government purposes.  His last \ntrip was over four years ago, so his trips do not create a conflict of interest.  \n  \n \nThe government documents used for administrative notice purposes show that \nthe PRC approach to intelligence gathering is different than the western approach.  The \nPRC does not target people, like his family members, to pressure, or coerce Applicant \nto reveal information not in the U.S. interests.  In balancing the nature of the contacts \nand visits with his family and relatives in the PRC, and the intelligence approach of the \nPRC against Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States, I determine that Applicant is not \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by the PRC, and cannot be manipulated or induced \nto help PRC in a way that is against U.S. interest by the location of his family in the \nPRC. \n \n \nThe PRC approach to intelligence gathering does seem to target individuals of \nChinese ancestry in the United States.  The administrative judge must again balance \nthe nature of the loyalty of the individual to the United States against his loyalty to the \nPRC.  In this case, Applicant has a strong sense of loyalty to the United States and no \nloyalty or love for the PRC.  He and his family suffered under PRC rule, they were sent \nto the countryside, he was not immediately able to follow his desires for an education, \nand he was discriminated against because of his family background.  His most \nsignificant tie to the PRC is to marry women from that country.  Applicant has little if any \nsense of loyalty to the PRC.  He has a deep sense of loyalty and admiration for the \nUnited States and its way of life.  He became a United States citizen, travels on his \nUnited States passport, brought his new wife to this country and married her here, his \ndaughter is a United States citizen, and he has property here.  He sees the United \nStates as offering him freedom, justice, and tolerance with an opportunity to reach his \npotential.  His sense of loyalty or obligation is not to the PRC but to the United States.  \nA conflict of interest in this case is extremely unlikely.  I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty \nto the United States is such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.  Accordingly, Applicant has met his heavy burden to show that \nhis contacts in the PRC do not cause a security concern.  I conclude AGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), \nand (c) are established. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has strong loyalties to the \nUnited States and a strong lack of loyalty for the PRC.  His contacts with his family in \nPRC are not strong and do not create a conflict of interest between them and his loyalty \nto the United States.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from \nforeign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B :  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "findings of fact: While a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, Applicant removed certain sporting goods items from a retail store without paying for them. Applicant was detained by the store\u2019s security officers and held for the local police. Applicant\u2019s detention led to discovery of the fact that he had manufactured false military identification cards for himself and at least two other midshipmen. At that time, Applicant was not \u201chandcuffed, photographed, fingerprinted, or placed under arrest.\u201d Decision at 2. Applicant was subsequently served with a theft charge/summons at home.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 14, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found his criminal conduct to be\nmitigated, and he disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his testimony was \u201cnot fully candid.\u201d\nApplicant also disagrees with the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis and lists positive factors the Judge\nshould have considered in that analysis. \nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nWhile a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, Applicant removed certain\nsporting goods items from a retail store without paying for them.  Applicant was detained by the\nstore\u2019s security officers and held for the local police.  Applicant\u2019s detention led to discovery of the\nfact that he had manufactured false military identification cards for himself and at least two other\nmidshipmen.  At that time, Applicant was not \u201chandcuffed, photographed, fingerprinted, or placed\nunder arrest.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Applicant was subsequently served with a theft charge/summons at\nhome.  Applicant was found guilty of theft in a civilian court and placed on unsupervised probation\nbefore judgment.  He completed his term of probation without incident.  As a result of a\nCommandant\u2019s Hearing under the Naval Academy\u2019s Administrative Conduct System, Applicant was\ndisenrolled from the Academy.  Some of the charges Applicant faced at that hearing were based on\narticles under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  \nIn November 2007, Applicant drove his car after consuming alcoholic beverages.  He was\nforced to make an emergency stop after one of his tires blew out.  A policeman who stopped to\nrender assistance smelled alcohol and administered a field sobriety test, which Applicant failed.  On\nhis own initiative, Applicant attended a program concerned with alcohol abuse.  In July 2008,\nApplicant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and was placed on\nprobation before judgment for 12 months.  As a result, Applicant is required to visit his probation\noffice monthly and pay a fee.  Applicant will be on probation until July 2009.  \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in February 2007.  When asked in\nquestion 23(e) as to whether he had been subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings\nunder the UCMJ in the last seven years, Applicant answered \u201cno,\u201d because he did not believe his\nhearing before the Commandant was a proceeding under the UCMJ.  When asked in question 23(f)\nof the application whether he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not\n\n3\nlisted in response to other questions, Applicant failed to list the theft incident mentioned above.\nApplicant stated that he did not believe that he had been arrested and believed that he did not need\nto list it because it was removed from his record when he successfully completed his probation.\nAlthough Applicant did not mention the theft incident on his application, he did disclose it in a\nfollow-up interview with a government investigator.\nIn the SOR, the theft and the DUI were listed under Guideline J.  The Guideline E\nsubparagraphs included the theft incident, the false identification cards, and Academy disenrollment,\nas well as falsification regarding the disenrollment and the theft.  In his Formal Findings, the Judge\nfound against Applicant as to both subparagraphs under Guideline J and as to all but one of the\nsubparagraphs under Guideline E.\nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot fully\ncandid.\u201d  Decision at 7.  A Judge\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to deference on appeal.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The party challenging a Judge\u2019s credibility determination has a heavy burden\nof persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  Applicant has not\nmet that burden.  \nApplicant also disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding mitigation.  In support of\nhis position, Applicant repeats portions of his explanations for his conduct.  He also lists mitigating\nfactors which he believes should have led the Judge to a whole-person analysis favorable to\nApplicant.  The Judge found some evidence of mitigation.  However, the application of disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or\nmore of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-05439 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 29, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or\nvice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-22515 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge discussed the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines J and E.  Looking at both the favorable and unfavorable record evidence, the Judge\nreasonably explained why Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation did not overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-09048 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2008).  The Judge has drawn\n\u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse decision.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\nAss\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin               \nJean E.

Furthermore, he falsified his security clearance \napplication. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) or Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86 Format) on February 3, \n2007. On April 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 26, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2008. The first \nNotice of Hearing was issued on June 17, 2008, convening a hearing on July 7, 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney entered his appearance on July 1, 2008, and requested a \ncontinuance. The final Notice of Hearing was issued on July 7, 2008, convening a \nhearing on August 11, 2008. At the hearing, the Government presented six exhibits, \nmarked GE 1-6, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 15). Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, and presented five exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-5, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 19, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n2.a, 2.b, and 2.c, with explanations. He admitted he was charged with theft and driving \nwhile impaired (DWI). He denied he was ever arrested in relation to those offenses. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old software engineer working for a government \ncontractor. He has never been married and has no children. He completed high school \nin 2002 with a 3.9 grade point average (GPA) (Tr. 17). Following high school, Applicant \nwas admitted into the U.S. Naval Academy (Academy). He attended the Academy for \nabout one academic year, achieved a 3.3 average. He participated in boxing and \nwrestling, and was considered by Cadre and fellow midshipmen to be among the top \none-third midshipmen of his class. He distinguished himself by making the Dean\u2019s List \nand the Superintendent\u2019s List (Tr. 18, GE 4).  \n \n \n \nIn May 2004, Applicant visited a retail store and stole a fishing vest and other \nfishing supplies (Tr. 21-23). He was with three other midshipmen. Applicant and his \nfriends were violating several midshipmen regulations by taking advantage of privileges \nthey were not authorized. He claimed he did not take the merchandise off the shelf. He \naverred one of his friends took the merchandise off the shelf, they passed it along \nthemselves in the store, and ultimately he walked out of the store without paying for the \nitems. He claimed they were joking around and, at the time, he believed it would make a \nfunny prank to steal the merchandise. He acknowledge that what he did was wrong and \nattributed his behavior to being young and stupid (Tr. 22-23). \n \n \n \nHe was detained by the store\u2019s loss prevention officers and held for the arrival of \npolice officers (Tr. 24). Applicant had in his possession a false military identification card \nhe manufactured. Applicant also had manufactured at least two other false identification \ncards for fellow midshipmen. After the police officers took his personal information, he \nwas allowed to leave the store on his own. He was not handcuffed, photographed, \nfingerprinted, or placed under arrest. At a later date, he was served with the theft (under \n$500) charge/summons at his home.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant was found guilty of the theft charge and placed on \nunsupervised probation before judgment. He completed his term of probation without \nincidents (Tr. 26). At the Academy, Applicant underwent a Commandant\u2019s Hearing \nunder the Academy\u2019s Administrative Conduct System. Some of the administrative \ncharges he faced were based on punitive articles under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ), i.e., conspiracy (Article 81), false official statements (Article 107), \nlarceny (Article 121), and conduct unbecoming a midshipman (Article 133).  \n \n \n \nApplicant was disenrolled from the Academy as a result of his theft, \nmanufacturing false military identification cards for himself and other midshipmen, and \nfor his violation of other midshipmen regulations. After his disenrollment from the \nAcademy, Applicant continued his education at a university. He completed the \nrequirements of his Bachelor of Science (computers) degree and graduated in August \n2008 (Tr. 20). \n \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant went out partying with some friends and drove his \ncar after consuming alcoholic beverages (Tr. 36-38). Applicant was forced to make an \nemergency stop after one of his car tires blew up, exposing the rim and throwing sparks \nall over. A police officer saw the incident and stopped to render assistance. He noticed \nApplicant smelled of alcohol and administered a field sobriety test which Applicant \nfailed. He was charged with driving while impaired by drugs and/or alcohol; driving while \nimpaired by controlled dangerous substance, and driving damage causing vehicle on \nhighway. He immediately took the initiate to attend rehabilitation/alcohol counseling. In \nJuly 2008, Applicant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The \nother charges were dismissed. He was placed on probation before judgment for a \nperiod of 12 months. As part of his probation, he is required to visit his probation office \nonce a month and to pay a fee. \n \n \n \nIn his response to question 23.e of his February 2007 security clearance \napplication, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether in the last seven years \nhe had been subject to court-martial or other disciplinary proceeding under the UCMJ. \nThe Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s Commandant\u2019s Hearing conducted pursuant \nto the Academy\u2019s Administrative Conduct System was a proceeding under the UCMJ, \nand that Applicant falsified his SF 86 when he failed to disclose it. Applicant testified he \ndid not falsify his SF 86, because he believed the Commandant\u2019s Hearing was not a \nproceeding under the UCMJ (Tr. 30).  \n \n \n \nI find that a Commandant\u2019s Hearing is an Academy administrative proceeding \nand not a proceeding under the UCMJ. The phrase a \u201cproceeding under the UCMJ\u201d \nrefers to those actions specifically authorized by the UCMJ such as non-judicial \npunishment pursuant to Article 15 of UCMJ, or one of the three different levels of courts-\nmartial - Summary, Special or General Courts-martial, provided under Article 16 of the \nUCMJ. Thus, Applicant was not required to disclose he underwent a Commandant\u2019s \nHearing at the Academy in his answer to question 23.e. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nQuestion 23.f asked whether in the last seven years Applicant had been arrested \nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in response to other questions. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose he was charged with theft in May 2004. \nHe did not believe he was ever arrested because he was not place in handcuffs, \ndetained, or in custody by the police. He was allowed to go free after his interview. \nConsidering the record evidence, I find Applicant was not arrested. \n \n \n \nApplicant explained he failed to disclose his theft charge because he lacked \nunderstanding of the legal semantics (Tr. 12). Applicant claimed he had the honest \nbelief that his conviction was set aside and removed from his records when he \ncompleted his probation. His belief was based on his then attorney\u2019s advice (the \nattorney that represented him for the theft charge) that if he successfully completed his \nprobation, under the state\u2019s \u201cprobation before judgment\u201d rules, his conviction would be \nset aside and removed from his record. \n \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant asserted that although he mistakenly failed to disclose his \ntheft charge, he corrected his mistake by being candid and forthcoming with a \nGovernment investigator during an interview conducted after he submitted his February \n2007 SF 86. Applicant was called for a follow-up interview with a Government \ninvestigator in May 2007. Applicant did not request the interview. During the interview, \nthe investigator asked Applicant whether there was anything else he wanted to disclose. \nHe disclosed the circumstances related to his 2004 theft charge and the subsequent \nprobation before judgment. \n \n \n \nApplicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since \nMay 2006. While at the Academy he was granted access to classified information at the \nsecret level. Apparently, his secret clearance was not withdrawn when he was \ndisenrolled from the Academy. His access was continued after he was hired by his \ncurrent employer to the day to the hearing. He needs his security clearance to work in \nGovernment contracts and to access his customer\u2019s facilities (Tr. 45). While working for \nhis employer, Applicant has been placed in positions of responsibility such as \nsupervising two other employees, and handling sensitive matters. He has consistently \nperformed well and has received no complaints from his supervisors or customers. \nThere is not evidence he has ever compromised or caused others to compromise \nclassified information.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not disclosed to his employer the circumstances related to both the \ntheft and DUI charges and the resulting probationary periods. He was concerned about \nthe possible adverse impact it may have on his ability to retain his job if his employer \nfound out about these incidents (Tr. 71). His employer knows about Applicant\u2019s \ndisenrollment of the Academy, but he does not know the details. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his questionable behavior in 2004 and 2007. He \naverred he has matured and now understands the serious consequences of his actions.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant was 20 years old and had completed one year at the Academy when \nhe stole merchandise from a retailer in 2004. He also created false identification cards \nfor himself and others, and violated several of the Academy\u2019s midshipmen rules. He \nwas 23 years old when he drove his car under the influence of alcohol in 2007. He was \ngiven probation before judgment as a result of his July 2008 DUI conviction, and was \nplaced on one-year supervised probation. Applicant will be on probation until July 2009. \nFurthermore, Applicant falsified his security clearance application when he failed to \ndisclose he was charged with theft. His falsification of the security clearance application \nis material and a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1001, a felony.4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior raises security concerns under Criminal Conduct \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(d) \n\u201cindividual is currently on probation or parole or probation.\u201d Applicant=s recent \nfalsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct concerns raised by his past \nbehavior. The Government did not allege the falsification under Guideline J. Thus, the \nfalsification of the security clearance cannot be used as grounds to deny Applicant\u2019s \napplication under Guideline J. However, I am required to consider Applicant=s overall \nquestionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent; the \n \n4  It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. See Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 527 (discussing 18 U.S.C. ' 1001). The SOR does not allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 as \ncriminal conduct, and I have not based my determination on the applicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \nlikelihood of recurrence; Applicant=s explanations concerning the circumstances of the \nincidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.5 \n \n \nAG & 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that \nnone apply. Applicant\u2019s theft happened four years ago, and except for the falsification of \nthe security clearance application, it could be considered temporally remote. However, \nhis recent falsification of the security clearance application brings to the forefront the \ncriminal conduct concerns. Considering the evidence as a whole, the theft, the DUI, and \nthe falsification are recent. Applicant receives some credit in mitigation because he \nexpressed remorse for his past behavior, he attended rehabilitation/alcohol counseling, \nand he has a good employment record working for a defense contractor.  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, because of the nature and seriousness of the offenses \n(particularly the falsification); because of his age, education, and occupation at the time \nof the offenses; and the fact that he is still on probation for his DUI; the passage of time, \nhis counseling, ongoing rehabilitation, expressed remorse, and good job performance \nare insufficient to mitigate his criminal behavior.  \n \n \nMoreover, having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and considering his testimony \nin light of the record evidence, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony was not fully candid and \nforthright, and that he tried to minimize aspects of his questionable behavior, i.e., his \nparticipation in the theft, the circumstances surrounding his DUI, and the falsification of \nthe SF 86. Applicant\u2019s overall behavior cast serious doubts about his judgment, \nreliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. AG & 15. \n \nApplicant admitted, and the government\u2019s evidence established, he failed to \ndisclose relevant information in his answer to questions 23.f of his security clearance \napplication. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach \nthat conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, his employment and \neducation history, and his demeanor and testimony. He knew the importance of \naccurate completion of his security clearance application, and nevertheless failed to \nprovide information that was material to making an informed security decision. Applicant \nalso has not disclosed to his employer the circumstances surrounding the theft, his \n \n5  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndisenrollment from the Academy, and his DUI. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(a): \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of \ninformation about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d apply. \n \nI considered all Guideline E mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply. \nApplicant=s falsification is recent, and his favorable information is not sufficient to apply \nany of the mitigating conditions. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17.a: \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts,\u201d and find it does not apply. A Government \ninvestigator arranged for the interview and asked an open ended question - whether \nApplicant had anything else to disclose, then Applicant disclosed his theft charge. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence failed to establish he disclosed his theft charge and conviction \nbefore confrontation. Applicant\u2019s omission was not caused by improper advice of legal \ncounsel advising him concerning the security clearance process, thus, AG \u00b6 17.b, does \nnot apply. I do not consider Applicant\u2019s falsification a minor offense, and it is temporally \nrecent, AG \u00b6 17.c, does not apply. Applicant also has failed to reduce his vulnerability to \nexploitation because of failure to fully disclose to his employer the theft, his \ndisenrollment from the Academy, and his DUI. AG \u00b6 17.e, does not apply. Additionally, \nfor the same reasons outlined under the discussion of Guidelines J, incorporated herein, \nI conclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable judgment, lack of reliability, and \nuntrustworthiness.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, maturity level, both at the time of each incident of misconduct and at the time \nof his hearing. I considered his four years of good performance for a defense contractor. \nWhile employed, he had access to classified information without causing security \nconcerns or problems. I considered that he is doing well on his probation, and in his \nrehabilitation efforts. On balance, the record evidence does not convince me of \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and personal conduct \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c, and 2.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

On October 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 21, 2007. He submitted a \nsupplemental answer on December 8, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 16, \nMay 14, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n2008, and I received the case assignment on January 17, 2008. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on January 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 12, 2008. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through M, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. I held the record \nopen until February 22, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant timely submitted AE N through S without objection, which were \nforwarded to me by Department Counsel by letters dated February 22, 2008 (Exhibit \n(Ex.) I and II). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 21, 2008. \nThe record closed on February 22, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.c. \u2013 1.j. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b. After a \nthorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old supply technician chief, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since August 2003. Tr. 21-22. He graduated from high school in \nJune 1982, and did not pursue higher education. Tr. 19. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. Tr. 22-24. \n \nApplicant married his wife in March 1989, separated from her in September \n2001, and was granted a final divorce in July 2007. He is currently unmarried. He and \nhis former wife have two daughters, ages 23 and 18. Applicant continues to provide \nsupport for his 18-year-old daughter, who is attending her senior year in high school. \nWhen she graduates, his support obligation ends. Tr. 25-26.  \n \nThe SOR alleges a total of ten debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.j.) Apart from three tax \nliens (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.g.) and a foreclosure judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f.), the remaining \nsix debts alleged in the SOR consist of collection/charged off accounts owing \napproximately $17,340. The alleged debts are supported by the government\u2019s evidence \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions. Response to SOR, GE 2, GE 5. Applicant provided \ndocumentation that the tax lien owed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. had been paid. Response to SOR, \nAE E. The debt reflected in the foreclosure judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) was satisfied by the \nforeclosure sale. Tr. 66-73. GE 2, AE K. \n \nApplicant has paid or settled the debts reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., and 1.h. AE N, \nAE O. He has addressed debts reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.i., and 1.j. by seeking \nthe services of a debt management company and has established a debt consolidation \nplan. He has established a monthly payment plan to the debt management company \nwhich is paid by direct debit from his bank account. AE Q, AE S. With regard to the \nremaining tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.g., Applicant has contacted the \nInternal Revenue Service and resolved his tax problems by filing his returns and/or \nsetting up a payment plan. AE P, AE R.  \n \n\n \n \n3\n                                                          \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to the loss of his job in 2002, and a \ncostly separation and divorce which spanned a six-year period. Applicant testified that \nthe majority of the charge accounts were attributable to his former wife. Additionally, his \nformer wife quit her job in 2001 and withdrew the funds from her 401k account, leaving \nhim with her tax liability as a result of early withdrawal. Tr. 96-97 \n  \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $57,672. His monthly budget reflects a net remainder \nof $831 after all his monthly bills are paid. Tr. 102, AE N. \n \nA supervisor from Applicant\u2019s company testified on his behalf. The supervisor \nholds a top secret clearance and described Applicant as a very good employee, who \ncan be trusted and counted on to perform whatever duties are assigned. He \nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance. Tr. 108-114. \n \nApplicant submitted two reference letters from two work-related supervisory \npersonnel. These letters described Applicant as \u201cvery security conscious,\u201d \u201cfirst to \nvolunteer for additional work,\u201d \u201cfirst-class professional,\u201d \u201cperformance has been \noutstanding,\u201d \u201cwill do what it takes to get the job done,\u201d and possesses \u201cintegrity\u201d and \n\u201cpatriotism.\u201d Both supervisory personnel recommended Applicant for a security \nclearance.AE B, AE C. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the \nDisqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to \nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as \ninflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. Each decision \nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in \nSection 6.3 of the Directive,1 and the whole person concept.2 Having considered the \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is the \napplicable relevant adjudicative guideline. \n \n \n \n1  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n             2  Directive \u00b6 2(a)  \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables \nknown as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person \nconcept includes the consideration of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. . . .\u201d \n \n\n \n \n4\n                                                          \nBurden of Proof \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 The government has the initial burden of proving \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must \nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.4 The responsibility then shifts to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of \npersuasion.5  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, \ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.6 \n \nConclusions \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),7 the government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to at \nleast 2002. Since then, he has accumulated ten debts, which were substantiated by the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence and discussed above. Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nCondition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 \n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; apply in this case. \n \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a \nscintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, \n2006) (Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n \n5  Egan, supra n.6, at 528, 531. \n \n6  See Id; Directive Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n7  Guidelines \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n \n5\n                                                          \nApplicant experienced a loss of income after losing his job in 2002, and \nundergoing a costly separation and divorce. The financial toll of this unexpected income \nloss and divorce-related costs placed Applicant in a precarious financial situation from \nwhich he is still recovering. These facts demonstrate circumstances beyond his control.  \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation demonstrating that he paid or resolved all of \nhis debts either by contacting the creditors directly or by retaining the services of a debt \nmanagement company. He has established realistic payment plans with all his creditors, \nand has remained current on those plans. His evidence reflects he has the resolve and \nwherewithal to pay down his debts.  \n \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,8 I conclude that two of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \nGuidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; apply in this \ncase.  \n \nHe presented evidence showing he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations as demonstrated by contacting his creditors and resolving his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence sustains a finding that he is financially responsible and has taken \ncontrol of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems \nare not likely to be a concern in the future.   \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the \nwhole person concept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, his maturity, \nhis years of working for a defense contractor, work performance, commitment to his \nfamily, and his demeanor and conduct during his hearing. Considering the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances, he demonstrated sufficient judgment and trustworthiness in \nthe handling of his financial affairs. In short, he has mitigated the security concerns \nraised.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 18, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on January 28, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 28, 2008, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 13 exhibits.\nMarch 26, 2008\n\n2\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on February 4, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\n         At the outset of the hearing, Applicant confirmed her waiver of the 15-day written\nnotice requirement in the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive.  The 15-day\nwritten notice requirement was, accordingly, waived. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her payments of several of her medical and consumer\ncreditors and confirmation of her employment status.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted 10 days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with documented payments and payment acknowledgments.\nHer post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant accumulated six debts exceeding $11,000.00.\nUnder Guideline E, she allegedly understated her debts over 180 days delinquent and\nomitted debts over 90 days delinquent in completing a security clearance application in\nNovember 2006.  In her response, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covering\ndebts without explanation, but denied falsifying her security clearance application.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old custodian for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in November 1999 and has two daughters (ages 25 and 27) by\na man who is not her husband (R.T., at 40-41).  The youngest daughter lives with\nApplicant. Because this daughter is currently between jobs, Applicant provides her\nfinancial support.  Applicant separated in 2005 and divorced him in August 2006.  Her\nex-spouse provides no financial support of any kind or form.\nApplicant lost her job in 2003 and was unemployed for about eight months (R.T.,\nat 38).  She experienced serious medical issues (a blood condition) in March 2006\n(before her divorce was final), and was hospitalized for five days (R.T., at 39).  Without\nany medical insurance of her own, and legally separated from her husband, Applicant\nincurred major medical bills.  Her estranged husband declined to pay not only\nApplicant\u2019s medical bills (creditors 1.d and 1.f), but her consumer credit card and\nfurniture accounts as well (creditors 1.a, 1.b and 1.e).   As a result, these accounts\nbecame delinquent. Altogether, Applicant\u2019s listed delinquent accounts exceed\n\n3\n$11,000.00.  These listed debts include her listed past due medical debt (creditor 1.d),\nwhich currently approximates $16,241.45 (R.T., at 62-64). \nApplicant has sought no formal counseling regarding her finances.  She\nestimates she nets $1,381.00 from the two jobs she currently holds, and estimates her\nmonthly expenses (inclusive of her car payment, rent, insurance, food and utilities, gas\nand church tithing) total approximately $1,495.00 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 99).  This leaves a\nmonthly negative remainder of around $114.00.  She assures, though, that she is\npaying her bills every month, and will find the way to satisfy her agreed monthly\npayments on her old debts with the resources she currently has available (R.T., at 99-\n100). \nBased on Applicant\u2019s latest employment verification (see ex. T), she grosses\naround $1,561.00 just from her janitorial services work with her defense contractor, and\nwith her additional employment can be expected to produce a higher gross monthly\nincome.  Because she did not provide any updated budget that reflects her combined\nincome and expenses, though, it remains a little unclear how she will be able to manage\nher current monthly expenses and the additional debt payments she has committed to.\nApplicant is able to document her payment arrangements with several listed\ncreditors.  She corroborates her $50.00 monthly payment arrangement with creditor 1.a\nwith $50.00 payments for the months of November and December 2007 (see exs. A and\nN; R.T., at 43-50).  She has a settlement agreement, too, with creditor 1.b (see exs. B\nand O; R.T., at 54-55) and creditor 1.d (see exs. D and P).  She had agreed to monthly\npayments on this debt of $25.00 a month, beginning in September 2007.  Under her\nnew payment arrangements she is required to make $100.00 monthly payments (R.T.,\nat 64-68).  This payment arrangement represents a considerable increase over the\nmodest agreement (i.e., $25.00 a month) she previously arranged with the creditor back\nin August 2007. \nWhile Applicant could not initially identify creditor 1.f (R.T., at 70-72), she later\nmade contact with the creditor and identified it as one of her medical debts.\nSubsequently, she entered into a payment arrangement with the creditor on a currently\nstated balance of $1,941.68.  Her payment arrangements call for her to make small\n$20.00 monthly payments on this debt (see ex. Q).  She documents making the\nscheduled initial monthly payment on this debt in February 2008 (ex. Q).  \nApplicant has paid off the remaining debts covered in the SOR.  She documents\nsatisfaction of her creditor 1.c debt with a letter from the creditor\u2019s customer service in\nJanuary 2008 (see exs. C and R).  She paid the remaining balance owed ($560.96) on\na furniture account (creditor 1.e) and received a letter from the creditor\u2019s collection\nagent in February 2008, confirming payment in full of the account (see ex. S)\nApplicant is highly regarded by her co-workers and friends, who describe her as\na very trustworthy, dependable, and responsible worker (see ex. M).  She is\ncharacterized as a person of faith with strong moral ethics.  Friends who have known\n\n4\nher for many years value her for her integrity and honesty, and consistent placement  of\nthe needs of her children and grandchildren above her own (ex. M).  \nAsked to complete a security clearance application (e-qip) in November 2006,\nApplicant answered yes to question 28A (inquiring about debts over180 days\ndelinquent) and listed her creditor 1.b debt.  However, she omitted the remaining five\ndebts listed in the SOR.  Responding to question 28B (asking about debts over 90 days\ndelinquent) of the same e-qip, she answered in the negative (ex. 1).  She assures she\nincluded her delinquent debts when answering the handwritten security clearance\napplication initially provided her and attributes her understated debts covered by\nquestion 28A and fully omitted debts covered by question 28B, respectively, to\nconfusion and mistake in filling out the electronic questionnaire (R.T., at 87-89).  At the\ntime she first applied for her current job, she was not told she needed a clearance and\nhad no reason to conceal her debts (R.T., at 89). \nSeveral months after completing her e-qip, Applicant was interviewed by an\nagent from OPM.  When asked by the interviewing agent, she provided full and\ncomplete answers to the investigator without any apparent prompting (R.T., at 109-110).\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s overall reputation for honesty and prompt, voluntary corrections\nwhen asked in her scheduled interview, her explanations may be accepted as both\nplausible and credible. Inferences warrant that Applicant\u2019s initial omissions were not\ndeliberate, and not made with any intent to intentionally mislead the Government.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\n\n5\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a janitorial services employee for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts (both medical and consumer-related) over a\n\n6\nfour-year period spanning 2003 to 2006.  Considered together, and without resolution,\nthey raise  security significant concerns.  Of initial security concern, too, are Applicant\u2019s\nomissions of delinquent debs in the security clearance application she completed.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and her past inability to address these identified\ndelinquent debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of\nthe Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d and DC 19\u00a9), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to income shortages following her loss\nof employment in 2003 and her ensuing separation in 2005.  With no support from her\nestranged spouse to address their joint debts that were created during the marriage,\nand no health insurance to cover her hospitalization in 2006, she incurred a significant\nmedical debt, which she is still struggling to satisfy.  As a single parent of two\ndaughters (now adults) with no prior or current financial support from the biological\nfather, she has had to work two jobs just to defray the costs of her necessities. With a\nmonthly negative remainder, she has encountered considerable difficulties in\naddressing her old debts.  Just the same, she has managed to pay off several of her\nlisted debts (creditors 1.c and 1.e) and has worked out minimum payment\narrangements with her remaining creditors.  She assures she will be able to maintain\nher payment compliance with the terms of the various payment plans she has\ncompleted with her creditors.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with her\nsudden loss of marital income in 2003, her ensuing divorce, the lack of any financial\nsupport from either her estranged spouse or biological father of her two daughters, and\nthe limited resources that have been available to her to address her old debts,\nApplicant may rely on MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations.  Extenuating circumstances continue to adversely impact Applicant in\nher current efforts to resolve her accumulated debts.  \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her demonstrated\nextenuating circumstances, credible proofs of payment, age of the debts, and further\nevidence she has her current repayment plans under control with the resources\navailable to her. Resolution and repayment of these somewhat aged debts at issue are\n\n7\ncovered by three of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.  MC 20(a),\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability, while not dispositive.\nAnd both MC \u00a9), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nand MC (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts,\u201d have some applicability as well. \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTo be sure, the Appeal Board has expressed reservations against \u201celeventh\nhour\u201d resolutions of financial problems in the place of timely remedial actions.  See\nISCR Case No. 01-21030 (App. Bd. May 7, 2004).  But Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations\nin her situation were substantially extenuated and have been followed by demonstrated\ngood-faith efforts to repay her debts when she has been able to do so.\nSo, using a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations, her documented steps\ntaken to resolve them, and the responsibility and trustworthiness she is credited with in\nher work, church, and personal life as a struggling single parent, Applicant mitigates\nsecurity concerns related to her proven debt delinquencies.  Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through f of the\nSOR.\nApplicant\u2019s debt omissions in her e-qip\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented understated\nand omitted delinquent debts in the e-qip she completed in November 2006.  Her\nomissions of pertinent debts in the questions she answered (questions 28A and 28B)\nare, however, attributable to her mistaken reading of the questions in the electronic\nversion of the application she earlier completed in handwritten form. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\napplicant who has an outstanding reputation for honesty and trustworthiness among\nher friends and coworkers. She is of record, too, in promptly and voluntarily\nacknowledging all of her covered debts when first asked about them in her initial OPM\ninterview.  Applicant\u2019s overall reputation for honesty and trustworthiness and prompt\ngood-faith acknowledgment of her debts when asked about them help to reinforce the\n\n8\ncredibility of her claims she simply misread the pertinent  questions in her e-qip without\nany intention to falsify her answers.\nBoth Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations and prompt, good faith corrections of the\nomissions in her ensuing OPM interview enable her to take advantage of two of the\nmitigating conditions available under Guideline E: MC 17(a), \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts and MC 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or\nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d   Based on both her own explanations, her\noverall reputation for credibility, and her prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomissions in her e-qip, Applicant is able to successfully refute the allegations of\nfalsification in the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Applicant served about four and a half months in the U.S. military in 1976. He was discharged before his end of contract because he was young, immature, and incompatible with military service.1 Applicant had an extensive criminal record when he was younger. He is a recovering alcoholic and cocaine/heroin addict. He was arrested on ten occasions between 1978 and 1982, for offenses including assault, possession of marijuana, assault by cutting, rape, theft, malicious destruction of property, disorderly conduct, and probation violation. The assault by cutting charge involved him cutting someone with a knife in a bar fight. He was convicted on several occasions. Applicant candidly testified that he was under the influence and committed all the offenses for which he was charged, except the rape charge, which he vehemently denied. The rape arrest resulted from a false allegation and was dismissed without prosecution.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel \nThomas Coale, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn January 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 29, 2008, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 25, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nApril 7, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on April 2, 2008.  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a motion to amend the SOR on February 12, \n2008, by deleting SOR \u00b6 1.c, and by adding a new \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.l. \nApplicant responded to the motion on February 20, 2008, and admitted to all the factual \nallegations in the motion. Applicant did not object to the motion to amend and it was \ngranted. The motion is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I and Applicant\u2019s response is HE II.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR and in his response to the motion to amend, Applicant \nadmitted all the factual allegations in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was married and \ndivorced and is currently married. He has two children, ages 29 and 23. He did not \ncomplete high school. Applicant served about four and a half months in the U.S. military \nin 1976. He was discharged before his end of contract because he was young, \nimmature, and incompatible with military service.1  \n \n \nApplicant had an extensive criminal record when he was younger. He is a \nrecovering alcoholic and cocaine/heroin addict. He was arrested on ten occasions \nbetween 1978 and 1982, for offenses including assault, possession of marijuana, \nassault by cutting, rape, theft, malicious destruction of property, disorderly conduct, and \nprobation violation. The assault by cutting charge involved him cutting someone with a \nknife in a bar fight. He was convicted on several occasions. Applicant candidly testified \nthat he was under the influence and committed all the offenses for which he was \ncharged, except the rape charge, which he vehemently denied. The rape arrest resulted \nfrom a false allegation and was dismissed without prosecution. The police and court \nrecords pertaining to the rape arrest were formally expunged on December 28, 2007.2 \n \n \n \nIn about October 1986, while high on drugs, Applicant robbed a gas station mini-\nmart with a pocket knife. He was arrested, charged with robbery and robbery with a \ndeadly weapon, and convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to five years incarceration, \nwith three years suspended, and placed on three years supervised probation. He was \ncredited with approximately five months for time served awaiting trial and served an \nadditional 12 months of incarceration.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19-20, 30, 35; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 25, 39-46; GE 2, 3; AE C; HE II. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-23; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in about August 1988, for possession of cocaine and \nconspiracy to possess cocaine. He was on probation at the time. He pled guilty to \nattempted possession and received probation for a year. He appeared before the Judge \nfrom the robbery charge and was ordered to serve the three years that were suspended \nfor that charge. He was incarcerated more than two years, from 1989 through 1991. He \nhas not been arrested or charged since he was released from prison.4 \n \n \nWhile he was waiting trial for the probation violation, Applicant decided that he \nneeded to change his life. His father was an alcoholic and he wanted something better \nfor his son. He voluntarily entered a hospital for detoxification on December 2, 1988. He \nwas transferred to a drug and alcohol treatment facility in another state shortly \nthereafter. From that facility, he went to what was in essence a halfway house, where \nhe continued to receive treatment, but he was able to work during the day. He remained \nat that treatment house until May 1989, when he went to court and then immediately to \njail. Applicant has not had a drink of alcohol or used an illegal drug since before he \nentered the facility. He counts December 3, 1988 as his sobriety date because that is \nthe first day that he did not take any substance. He continues to be involved in a 12 step \nprogram at Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and he averages three meetings a week. He has \nbeen very active in sponsoring other people. He currently is sponsoring eight people \nand estimates that he has sponsored hundreds over the years.5 \n \n \nApplicant met a man that lived near him while he was in the drug and alcohol \ntreatment facility in another state. When Applicant returned to the halfway house in his \nstate, he contacted the man about obtaining a job. He helped Applicant find a job and a \ntrade in the building and installation area. Applicant learned a different trade while in \nprison and worked in that trade for about two months after he left prison. He then \ncontacted his friend and obtained his old job back in the installation profession. He has \nworked continuously in that trade ever since. He is now a foreman, supervising 12 to 15 \nworkers.6  \n \n \nApplicant married in 1992. He obtained custody of his youngest child after he \nwas released from prison, when his son was about nine years old. He and his wife \nraised this son. His son is currently serving in the U.S. military. His wife works as a \nsupervisor for the state in which they live. They own their home.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer certified that he has been with the company since 2001, \nand he is a very dependable employee. His neighbor of seven years wrote that \nApplicant is a great neighbor, a hard worker who takes care of his family, and he is \nresponsible and trustworthy.8 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 23-24, 28-29, 34, 46-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 21, 24-27, 32-34, 36, 47-52. \n \n6 Tr. at 27, 31. \n \n7 Tr. at 30, 38. \n \n8 AE A, B. \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted numerous times in the 1970s and 1980s. \nHis criminal history raises the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing his \ncriminal acts. AG \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable. He admitted committing all his crimes except \nfor the rape arrest. The rape charge was dismissed and his arrest record expunged. AG \n\u00b6 32(c) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant was drunk, high, or both, when he \ncommitted all his crimes. He voluntarily entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in \nDecember 1988, and has not had a drink or used illegal drugs since. He continues to be \nvery active in NA. He has not been arrested since he left prison in 1991. He is \n\n \n6 \n \nsuccessful in his trade and has risen to foreman, supervising 12 to 15 workers. He has \na loving and stable home life. Applicant is a model of successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) are applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal history was all \ndrug and alcohol related. He has not used either in almost 20 years and has not been \narrested since he left prison. Applicant is not a former alcoholic and addict; he is a \nrecovering alcoholic and addict and he continues to work at staying sober. He attends \non average three NA meetings per week and is sponsoring eight people. Applicant \nwould not have a security clearance based on the first 30 years of his life. The last 19 \nyears prove that he is someone who can be trusted.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nGovernment Exhibits 6 and 7.\n1\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 28, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record, and\nsubmitted documents for the Judge to consider.  He also filed a motion to suppress, requesting that\ntwo documents submitted by Department Counsel (credit reports) be excluded from the record.  The\nJudge denied Applicant\u2019s motion.  On April 25, 2008, after considering the written record,\nAdministrative Judge Shari Dam denied  Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge erred by denying\nApplicant\u2019s motion to suppress and by considering the two credit reports submitted by Department\nCounsel; (b)  whether Department Counsel acted improperly by not \u201cverifying\u201d the accuracy of the\ninformation contained in the credit reports and by omitting information favorable to Applicant, in\ndiminution of her responsibility to present the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d to the Judge; and (c) whether\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe gravamen of Applicant\u2019s assertion on appeal is that two credit reports submitted by\nDepartment Counsel  contained numerous substantive errors, were thus unreliable, and therefore\n1\nshould have been excluded from consideration by the Judge.  In the course of proffering his appeal\narguments, Applicant made various representations concerning the policies and practices of credit\nreporting agencies and proper reporting methods.  He also includes with his appeal brief a lengthy\nattachment which he claims is not being submitted as evidence, but as \u201csupporting information for\nverification of this statement.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s assertions about the credit reporting companies and his\nattachment constitute new evidence offered on appeal, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.   \n            Applicant contends that the two credit reports are replete with errors.  He claims these errors\ninvolve matters such as personal data as well as the status of various debts that are listed in the\nreports.  Applicant argues that because of these errors, the credit reports do not meet the\nrequirements for the business record exception under the Federal Rules of Evidence, even when\nthose rules are used as a general guide.  Thus, the reports should not have been admitted as evidence\nin the case.\nThe Judge has the authority to rule on evidentiary matters.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10.  Those\nrulings are subject to review to determine whether they are consistent with pertinent provisions of\nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.2, and whether they are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  The Board notes that any review of a Judge\u2019s evidentiary\nruling must take place in the context of the Directive\u2019s pronouncement that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence shall serve as a guide and that technical rules of evidence may be relaxed to permit the\n\ndevelopment of a full and complete record. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19.        \nIn terms of the issue of basic admissibility, Applicant bears the burden on appeal of\nestablishing that the indicia of reliability in the method of the promulgation of the record is lacking\nto the point that it cannot be accepted under the rules governing the business records exception to\nthe hearsay rule.  Neither below nor on appeal does Applicant establish that the documents were\nimproperly or irregularly produced, or produced in circumstances that would render their reliability\nsuspect.  Rather, Applicant simply makes uncorroborated and conclusory assertions that the\ndocuments contain inaccuracies.  Such claims, even if proved, would go to the weight the\ninformation in the documents should receive, rather than to the documents\u2019 admissibility.  A review\nof the Judge\u2019s decision reveals that the Judge engaged in a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the\nadmissibility issue and resolved it in a manner that was within her discretion.  The Board finds no\nerror in the Judge\u2019s admission of the documents into evidence.    \n    \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that Department Counsel acted improperly and unprofessionally by\nneglecting to verify the accuracy of the contents of the credit reports are without merit.  First,\nApplicant\u2019s arguments are based on the premise that the contents of the reports were largely\nerroneous, a proposition that Applicant fails to establish.  Moreover, credit reports are ordinary\nbusiness records which are routinely accepted in DOHA proceedings.  Department Counsel is\nentitled to rely on the evidence contained therein,  and is under no obligation to verify the accuracy\nof that evidence before presenting it.  Applicant is free, of course, to provide any evidence in his\npossession that speaks to the issue of the accuracy of the information contained in the reports.  \nApplicant also asserts that Department Counsel acted improperly by omitting from\nunspecified documents evidence favorable to Applicant.  This, Applicant argues, had the effect of\n\u201cskewing\u201d the whole-person concept that \u201c[c]ounsel is responsible in presenting to the court.\u201d  Aside\nfrom the fact that Applicant offers no proof for his claim and has not stated the claim with sufficient\nspecificity for the Board to effectively evaluate it, there is no affirmative duty on the part of\nDepartment Counsel to unilaterally submit evidence establishing the \u201cwhole-person.\u201d  Applicant has\nthe affirmative duty to present evidence on his behalf.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 (\u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d).  Absent a showing that Department\nCounsel did not provide adequate discovery or otherwise improperly withheld favorable evidence\nfrom Applicant to his detriment, Applicant\u2019s claim is without merit.\nImplicit in Applicant\u2019s appeal is the assertion that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by\nthe record evidence and is, therefore, arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  The Board has\nexamined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record evidence, and concludes that her findings of fact\nand conclusions are supported by substantial record evidence.  See Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1\n(Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record\u201d).  The Judge has drawn\na rational connection between the facts found and her ultimate adverse security clearance decision.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n\nof the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington\n\nTruck Lines, Inc. v.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 14, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing, attached \nexhibits (AE), and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nApril 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing. On February 5, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) containing eight Items, along with a Motion to Amend the Statement of \nReasons, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 8, 2008. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on February 15, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file \nobjections and submit additional information. On March 12, 2008, Applicant submitted \nadditional information and exhibits, along with a Motion to Amend the Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigation Request and a Motion to Suppress Evidence. On \nMarch 19, 2008, Department Counsel filed her Reply to Applicant\u2019s Motion to Suppress \nand objected to Applicant\u2019s additional submissions. On March 27, 2008, DOHA \nassigned the case to me. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend the SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel included in its FORM a Motion to Amend the SOR by \nadding an additional allegation to Paragraph 2 that states as follows:  \n \n \n2.b. You falsified material facts on a Questionnaire for National Security \n \nPositions, signed by you on June 30, 2006, when you answered \u201cNo\u201d in \n \nResponse to the following questions: \u201cSection 27: Your Financial Record \n-b. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any \nproperty repossessed for any reason?\u201d By answering \u201cNo\u201d to this \nquestion, you deliberately failed to disclose that you purchased a vehicle \nin March 2000, which was thereafter repossessed, in approximately 2004 \nor 2005, due to your inability to make payments. \n \n \nApplicant objected to the Amendment and denied the allegations, offering an \nexplanation in his Response to FORM, dated March 12, 2008. In accordance with the \nDirective E3.1.17, the Motion was timely filed and is based on evidence contained in the \nrecord. The Motion is granted. \n \nMotion to Amend the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Request  \n \n \nApplicant filed this Motion, along with his Response to the FORM. The substance \nof the Motion is a request to update Section 8: Citizenship of the e-QIP by notifying the \nGovernment that on March 10, 2008, he obtained a U.S. Passport. The Government did \nnot respond to the Motion; however, said Motion is not an appropriate pleading in this \nproceeding, and therefore is denied. But, Applicant\u2019s honest attempt to properly inform \nthe Government of pertinent information is appropriate evidence to consider under the \nWhole Person Analysis of this Decision.  \n \nMotion to Suppress Evidence \n \n \nApplicant seeks to suppress the introduction of two credit bureau reports (Items 6 \nand 7) and Department Counsel\u2019s written analysis of those reports.  Applicant relies on \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence as the basis for his argument, specifically the rules \npertaining to hearsay. Department Counsel cites DOHA\u2019s procedural rules and case law \nthat permit the admission of hearsay in these administrative proceedings.  According to \nDirective E3.1.19, \u201cThe Federal Rules of Evidence shall serve as a guide. Relevant and \nmaterial evidence may be received subject to rebuttal, and the technical rules of \nevidence may be relaxed, except as otherwise provided herein, to permit the \ndevelopment of a full and complete record.\u201d  Using the Business Records Exception \nnoted in Federal Rule 803(6) as a guide, the two credit bureau reports are admissible. \nThe reports were prepared in the regularly conducted course of business and provide \nsufficient reliability and necessity to meet the test of admissibility under the Directive. \nThe issues raised by Applicant go to the weight to be given to the evidence and not the \nadmissibility. Department Counsel\u2019s statements contained in the FORM and Reply to \nApplicant\u2019s Motions are arguments and not evidence. Applicant\u2019s Motion is denied.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 14, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.d, and 1.o of the SOR. He denied all other \nallegations and provided explanations. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and divorced. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in May 1994 \nand was honorably discharged in September 1997, as a disabled veteran. (Response to \nFORM). He held a Secret clearance while in the Army. (Item 5 at 34). After leaving \nmilitary service, he was unemployed from September 1997 to January 1998. He \nsubsequently worked in various positions, but experienced another period of \nunemployment from March 2001 to May 2001. In addition to working, he attended \ncollege and earned a Bachelor of Science in Ocean Engineering. In May 2006, he \nbegan working for a federal contractor. (Item 5). \n \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant filed an e-QIP.  In response to two questions under \nSection 28, regarding financial delinquencies, he disclosed that he had \u201cbeen over 180 \ndays delinquent\u201d on a debt, and \u201cover 90 days delinquent\u201d on a debt. He noted that the \n$8,000 debt became delinquent in approximately December 2001 and was owed to a \nspecific revolving credit card. He attributed the debt to the periods of unemployment and \nthe termination of a romantic engagement. (Item 5 at 35; Answer). In his Response to \nFORM, he claimed he entered a repayment plan with the creditor and was \u201cin good \nstanding.\u201d  He did not submit a copy of that plan or evidence that he had made \npayments in accordance with it. \n \n \nIn response to two questions under Section 27, regarding his financial record, \nApplicant did not disclose a judgment that was entered against him in February 2005 \nrelated to a repossessed automobile. In 2001, he voluntarily surrendered a car he \npurchased because he could not afford the payments. He agreed to make payments on \nthe loan, with the understanding that the surrender would not be recorded as \nrepossession. According to Applicant, the \u201creport of a repossession on the credit report \ninformation is a result of the court actions taken, in breach of contract\u201d of an agreement \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhe made with the creditor.  (Response to FORM at 8). Subsequently, the creditor \nobtained a judgment against him in February 2005 for non-payment. He did not disclose \nthe judgment because the legal notice was mailed to his parent\u2019s address where he \nlived before he began attending college and they did not forward it to him. \nConsequently, he never learned of the final judgment order until he began the security \nclearance process, or that the voluntary surrender of his vehicle was subsequently \nclassified as repossession. He began making monthly payments on that judgment in \nDecember 2007. (Answer; Response to FORM).   \n \n \nBased on a July 2006 and a July 2007 credit bureau reports (CBR), Paragraph 1 \nof the Amended SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts and one outstanding judgment. The \ntotal delinquent debt amount listed, excluding obvious duplicate debts, is approximately \n$44,000.  The status of those debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nAmount \nCreditor \nStatus \nExhibit \na. \n$99 \nMedical \nDenies debt; Unpaid \nItem 7 at 11; No \nsupporting \ndocuments \nwere \nprovided \nby \nApplicant \nb. \n$156 \nMedical \nPaid  12/13/2007 \n AE - B1 \nc. \n$1,342 \nDepartment store \nDisputed\u2013date unknown \nItem 6 \nd. \n$1,025 \nUtility \nPaid 3/3/08 \nResponse \nto \nFORM-AE \ne. \n$3,145 \nDepartment store \nDenies debt; claims paid \nItem 7 at 6; Item 6 \nat 2; No supporting \ndocuments \nprovided \nby \nApplicant \nf. \n$2,219 \nCharge card \nDisputed 11/15/2007 \nAE \u2013 F1 \ng. \n$4,437 \nDepartment store \nDuplicate of e. \nItem 6 at 2 \nh.  \n$754 \nTelephone \nAccount \nclosed; \n11/23/07 \nAE \u2013 H1 \nI. \n$753 \nTelephone \nSame creditor as in h. \nAE \u2013 H1 \nj. \n$22,000 \nRevolving charge \ncard \nDenies debt; attempted \n to contact creditor1 \nItem 6 at 1; Item 7 \nat \n10; \nNo \nsupporting \ndocuments \nwere \nprovided \n                                                          \n1 Applicant disclosed in his June 2006 e-QIP that he owed approximately $8,000 to a revolving credit card \ncompany. That debt was included in the July 2006 CBR and listed the amount as $8,448. (Item 7 at 6). \nAccording to the July 2007 CBR (which references the same account number, listed on the 2006 CBR), \nthe original debt was recorded as $8,448, but increased to $22,000, as alleged in the SOR. (Item 6 at 2).  \nApplicant argued in his Response to FORM that these referenced items are not related to the original \ncredit card debt, but offered no evidence to support his contention or explain the identical account \n\n \n5 \n \n \nj.(sic)  \n$1,342 \nDepartment store \nDuplicate of c \u2013 disputed Item 6 \nk. \n$257 \nTelephone \nDisputed 11/16/07 \nAE \u2013 K1 \nl. \n$459 \n---------- \nDenies  & disputes debt \nItem 6 at 1; Item 7 \nat 7; No supporting \ndocuments \nwere \nprovided \nm. \n$206 \nTelephone \nDisputed 11/15/07 \nAE  - M1 \nn. \n$931 \nTelephone \nDisputed 11/14/07 \nAE \u2013 N1 \no. \n$11,704 \n2/2005 Judgment \non \nrepossessed \ncar \nAdmits \ndebt; \nBegan \nmaking \nmonthly \npayments in 12/07; Paid \nto date: $1,500;  \n7 \nExhibits \nare \nattached \nto \nResponse \nto \nFORM \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant admitted that he owes approximately $12,900 in \ndelinquent debt, of which he has paid approximately $2,600. He asserted that he \nformally disputed about $25,600 of the debt, (which appears to include the revolving \ncharge card amount he previously admitted owing), but did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence to support those assertions. He provided documentation that he \ndisputed five debts, totaling about $5,000. Applicant began resolving his debts in \nNovember 2007. \n \n \nIn his Response to FORM, Applicant stated that he is gainfully employed and \nsuccessfully managing his finances. He has paid off other debts and is current with his \nliving expenses.  He claimed he has not incurred additional delinquent debts since the \nearly 2000\u2019s. He did not provide any documents to support his statements. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nnumbers, other than to argue that Department Counsel \u201challucinates\u201d when she asserts a connection \nbetween the accounts.  (Response to FORM at 4). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant was unable to satisfy debts that began accruing after two \nperiods of unemployment, some of which remain unresolved to the present day. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a \ncloser examination. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation. The guideline includes examples of conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nthe disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant asserted that the debts arose several years ago. However, some \nof them remain unresolved today and others were only recently resolved. Hence, the \nevidence does not support this mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant attributes his \nfinancial problems to two short periods of unemployment and a failed relationship, both \nof which were conditions beyond his control. As there is no documentary evidence to \nindicate that he attempted to manage his obligations during those periods of time, this \nmitigating condition has partial application. \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not present any substantial evidence \nthat he received credit counseling and/or that his financial problems are under control, \nas required under AG & 20(c). After receiving the SOR in October 2007, Applicant \nbegan paying three delinquent debts that he acknowledged were his financial \nobligations. While that is some evidence of good-faith, his dilatoriness in resolving \nfinancial obligations that have been outstanding for several years, warrants only partial \napplication of this condition. He produced documentation indicating that he disputed five \ndebts, sufficient to trigger AG & 20(e), which is applicable when \u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG & 20(f) is not applicable to the \nfacts in this case.    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n8 \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the Amended SOR that Applicant \nfalsified his answers to two questions under Section 27. Your Financial Record, \nbecause he omitted information about a prior judgment order and repossession of an \nautomobile. The Government contended that those omissions may raise a security \nconcern and be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged under AG \u00b6 16 in this \ncase is: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information about the judgment or \nrepossession. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \n \nApplicant explained that because he was unable to make payments on his car, \nhe voluntarily surrendered it to the creditor in 2001. Subsequently, the creditor obtained \na judgment against him in February 2005. He did not disclose the judgment in the June \n2006 e-QIP because he was unaware that it had been entered in 2005, as the legal \nnotice was mailed to his former home address and never forwarded to him. Nor was he \naware that the voluntary surrender was subsequently recorded as repossession. Given \nhis truthful and detailed disclosure about his delinquent financial matters under Section \n28, I find these explanations plausible. The omission of the information was negligent \nand not intentional. Hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. This \nGuideline is found in his favor. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 34 years old, who \nserved his country in the military service for four years, during which time he held a \nsecurity clearance. In an attempt to be forthright in disclosing requested information to \nthe Government, he recently notified the Department that in March 2008 he obtained a \nU.S. passport.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems seemingly began after he left the Army and \nencountered two short periods of unemployment and personal problems between 1997 \nand 1998, and in 2001. As a result of those setbacks, he started attending college and \nultimately earned his bachelor\u2019s degree.  \n \nApplicant has taken some affirmative steps to resolve his financial obligations. \nThe Amended SOR alleges that he owes approximately $44,000 in delinquent debts. \nHe admits owing about $12,900, has paid $2,600 on the amount owed, and has \ndisputed about $5,000 of the listed debts. Hence, he has resolved or is in the process of \nresolving about $18,000 of the total amount alleged to be delinquent. Although he \nvehemently denies owing monies on more than half of the debts remaining, he did not \nproduce any substantive evidence to support his claims that he is not responsible for \nthose debts. I am particularly puzzled by the absence of any evidence to document the \nresolution of the original $8,000 debt listed in the June 2006 e-QIP and delinquent since \nDecember 2001.  \n \nThe Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is not \nrequired to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has \nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).\u2019\u201d Without \nadditional proof that Applicant has resolved all of his outstanding delinquent debts, \nalong with an established budget and a track record of managing his finances, I am \nconcerned that similar problems may occur in the future. Although he raised interesting \narguments throughout his pleadings, he failed to carry his burden to produce evidence \nto substantiate his claims and denials, and to rebut or mitigate the concerns raised by \n\n \n10 \n \n \nthe Government. Consequently, I cannot conclude that he has taken \u201csignificant \nactions\u201d as noted in the said case and based on his exhibits. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d:   \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.h and 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j (sic) and 1.k:   \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m through 1.o:   \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on November 3, 2005. On September 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations for Applicant. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record on November 5, 2007. Department Counsel prepared a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 20, 2007.  The FORM was forwarded to \nApplicant on November 27, 2007.  He received the FORM on December 5, 2007. \nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any additional material.  He \ndid not respond to the FORM.  The FORM was forwarded to the hearing office on \nJanuary 28, 2008 and assigned to me on that same date. Based upon a review of the \nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 5, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1,d \u2013 1.h, 1.i, 1.j-1.l, and denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.i. (Item 5.)  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with the defense contractor since \nAugust 2005. He is married but has been separated since December 25, 2004. He has \none child and two stepchildren. (Item 6.)   \n \nOn November 3, 2005, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 6.) In response to the questions related to \nfinancial matters in Section 27 of the e-QIP, Applicant indicated that vehicle \nrepossession in the amount of $16,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a Chapter bankruptcy filed in \nDecember 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; see Items 7 at 2; Item 10; Item 11 at 1; and Item 12 at 1.); \na $240 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $170 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $326 phone bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $985 fuel bill (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $208 electric bill (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $2,417 bank \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and a $1,000 cell phone bill. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.)   \n \nIn the additional comments section, Appellant indicated that he moved to another \nstate in 2004 for new employment.  His wife stayed behind where he previously resided. \nShe did not pay any bills and had an affair.  He is in the process of getting a divorce and \ncatching up on unpaid medical bills. (Item 6.)  \n \nHis subsequent background investigation also revealed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nfiled in March 1990. (Item 8.)  There are two additional delinquent debts not listed on the \ne-QIP investigation; a $1,700 bank loan placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h; see Item 11 at \n2.); and a $5,718 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.i; see Item 7 at 4.). \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant reiterates that his financial problems are \nthe result of his estranged wife not using the money he sent her to pay their debts. His \nfirst priority is to complete his divorce and then pay his debts.  He indicates that \nalthough he was laid off five years ago, he held a security clearance for 15 years prior. \n(Item 3.) He filed for bankruptcy in November 2000 because he was informed that he \nwas being laid off.  He filed for bankruptcy in 1990 because he was told he was going to \nbe laid off, but it was later postponed. (Item 5.) In a previous personnel security \nquestionnaire, signed by the Applicant on June 6, 1990, he indicated that he filed for \nbankruptcy in 1990 due to his ex-wife\u2019s bills and car. (Item 9 at 5.) \n \nIn November 2000, Applicant was laid off. He was unemployed for one year. He \nhas been steadily employed since November 2001. (Item 6, Section 11.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant denies the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, the $13,797 automobile \nrepossession. He admits to being co-signer of the loan, but claims that his estranged \nwife had possession of the vehicle and neglected to make the payments. He also \ndenies the $5,718 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i because he does not recall the account. \n(Item 5.)  He provided proof that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1,k were paid.  (Item 5 \nat 3-4). Although he provided a receipt which he claims verifies payment for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, the receipt is partially obscured so you cannot determine who the \noriginal creditor is and whether the debt was paid. On its face, it appears to be a letter \nfrom a collection agency attempting to collect a debt as opposed to a settlement letter. \n(Item 5 at 5.) He provided no proof that he was attempting to resolve the remaining \ndebts alleged in the SOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n4 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. He has a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.  He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 1990 and December 2000. After \nhis second discharge, he incurred ten additional delinquent debts, an approximate total \nof $26,953.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has history of financial irresponsibility going back to 1990. Although he \nresolved three of the debts alleged in the SOR, he has taken no steps to resolve the \nremaining debts.  Even though he blames his estranged wife for not paying the debts, \nthe debts are in his name and he has the ultimate responsibility for paying his debts.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to the fact that \nApplicant is in the process of a divorce and that he was unemployed for one year from \nNovember 2000 to November 2001. However, it cannot be concluded that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Since November 2001, Applicant has had full-time \nemployment. Applicant states his estranged wife is responsible for the debts. This is not \nsufficient for FC MC \u00b6 20(b) to apply. While Applicant\u2019s ex-wife may have not paid the \nbills, the debts are in Applicant\u2019s name. He had a duty to take action to resolve these \naccounts. When he discovered that she did not pay the bills, he could have contacted \nhis creditors and provided a forwarding address to have the bills sent directly to him.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  Most of the delinquent debt remains unresolved and it is unlikely the debt \nwill be resolved in the near future.  There is nothing in the record evidence which states \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, and \n1.k. However, Applicant has taken no action to resolve his other delinquent accounts.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply.  Although Applicant denies the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.i, both debts are listed on his credit reports.  He provided no supporting evidence that \nthese debts are not his nor that he took any action to dispute the debt. He denies the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b61.c because he claims that although he was a co-signer on the \ncar loan, it was his wife\u2019s responsibility.  Regardless of what personal issues Applicant \nmay have with his estranged wife, he has an obligation to his creditors to pay his debts. \nWhen you sign as a co-signer on a loan, you become responsible for the debt if the \nprincipal signer defaults on the loan.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided no \ninformation about his work performance. While Applicant is in the process of a divorce, \nhe has an extensive history of financial problems dating to 1990. He has filed for \nbankruptcy two times and continues to encounter financial difficulties.  While he blames \nhis estranged wife for his financial problems, the accounts were in his name and he took \nno steps to resolve most of the accounts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of multiple unpaid delinquent debts (credit card accounts, phone bills, medical bills, and other consumer accounts) ranging from a low of $23 to a high of $4,310 for a total of about $16,000. Her Answer was mixed, but in essence she admits the debts, but 3 disputes the status as will be discussed below. Also, she provided an explanation for each debt. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for this company as a computer technician since April 2006. She is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. Applicant married in 1994, divorced in 2000, and married her current husband in 2004. She has two children, a daughter who is now 16 years old and a son who is now 14 years old. Applicant has received $200 per month in child support since the divorce was final in 2000. Applicant has lived in the same community since about 1997. While separated from her first husband, she decided to return to college to further her education to support her children.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 28, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJune 23, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The SOR has \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.bb, but mistakenly omits \u00b6 1.s. \n3\n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer was received on February 25, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on May 15, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of\nmultiple unpaid delinquent debts (credit card accounts, phone bills, medical bills, and\nother consumer accounts) ranging from a low of $23 to a high of $4,310 for a total of\nabout $16,000.  Her Answer was mixed, but in essence she admits the debts, but\n3\ndisputes the status as will be discussed below. Also, she provided an explanation for\neach debt. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established\nby substantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nthis company as a computer technician since April 2006. She is seeking to obtain an\nindustrial security clearance for the first time.  \nApplicant married in 1994, divorced in 2000, and married her current husband in\n2004. She has two children, a daughter who is now 16 years old and a son who is now\n14 years old. Applicant has received $200 per month in child support since the divorce\nwas final in 2000. \nApplicant has lived in the same community since about 1997. While separated\nfrom her first husband, she decided to return to college to further her education to\nsupport her children. She had previously  attended a community college and earned an\nassociate\u2019s degree in office administration. From August 1999 to May 2003, she\nattended a local state university and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business\nadministration. In addition to her studies, she worked as a customer service associate at\na large retail store from July 1999 to November 2004. She worked her way up to the\nposition of head cashier and the responsibilities that went with it. Applicant lived on\nlimited financial resources while attending school and working at the retail store. This\ncircumstance resulted in Applicant moving into public housing, and she also used credit\ncards to finance living expenses. \n\n3\nAfter she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree, she was unable to obtain an job in her\nchosen field of information technology (IT) due to lack of experience. So, in September\n2004 she took a job as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a local school. She earned about the\nsame as working at the retail store, but the job came with benefits. She worked at the\nschool until July 2005 when she secured an IT position as a computer lab technician in\nthe same school system. She worked there until she started her current employment as\na computer technician in April 2006. \nIn general, Applicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not\ndispute (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4). She described her actions to resolve the debts in her\nAnswer and hearing testimony (Tr. 29\u201349).

Her plan is to address these two accounts when she completes the current\nrepayment agreements (Tr. 56\u201357).

She and her\nhusband manage their money via a single joint checking account, and her husband has\nassumed primary responsibility for bill paying and is helping her pay bills on time and\nclean up her credit record (Tr. 66). Monthly rent and car payments are current as are\nstate and federal taxes (Tr. 67\u201369). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n6\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The multiple delinquent accounts described above\nare more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the\nsame facts and circumstances support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n19\n7\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.\n19\nThe six mitigating conditions are as follows: \nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe most pertinent MC to this case is MC 4\u2014good-faith effort to repay\u2014and it\napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor. She presented substantial evidence (both documentary\nevidence and credible testimony) to demonstrate an intent to clean up her financial\nhouse. As summarized in the table above: (1) she paid, settled, or resolved 18 debts;\n(2) she is now repaying 3 debts; (3) she will address the 2 unpaid accounts when the\nothers are paid; and (4) 4 accounts are duplicates. Her actions show a documented,\nmeasurable improvement to her overall financial condition. Also, it shows that Applicant\nis both determined and serious. Based on the evidence, it is likely she will pay off the\noutstanding debts in the near future. And it is important to note that Applicant took\naction on many of the accounts before the SOR was issued in January 2008, which\nfurther supports a conclusion of good-faith effort.  \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, Applicant struggled financially after\nher divorce while raising two children. To her credit, she worked hard, went back to\nschool and improved her job skills, and it appears she is now on a path toward career\nsuccess. She remarried a few years ago and her husband appears to be a stabilizing\n\n8\nfactor in her life. Although she did not present a perfect case in mitigation by paying off\nall the debts, she did present an adequate case in mitigation.  \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.bb:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 24, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

She indicated that she intended to resolve those debts by filing \nbankruptcy after she received her 2007 tax refund. She noted that she contacted a \ncredit counseling company in 2005, but did not enter into a repayment plan because \nshe could not afford the monthly payment. (Item 5).  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owes approximately $37,810 to fifteen creditors, \nincluding department stores, credit card companies, charged-off accounts, and bounced \nchecks. The SOR based those allegations on credit bureau reports (CBR) from January \n2007 and December 2007, which noted that her debts began accruing in 2003 and \ncontinued accruing up to the present. In her Answer, she admitted that she owed all of \nthose debts. She did not provide any evidence documenting that she paid or resolved \nany of those debts, or an explanation as to the reason she accumulated so many debts. \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose ten delinquent \ndebts on the January 2007 SF-85P. She denied the falsification allegations and \nexplained that she did not disclose the delinquent debts because she \u201cthought the \n[question] was speaking of school, business, car or personal loans.\u201d (Item 2). \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that she was fined for a moving violation in June 2001 in \nresponse to \u201cQuestion 16: Your Police Record\u201d on the SF-85P. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n4 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns, \ntwo of which may be pertinent to this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201can inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Based on two \nCBRs and her admissions, Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy debts that \nbegan accumulating in 2003. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in 2003 and continued into 2008. Because \nthe problems have been ongoing for at least five years and have remained unresolved, \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n Applicant did not provide any explanation addressing the underlying reasons for \nher financial difficulties; hence AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot apply. She did not submit any \ndocumentation that she received credit counseling or that her problems are under \ncontrol. Nor is there any evidence that she made a good-faith attempt to resolve any of \nthe debts or dispute them. AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(e) do not apply. There \nis no record evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f), nor was unexplained \naffluence alleged in the SOR.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is \nset out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged, in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR, that Applicant falsified her answer \nto a question on the SF-865P because she failed to disclose specific delinquent debts. \nThe Government contended that those omissions raise a trustworthy concern and are \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied those allegations. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time the omission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. \nBd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jun. 9, 2004). \n \nApplicant misunderstood the scope of Question 20 and apparently \nbecame confused as to the scope of the questions by the language in \nparenthesis after the question, to wit: \u201c(Include loans or obligations funded or \nguaranteed by the Federal Government.)\u201d She thought the question was limited \nto car, school, business or personal loans. She did not understand that the \nquestion inquired into any delinquent debts. After reviewing the entire question \nand noting that she disclosed a minor traffic violation in the SF-85P, I find that \nher misinterpretation is plausible and that she did not intentionally falsify her SF-\n85P. Hence, Paragraph 2 is found in her favor and it is not necessary to consider \nmitigating conditions under this guideline or further reference under the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d concept.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 25 years old. She \nstarted working for a federal contractor in January 2007. According to the record, her \ndelinquent debts began accumulating in 2003. At the time the SOR was filed, she owed \napproximately $37,810 to numerous creditors and still owes that amount. That is a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsignificant amount of indebtedness for a young woman, especially in light of the fact that \nmajority of the creditors are department stores, credit card companies and bounced \nchecks. Clearly, she has had difficulty managing her finances since she was 20 years \nold. Although she indicated that she intended to resolve her debt, albeit by filing \nbankruptcy, she did not present any evidence that she has done anything to resolve or \npay her financial obligations to-date. Until she establishes a solid budget and a track \nrecord of fiscal responsibility, similar instances of exercising poor judgment in her \nfinancial life are likely to recur.   \n    \nOverall, the record evidence leaves substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position at this time. For all these \nreasons, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising \nfrom her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 11, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\nMarch 6, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n3\n Id. \n4\n2\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 30, 2007, and indicated she did not wish\nto have a hearing. Her reply or answer consisted of her handwritten responses on the\nSOR and a one-page letter. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 8, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant January 11  and it was received\nth\nby her January 21 . Applicant did not reply to the FORM within the 30-day period\nst\nallowed for a reply. The case was assigned to me March 4, 2008. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nIn its FORM, the government included as an item of documentary evidence a\nsubject interview of Applicant (Exhibit 5). The interview was part of a report of\ninvestigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The ROI\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s subject interview was an unsworn declaration made in May\n2007. \nThe general rule is that a background ROI may not be received and considered\nby an administrative judge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be\n3\nreceived with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  \n4\nIn past cases, the government has included an ROI in its FORM without an\nattempt to authenticate it or offer some other method of getting the evidence to the trier\nof fact (for example, stipulation). The ROI was excluded from consideration in those\ncases. Here, the government authenticated the ROI through Applicant. In particular, in\nSeptember 2007, it issued an interrogatory to Applicant asking her to review the ROI\nand state if it accurately reflected the information she provided during the subject\ninterview (Exhibit 5). Applicant indicated it did not so far as the start date of her\nmarijuana use was off by one month. Otherwise, Applicant had no disagreement with\nthe contents of the ROI. Accordingly, without objections, the ROI is admitted as a\nbusiness record or a public record or both and it will be considered. \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant was involved with marijuana,\ncocaine, and opium. In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual\nallegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance from the Defense Department for the first time. \nApplicant attended college during 1999\u20132003. She was awarded a bachelor of\narts in international studies in May 2003. From July 2003 to September 2004, she\nworked as an assistant manager for a business services company. From October 2004\nto July 2006, she worked as a legal assistant for a law firm. She commenced her\ncurrent employment as a cost analyst in July 2006. The record is silent concerning\nApplicant\u2019s job performance as well as her knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform her\nwork. \nIn December 2006, Applicant completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit\n4). In response to the relevant questions, Applicant indicated that (1) she had illegally\nused controlled substances within the last seven years, and (2) she had been involved\nin the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving,\nor sale of controlled substances within the last seven years. In the explanation section,\nshe provided the following information about her illegal drug involvement:\n\u2022\nIn 2001\u20132006, she used marijuana occasionally starting in her sophomore year\nof college, but she had no intention to use it in the future.\n\u2022\nIn 2002\u20132003, she sold marijuana and often made a profit.\n\u2022\nIn 2002, she used cocaine a few times on an experimental basis.\n\u2022\nIn 2002, she used opium a few times on an experimental basis.  \nIn her subject interview of May 2007, she confirmed her use of marijuana,\ncocaine, and opium as detailed above (Exhibit 5). She indicated that she or her house\nmates purchased all three drugs. Concerning marijuana, she used it five times per week\nafter class during 2001\u20132003, but not during the volleyball season. After college in\n2004, she shared a marijuana cigarette about six times with a coworker and his spouse.\nAnd in 2005\u20132006, she and her house mates shared a marijuana cigarette twice a\nweek. She quit smoking marijuana in May 2006 because it was time to grow up. Also,\nshe stated that she had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. \nIn her October 2007 reply to the SOR, she admitted to the allegations of illegal\ndrug involvement. She stated that her past decisions were inexcusable and made\nwithout thinking of the future. She characterized her illegal drug involvement as part of\nher college experience, which \u201cwas a rebellious time - a time of self-destructiveness and\nself-indulgence,\u201d and she acknowledges her decisions and actions were less than wise.\nAlso, she repeated her intention to no longer use illegal drugs.  \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.5\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n6\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any\n7\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n9\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n10\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n11\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n12\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the drug involvement disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n18\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n16\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n17\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d18\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying:\n\u2022\n[A]ny drug abuse (see above definition); and \n\u2022\n[I]llegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug involvement raises a security concern because it calls\ninto question her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She was, at times, a regular\nmarijuana user smoking it as frequently as five times per week, and she sold it for profit.\nIn addition, her representation that her illegal drug involvement was part of her college\nexperience is not entirely accurate. The record evidence shows that it continued after\nshe finished college in 2003. Indeed, she continued using marijuana until approximately\nMay 2006, a few months before starting her employment with a defense contractor. \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and none\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor. The evidence in her favor is minimal. Given the dearth of\nfavorable information, the record evidence is insufficient to credit her with mitigation.\nAnd the record evidence is too skimpy to conclude that she presented a convincing\n\n6\ncase in reform and rehabilitation. Certainly, the clearly-consistent standard requires\nmore than self-serving statements made in reply to the SOR to meet the ultimate\nburden of persuasion, and the evidence in Applicant\u2019s favor is not sufficient.    \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the drug involvement security concern. Applicant did not meet her ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 6, 2009\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) (Item\n4), on October 6, 2004. On March 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) detailing the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F, J, and E for Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an undated response to the SOR (RSOR) in writing (Item 3), in\nwhich she requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn March 31, 2009, Department Counsel issued the Department's written case.\nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on\nApril 1, 2009, and in the FORM, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits\n(Items 1-10). There were erroneous statements in the FORM including: the Government\nissued an SOR on June 19, 2008, when it was actually issued on March 21, 2008, and it\nstated Applicant responded on March 21, 2008, when the copy of the ROSR in my file\nwas undated.  Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant submitted no additional response.\nThe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 18, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto sensitive information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. She seeks to occupy a position, designated ADP-I/II/III\nto support a defense contractor. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F- Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists 19 allegations (1.a. through 1.s.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  Applicant admitted 12 of these allegations.\nAll of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in\nthe SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,024. In Applicant\u2019s\nRSOR (Item 3), Applicant denied this allegation, stating that she paid this debt, but no\nevidence has been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid or\nresolved. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $141. In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my bankruptcy,\u201d but no evidence was\nintroduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been filed or that her debts have been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $50.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she \u201cnever received a bill about this debt,\u201d but no evidence has\nbeen introduced to establish that she has disputed this debt or any of this debt has been\npaid or resolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $126.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my bankruptcy,\u201d but no evidence was\n\n3\nintroduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been filed or that her debts have been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $74.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that this debt was not familiar to her, but no evidence has been\nintroduced to establish that she has disputed this debt or any of this debt has been paid\nor resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $71. In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she was not aware of this debt, but no evidence has been\nintroduced to establish that she has disputed this debt or any of this debt has been paid\nor resolved. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,334.

This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $50.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she \u201cnever received a bill about this debt.\u201d but no evidence has\nbeen introduced to establish that she has disputed this debt or any of this debt has been\npaid or resolved. \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $859.

This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $851 for a judgement\nentered against her.  In her RSOR, Applicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my\nbankruptcy\u201d, but no evidence was introduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been\nfiled or that her debts have been discharged in bankruptcy. \n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $435. In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my bankruptcy,\u201d but no evidence was\nintroduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been filed or that her debts have been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. \n1.l.

In her\nRSOR, Applicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my bankruptcy,\u201d but no evidence was\nintroduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been filed or that her debts have been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. \n1.q. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $160.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that this debt is \u201cpart of my bankruptcy,\u201d but no evidence was\nintroduced to establish that a bankruptcy has been filed or that her debts have been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. \n1.r. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $842.  In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she cannot recall this debt, but no evidence has been introduced\nto establish that she has disputed this debt or any of this debt has been paid or\nresolved. \n1.s. This allegation concerns subparagraphs 2.d. and 2.e., which will be reviewed\nbelow. \nIn reviewing the file, I saw no explanation for Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties other\nthan she is a single mother.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe SOR lists 5 allegations, regarding criminal conduct under Adjudicative\nGuideline J. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n2.a. In 1994, Applicant was arrested and she ultimately plead guilty to Battery.\nShe was sentenced to serve 2 days in jail and 36 months probation. \n2.b.  In 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Battery and (2) Failure\nto Pay.\n2.c. In 1997, Applicant was charged with (1) Battery on Person (2) Failure to\nAppear, and (3) Violation Probation.\n\n5\n2.d. In 2001, Applicant was charged with Fraud in obtaining Aid For Dependant\nChildren (AFDC). She plead Guilty and was placed on three years probation and was\nordered to pay restitution of $8,575 and to complete 300 hours of volunteer work. In\nDecember 2002, she was charged with probation violation and a warrant was issued for\nher arrest. Applicant has not paid the restitution that she was ordered by the court to\npay.\n2.e.  In 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Fugitive of Justice, (2)\nExpired Registration, (3) No Proof of Insurance, and (4) No Driver\u2019s License. Applicant\nspent two days in jail, and was fined $844, which she has not paid. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n3.a. Applicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P)\n(Item 4), on October 6, 2004. Question 20 asked, \u201cAre you now over 180 days\ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion, and she listed no debts. The Government alleges that Applicant should have\nincluded the debts listed in the SOR under paragraph 1. \nClearly these debts had been delinquent for more than 180 days when Applicant\ncompleted and executed the (SF 85P), and they should have been listed in response to\nquestion 22.b. In her RSOR, Applicant acknowledged that her answer was incorrect, but\nclaimed that she was not trying to hide anything, she just rushed through the questions\n(Item 4).  Considering the history and extent of overdue debts, I do not find that\nexplanation credible. \n3.b. Question 16. of Item 4 asked, \u201cin the last 7 years, have you been arrested\nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)?\u201d Applicant failed to list her 2003 arrest\nwhich has been reviewed in 2.e., above. In her RSOR, Applicant acknowledged that her\nanswer was incorrect, but claimed that she was only thinking about the larger offense,\nwhich she included and has been reviewed under 2.d., above, at the time she\ncompleted Item 4. \nSince this arrest happened the year before she completed the questionnaire, and\nshe was in jail for two or three days for this incident, it is simply not believable that she\nwould not consider this event, when completing the application. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n6\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy her\ndebts, and her long history of not meeting her financial obligations.\n\n7\nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies, since no evidence was\nintroduced to establish that Applicant has resolved any of her overdue debts, While she\nclaims to plan to file for bankruptcy, there is no indication that she has done so or that\nher debts will be discharged if there is a bankruptcy filed. Finally, even if her debts are\nultimately discharged, there is no indication that she will not have financial difficulties in\nthe future.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as she was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses from\n1994 to 2003.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I can not find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is no\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, nor have I seen any evidence of sincere remorse.\nApplicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2, Guideline J is found against\nApplicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SF 85P that she executed on\nOctober 6, 2004.  Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the\nlast seven years prior to her completing the SF 85P, when clearly she should have\nidentified the debts listed on the SOR. I find that Applicant\u2019s explanation that she rushed\nthrough the answers, as the reason for her failure to put the Government on notice that\nshe had financial difficulties, is not sufficient or credible to consider it as mitigation.\n       Applicant also failed to correctly list her 2003 arrest on the SF 85P, and her\nexplanation for this failure is also not credible. \n      \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to sensitive information. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history, my\ninability to see the Applicant and judge her veracity in person, and the lack of any\nwitness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no reasonable\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information to the\nGovernment on the SF 85P, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly\nfailed to give complete, honest information to the Government. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16. (a) applies\nbecause Applicant deliberately provided false and misleading information to the\nGovernment in her SF 85P.  No Mitigating Condition applies under this Guideline.  As a\n\n8\nresult of the misinformation that Applicant knowingly provided to the Government, her\nlong overdue debts, and her criminal conduct, I find that Applicant has exhibited\nquestionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F, J, and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties,\nher failure to resolve the overdue debts,  her willful omissions made to the Government,\nand her criminal conduct, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a sensitive position,\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through s.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated November 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 48 years old, born in Egypt, married and divorced from an Egyptian woman, who is presently in an Egyptian jail on corruption charges. Applicant\u2019s former wife filed 22 legal cases against him in Egypt to harass him, and prevented him for six years from obtaining possession of the apartment his father bought for them when they were first married. Applicant is now married to an American woman he met on one of his previous trips to the United States. They married in Egypt in 2001. Applicant immigrated in July 2001. He returned to Egypt in early September 2001, to bring his two children, now 19 and 17 years old, to the United States. Applicant\u2019s former wife has almost no contact with the children in the United States, and they have no desire to return to Egypt to see their mother.

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 26, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 27,\n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 14, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on December 17, 2007.  DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on December 17, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January\nMarch 13, 2008\n\n2\n8, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified, witnesses testified on his behalf, and he submitted\nExhibits A through K, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on January 29, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Egypt and Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 20)  The request and the\nattached documents were admitted into evidence and included in the record as Hearing\nExhibit 4. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 48 years old, born in Egypt, married and divorced from an Egyptian\nwoman, who is presently in an Egyptian jail on corruption charges.  Applicant\u2019s former\nwife filed 22 legal cases against him in Egypt to harass him, and prevented him for six\nyears from obtaining possession of the apartment his father bought for them when they\nwere first married.  Applicant is now married to an American woman he met on one of\nhis previous trips to the United States.  They married in Egypt in 2001.  Applicant\nimmigrated in July 2001.  He returned to Egypt in early September 2001, to bring his\ntwo children, now 19 and 17 years old, to the United States.  Applicant\u2019s former wife has\nalmost no contact with the children in the United States, and they have no desire to\nreturn to Egypt to see their mother.  The 19-year-old son was born in the United States\non one of Applicant\u2019s previous trips to the United States for academic purposes.\nApplicant became a naturalized United States citizen in December 2006.  (Tr. 15, 38,\n40-57, 62, 64, 103; Exhibits 1, 2, 3, A; Answer)\nApplicant had an Egyptian passport when he traveled to the United States from\n1981 to 2001 for various academic studies, including doctorate work in his scientific\nspeciality field.  He used it to immigrate to the United States in 2001.  He destroyed the\nEgyptian passport on December 17, 2007, in the presence of his corporate security\nofficer by tearing the pages from the document and shredding them.  Applicant believed\nhe renounced his Egyptian citizenship when he took the oath of U.S. citizenship in\n2006.  He is willing to renounce again his Egyptian citizenship.  (Tr. 15, 38, 40, 41, 62, ,\n84; Exhibits 2, 3, 5; Answer)\nApplicant has no intention of returning to Egypt at any time.  He has not traveled\nto Egypt since coming to the United States in 2001.  Applicant does not want to return to\n\n3\nEgypt, prefers the United States, and wants to build a new life for himself in the United\nStates.  He wanted to come to the United States since he was 15 years old.  Applicant\nsaw what life was like in the United States over the twenty years he traveled to the\nUnited States for courses and as a visiting scholar, and wanted even more to move\nhere.  Applicant was a lecturer, assistant and then associate professor at an Egyptian\nuniversity from 1981, when he received his Ph.D. from an Egyptian university after\ndoing course work for the degree in the United States, under a cooperative arrangement\nbetween the two countries, until he departed Egypt in 2001.  Applicant\u2019s parents live in\nEgypt.  His father is 82 years old and ill with various ailments, including senility and\ndiabetes.  His mother is 68 years old, and also is ill with breast cancer.  Applicant\nspeaks to them on the telephone about twice a month, but admits he cannot take care\nof them, or do anything for them.  Applicant does not own property in Egypt, or\nanywhere outside of the United States.  Applicant has one brother who is a physician\nnow working in Saudi Arabia on contract.  The brother is doing so to make money, and\nthen will return to Egypt.  Applicant\u2019s contact with his brother is once or twice a year,\nbecause the brother is very busy in his medical work, and does not use the internet.\nApplicant also had some uncles who immigrated to the United States in 1967, and\nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 13, 30, 41-43, 53; Exhibits 1-3, A, K; Answer)\nApplicant is a scientist who speaks Arabic.  He has never had a security\nclearance in the United States.  He is offered a job with a defense contract reading\nscientific texts in Arabic and interpreting them.  (Tr. 26, 36; Exhibits 2, 3, A)\nApplicant is highly regarded by his wife\u2019s parents as a good husband and parent\nto his wife\u2019s two children, and to Applicant\u2019s two children.  His supervisors and\ncolleagues rate him as enthusiastic, honest, serious, and hard-working. (Tr. 66-100;\nExhibits G-J)\nI take administrative notice of these facts concerning Egypt:  Egypt has been an\norganized country for about 5,000 years.  The Arab Republic of Egypt is the most\npopulous country in the Arab world, with nearly 79 million people.  Life expectancy is 71\nyears.  It is a republic with a growing economy and a strong executive in its government.\nThere is also an elected Parliament with some members appointed by the President of\nthe Republic.  It has an appointed judiciary.  Egypt and the United States enjoy a strong\nand friendly relationship based on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and\nstability, strengthening trade relations, and promoting regional security.  However, the\nterrorist threat remains high in Egypt despite its pursuit of terrorists.  According to the\n2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States, terrorists use overt,\ncovert, and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine U. S. national security\ninterests.  Terrorist organizations currently target the United States for intelligence\ncollection through human espionage and by other means.  Egypt\u2019s human rights record\nis poor and serious abuses continue in many areas.  Torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged\ndetention, poor prison conditions, denial of fair trial and lack of due process, executive\nbranch limits on an independent judiciary, political prisoners and detainees, and\nrestrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association are some of the\nproblem areas. \n\n4\nI also take administrative notice of these facts:  Saudi Arabia is a monarchy in the\nMiddle East.  It is ruled by one family.  There are no political parties or national\nelections.  There are significant human rights problems.  The religious police harass and\nabuse individuals to force them to comply with religious actions and customs.  However,\nSaudi Arabia and the United States share a common concern over regional security.\nThe United States relationship with Saudi Arabia was strained after the attacks on New\nYork and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001, because the overwhelming\nmajority of terrorists operating in those attacks were from Saudi Arabia.  There have\nbeen other terrorists attacks against United States citizens since 2001.  These attacks\nnecessitated the U.S. State Department to issue a travel warning for Saudi Arabia\nbecause of the terrorist activities targeted against U.S. citizens and interests.  Saudi\nArabia believes in fighting terrorism in its own country, has taken steps to curtail terrorist\nactivities within its borders, and has had some successes.  The United States and Saudi\nArabia have cooperated in countering certain terrorist activities.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nThe security concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b69 as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nUnder AG &10(a)1, a disqualifying condition that could raise security concerns\nunder these facts is \u201cthe possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d The evidence,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s admissions, is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying\ncondition.  Applicant had an Egyptian passport, which he used to travel to and from the\nUnited States between 1981 and 2001 for various academic courses.  The latest\nissuance of that passport was November 8, 2002.  That passport was due to expire on\nNovember 7, 2009.\nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualifying condition, the burden\nshifted to Applicant to rebut or mitigate the allegations.  Under AG \u00b611, there are six\npotential Mitigating Conditions (MC). There are two MC that are possibly applicable\nhere.  \u00b611(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d\nand \u00b611 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d pertain to the situation in which an Applicant has\nforeign citizenship and a foreign passport while seeking a clearance.\n Applicant testified he thought he renounced his Egyptian citizenship when he\nbecame a U.S. citizen in December 2006.  Applicant expressed a willingness to do so\nagain to remove any doubt that it had been done.  \n\n6\nMC \u00b611(e) requires the passport be destroyed or invalidated before the\nGovernment considers granting the security clearance.   On December 17, 2007,\nApplicant destroyed his Egyptian passport by tearing the pages out of the passport and\nshredding them in the presence of a corporate security officer.  Therefore, both\nmitigating conditions prevail under this guideline.\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG \u00b66: under this guideline is as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b67 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, two of which\nmay be disqualifying in this case: (a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d and (b)\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information.\u201d\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not,\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in\na foreign country and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is\nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information.  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd.\nFeb.15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother are citizens of Egypt and reside there.  Presently,\nhis brother works in Saudi Arabia as a physician.   He has telephone contact with his\nparents.  He only speaks with his brother about twice a year.\nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions,\nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Two Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b68 are potentially\nmitigating. \n\n7\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the\nforeign individual and the interests of the U.S.);\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person is so minimal, or the individual\nhas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interests); and, \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation);\nApplicant established application of \u00b68(a) and \u00b68(c).  From the evidence at the\nhearing, there is little risk of Applicant being placed in a position to be coerced, and\nthere is no conflict of interest situation in which Applicant could be placed because of\nhis relationships with his parents and brother.  Egypt and the United States, and Saudi\nArabia and the United States, are allies and have strong friendly relations based on\nmutual interests of Middle East peace and stability.  Applicant\u2019s father has senility and is\nretired from his private business.  He is 82 years old in a country where life expectancy\nis 71 years of age.  Applicant\u2019s mother is 68 and ill.  His contact is limited to periodic\ntelephone calls. His brother is a non-political physician who works in Saudi Arabia\nbecause the pay is better there than in Egypt for his profession.  Applicant has limited\ncontact with him.  His familial contacts are so infrequent that there is no risk in them for\nApplicant to be the object of foreign influence or exploitation by Egypt or Saudi Arabia.\nApplicant established application of \u00b68(b).  Based on his relationship and loyalty\nto the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest.  Applicant expressed repeatedly and forcefully that he loves the United\nStates and had wanted to move here for at least 20 years.  He spent much time since\n1981 in the United States studying and working with U.S. scientists.  The unhappy\ncollapse of his first marriage, and the desire to get his children out of Egypt, coupled\nwith his marriage to a U.S. citizen in 2001, convince me his loyalties and attachments\nare to the United States.  He has not returned to Egypt since he came to the United\nStates in 2001, and has no intention of traveling back there.  It is unlikely that he will be\nplaced in a compromising position between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n8\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s strong attachment to the\nUnited States, his long standing desire to live here, and his 2006 naturalization\ndemonstrate that his \u201cwhole person\u201d is focused on building a life for himself in the\nUnited States.  He has effectively renounced all association with Egypt, and he never\nhad any with Saudi Arabia.  He has not returned to Egypt, and he rather forcefully\ndeclared he would not travel there in the future.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign preference,\nforeign influence security concerns.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on December 11, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on March 10, 2008, and the hearing was held on April 16,\n2008. Based on a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility of security clearance access is granted. \nJune 17, 2008\n\n Applicant\u2019s wife was born in the U.S. in March 1958. After spending several years as a professor and\n1\nadministrator at a local university, she is devoting her efforts to raising their two children. \n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted four exhibits (GE). Administrative\nNotice was taken of four documents generated by the United States (U.S.) Department\nof State regarding the government of Morocco and its relationship with the U.S., the\ngovernment\u2019s human rights record, and the status of anti-government terrorist activity in\nthe country. At the hearing, testimony was taken from Applicant and three witnesses.\nFollowing the hearing, Applicant submitted character exhibits, e.g., cash awards,\nperformance awards,  relating to his job performance. (AE C through AE E) DOHA\nreceived the transcript on April 24, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that, based on a Moroccan identification card,\nApplicant has a preference for Morocco over the U.S. In paragraph 2, the SOR alleges\nApplicant\u2019s ties and travel to Morocco raise foreign influence concerns. \nApplicant is 47 years old, married with two children, 14 and eight. He has been\nemployed as a library assistant with a defense contractor since March 2005. He seeks a\nsecret security clearance.\nBorn in Morocco in December 1962, Applicant received his Bachelors of Arts\ndegree in May 1986, while working in Morocco as a librarian for the U.S. Peace Corps\nbetween 1981 and 1988. He met his future wife, an American citizen,  who was also\n1\nworking in the country as a Peace Corps volunteer. \nIn 1988, Applicant (26 years old) was awarded a very prestigious scholarship to\nattend a two-year Master\u2019s degree in information and library science in the U.S. He\nimmigrated to the U.S. to begin the two-year program.

Applicant received his\nAmerican citizenship in October 1997, and a U.S. passport a month later. Applicant\u2019s\nsecond child was born in 2000. In April 2005, Applicant began working for his current\nemployer as a library assistant. \nForeign Preference\nThe foreign preference allegation was included in the SOR based on Applicant\u2019s\npossession of an expired Moroccan National Identity Card (ID card) that was issued in\n1993 (SOR 1.a.), with an expiration date in 2003. (GE 2) Applicant indicated during the\nhearing that when traveling to Morocco, he carried his ID card for the purposes of\n\n She explained that her familiarity with the immigration documents came from her Peace Corps volunteer\n2\nexperience in Morocco, and the family\u2019s travel in and out of the country since then. (Tr. 142)\n3\nassisting the Moroccan immigration officials identify him, and to alert them about\nwhether he had a criminal history. Applicant noted that simply reciting the ID number\n(without the card) was sufficient for the immigration officials to conduct their check. The\nlast time he traveled to Morocco, he forgot his ID card, and the Morocco officials let him\ninto the country anyway, because they recognized him. \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship, Applicant believed he had renounced his\nMoroccan citizenship in October 1997 when he took the naturalization oath to become a\nU.S. citizen. (Tr. 87) He testified that he was willing to surrender his Moroccan passport\n(that expired in 1998), and also the ID card (that expired in 2003). (Tr. 88)\nAlso during his testimony about his willingness to renounce his Moroccan ID card\nand passport, Applicant described a third identification document he was familiar with,\nbut never had possession of. He called the document a \u201ccivil status card\u201d he believed\nevery Moroccan citizen was required to carry. Applicant\u2019s wife  explained the status\n2\ncard grants foreign born children of native-born Moroccan fathers the option of being\nregistered by their father as Moroccan, so they become eligible for free education\nthrough college. Applicant\u2019s wife advised that they he could have applied for the status\ncard, and hence, the educational benefits, but declined. Applicant\u2019s wife compared the\nMoroccan ID card to a U.S. Social Security card that is used by the U.S. government for\nidentification. \nFollowing the hearing on April 21, 2008, Applicant advised his facility security\nofficer (FSO) by letter (AE C2) that he was renouncing his citizenship. In support of his\naction, he was turning over his Moroccan passport and identity card. On April 22, 2008,\nthe FSO declared by letter that Applicant had turned over the two documents to him for\ndestruction. (AE C1)\nForeign Influence\nApplicant\u2019s parents (SOR 2.a.) are resident citizens of Morocco. His mother was\nborn in November 1938 and is 69 years old. She suffers from diabetes. She has\ndevoted her time to raising her children. Applicant speaks to her weekly by telephone.\nHe last visited her in September 2006. Applicant\u2019s father is 70 years old. He retired as\nan accountant after 40 years of service in the Morocco national security force in\napproximately 1998. Recently, he had open heart surgery. Applicant\u2019s father receives a\npension from the Moroccan government which his mother will inherit on his death.\nApplicant sends no money to any member of his family in Morocco. \nApplicant has five brothers and three sisters who are citizens of Morocco. Some\nhave moved out of the country. Applicant\u2019s oldest brother is 52 years old and a resident\ncitizen of Morocco. He is also a citizen of France, living with his wife. He is employed as\na social worker. Applicant talks to him about once a month, and sees him every three\n\n4\nyears. The next oldest brother, a resident citizen of Morocco, is 51. He is employed as a\ndesigner for an oil company, and a computer-aided map planner. Applicant talks to him\nonce a year, and sees him during his trips to Morocco. \nThe next oldest brother is 50 years old, a resident citizen of Morocco, and works\nas an accountant in the same office at a municipal agency that collects the garbage.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister works there too. Applicant does not consider him close. They\ntalk on the phone about once a year. \nApplicant\u2019s next oldest brother after Applicant is his 45-year-old brother. He is in\ncharge of the administrative tasks in managing a villa used by a former U.S.\nambassador in a nearby country. Applicant\u2019s 44 year old brother is a resident citizen of\nMorocco. He is also a citizen of France, and is married with two children. He is an\naccounting professor in French Polynesia (Tahiti). \nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is 49 years old, and a resident citizen of Morocco. As\nnoted earlier, she and her 50-year-old brother are employed by the same municipal\nagency that manages garbage collection. The next oldest sister, a resident citizen of\nMorocco, is 38 years old. She is a homemaker, and also operates a small boutique. His\nyoungest sister, is a citizen of Morocco, but is a resident of the U.S., applying for\npermanent resident status. She is employed as an office manager for a doctor.\nApplicant communicates with his sisters about once a year. \nApplicant has never had any connection with the Moroccan government or any\nother foreign government. Applicant has never worked or served for any foreign\ngovernment. In his three trips to Morocco to see his family in 2003, 2006, and 2007,\nApplicant always used his U.S. passport. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is aware that the family has property in Morocco, but does not\nknow about inheritance expectancy, as she and Applicant have not discussed the\nsubject. Applicant and his wife consider the net worth of their U.S. assets to be between\none and one and a half million dollars. Applicant\u2019s U.S. retirement account is\napproximately $12,000.00. \nCharacter Evidence\nThe Chief Executive Office (CEO) of Applicant\u2019s employer testified that Applicant\nwas hired in March 2005 because of his library and computer science background. The\nCEO has interfaced with Applicant regularly over a three-year period, and has found\nhim to be an honest person that consistently delivers a quality product. \nThe director of digital library solutions has known Applicant for about three years,\nand is his supervisor. His performance evaluations reflect superior ratings anchored by\na reliable job performance that has been rewarded by gift certificates and salary\nincreases on a periodic basis. (AE E) According to the director, Applicant never\n\n U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Background Note: Morocco, dated October 2007\n3\n(\u201cBackground Note\u201d), at 5 - 8.\n U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Specific Information on Morocco, December\n4\n14, 2007 (\u201cCountry Specific Information on Morocco\u201d), at 1. \n U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Country Reports on Human\n5\nRights Practices - 2006, Introduction and Report on Morocco, dated March 6, 2007.\n5\nexhibited any preference for any country except the U.S. The director knows Applicant\nhas a close relationship with his parents, and keeps in regular contact with them. \nThe digitization services director of Applicant\u2019s current employer has worked with\nApplicant on several projects. In demonstrating his professional expertise and\nappropriate handling of security matters, the director noted Applicant\u2019s successful\ncompletion of a sanitization project that protects sensitive information in the library\nsystem for one of the branches of the military. \nApplicant\u2019s former colleague and supervisor between 1995 and 2005 provided a\ncharacter statement extolling Applicant\u2019s expertise as an information librarian, and then\nas a systems manager for the entire occupational organization. In the supervisor\u2019s\nopinion, Applicant could be counted on to get the job done in a professional and timely\nmanner. The supervisor admired Applicant\u2019s attention for security rules and\nmanagement of sensitive documents.\nAdministrative Notice\n1. Morocco, a moderate, stable, democratic country, was the first country to seek\ndiplomatic relations with the U.S. in 1977, and enjoys continuing strong ties and good\nrelations with this country.3\n2. Before the terrorist bombings in Morocco in March and April 2007, the last time\nsimilar attacks occurred in the country was in 2003. While Moroccan authorities\ncontinue to break up groups seeking to attack western and Moroccan targets, the\npotential for terrorist violence remains high in the country.  Significantly, the potential for\n4\nsome type of terrorist violence occurring in the U.S. must constantly be monitored\ndespite the remarkable efforts of U.S. security personnel. \n3. Morocco has made commendable advancements in the area of human rights, but\nproblems remain such as arbitrary detention of citizens, and rare surveillance of foreign\ncitizens by Moroccan security personnel.  In the global war on terrorism, the U.S.\n5\ngovernment has taken similar types of action to keep our borders secure. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n6\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Preference (FP)\nWhen and individual acts in a manner that shows preference for a foreign country\nover the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions harmful\nto the U.S. \nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\n\n There was also extended testimony regarding a \u201ccivil status\u201d card. Applicant never accepted this potential\n6\nbenefit of preserving free Moroccan education for his children, and therefore, there was no indication of foreign\npreference. \n7\nforcing an applicant into a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \nAnalysis\nForeign Preference (FP)\n9. The Concern. \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the U.S., then he or she is prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.\u201d\nApplicant informed DOHA in September 2007 (GE 2) that he had a Moroccan ID\ncard issued to him in 1993 with an expiration date of 2003. Possessing an ID card\nexposes Applicant to foreign preference FP disqualifying condition (DC) 10.a. (exercise\nof any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member) Applicant became a U.S. citizen in\nOctober 1997. Continuing to maintain a valid ID card after becoming a U.S. citizen, with\nor without a Moroccan passport, is equivalent to providing a benefit to Applicant that he\nwas not entitled to after he became a U.S. citizen, and notwithstanding the assertion\nthat the ID card was used for administrative purposes.  \n6\nThe two mitigating conditions (MC) that are activated to resolve the FP guideline\nin Applicant\u2019s favor are (1) FP MC 11.b. (the individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship), and (2) FP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). Applicant\u2019s\ncredible statements of intention in the government exhibits and his testimony to\nrenounce his Moroccan citizenship are entitled to some weight. Applicant\u2019s documented\nactions under FP MC 11.e. in renouncing his Moroccan citizenship and turning over the\nID card and his expired Moroccan passport for destruction justify a resolution of the FP\nguideline in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nForeign Influence (FI)\n6. The Concern \u201cForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns where those\ncontacts and interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or induced by a\nforeign entity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign entity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign country where\nthe contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to whether the\nforeign government targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \n\n8\nThe government has established a preliminary basis for denying Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application. His mother and father are resident citizens of Morocco.\nThree of his five brothers are resident citizens of Morocco. The other two are citizens of\nMorocco but residents of other countries. One is a resident citizen of France, and the\nother is citizen of Tahiti. Two sisters are resident citizens of Morocco, and one is citizen\nof Morocco, but is living in the U.S. and applying for permanent resident status. Foreign\nInfluence (FI) DC 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion) applies.\nFI DC 7.b. (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information) applies. The fact that Applicants family\nmembers are still citizens of Morocco constitutes a potential for conflict that shifts the\nburden to Applicant to show why he will resolve the conflict in favor of the U.S.\nIn deciding the weight if any to be assigned to the mitigating conditions under the\nFI guideline, it is important to note that FI guideline is not just limited to countries hostile\nto the U.S. Friendly nations have targeted U.S. citizens for sensitive information,\nespecially in economic, scientific, and technical fields. See, ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 at 15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002) Also, when assessing an applicant\u2019s family ties\nto a foreign country, the totality of the family contacts must be considered rather than\neach contact by itself. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (Ap. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003) \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s mother was never an agent or employee of the Moroccan\ngovernment. She has successfully raised nine children. Applicant\u2019s father worked for the\nMoroccan security force for about 40 years. While the DOHA Appeal board has held\nthat an employee of a foreign government need not be employed in a position involving\nintelligence or other national security duties to be an agent (ISCR Case No. 02-29254 at\n5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004)), Applicant\u2019s father was an accountant, and 10 years\nremoved from the position by retirement. There is no evidence in the record that\nindicates the father, or any other listed family member employed in a government\ncapacity, was or is an agent of the Moroccan or any other government. \nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother is 53 years old. He is also a French citizen and\nemployed as a social worker. The record is silent as to whether he works for a public\nentity or a private entity. The second oldest brother is 50 years old and supervises a\ngarbage collection service for a municipality. Applicant\u2019s oldest sister is an accountant\nfor the same municipal agency. I seriously doubt whether either sibling serve in a\nclandestine position. The third oldest brother is employed by an oil drilling company as a\nmap designer. The fourth oldest brother after Applicant is the 43-year old who is a\nprofessor at a high school in Tahiti. The last brother manages a villa for a former\nambassador to Saudi Arabia. The record reflects this brother ensures all support\nservices for the villa are handled in an efficient manner. There is no evidence that he is\na part of any activity outside those described by Applicant and his wife. \nThe second oldest sister is 38 years old and operates a boutique that specializes\nin children\u2019s clothing. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister is living in the U.S., and is applying for\nher U.S. permanent resident card. Considering the geopolitical nature of the\ngovernment of Morocco, the positions of those persons in the country, it is unlikely that\nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the\nforeign entity and the U.S. In sum, Applicant receives some mitigation under FI MC 7.a.\nwith respect subparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. \nHaving weighed the entire record, I believe Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the\nU.S., including his family and his job, outweighs his relationships with his parents and\nsiblings who are residents and/or citizens of Morocco and other foreign countries. The\ncharacter witness testimony and statements of the CEO, and his current and former\nsupervisors indicate he will resolve any conflict in favor of the interests of the U.S., and\nconsistent with FI MC 8.b. SOR 2.a. and 2.b. are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFI MC 8.c. is inapplicable to this case. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents and\nsiblings are more than casual and not infrequent. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\n\n10\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant met his future wife while both\nwere working in Morocco for the U.S. Peace Corps in the early 1980s. In 1988,\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. with a scholarship to complete graduate studies in\nlibrary science. He married his wife in 1990, and they are in their 18  year of marriage.\nth\nIn 1994, his wife gave birth to their first child. Applicant has been gainfully and\ncontinuously employed in the U.S. since the early 1990s. Though he has never had a\nsecurity clearance, during his employment with the occupational foundation between\n1995 and 2005, his employer was clearly impressed by Applicant\u2019s understanding of the\nimportance of security rules and his responsible management of sensitive material. \nApplicant\u2019s trips to Morocco 2003, 2006, and 2007 have little security significance\nunder the FI guideline. He used his U.S. passport for those trips, and there is no\nevidence indicating he engaged in any inappropriate activity while in the country.\nSubparagraph 2.c. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s ties and connections to the U.S. have continually grown since his\nimmigration to the U.S. in 1988. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in October 1997, and\nstopped using his Moroccan passport a year later. In 2000. his wife gave birth to their\nsecond child. He and his wife purchased their home they still live in eight years later.\nThey estimate their current, net worth in U.S. assets to be between one million and one\nand a half million dollars. Applicant has about $12,000.00 in his U.S. retirement\naccount. Though his wife is not certain, Applicant believes he has no financial interests\nor assets in Morocco. Having evaluated the record under both guidelines in the context\nof the whole person model, Applicant\u2019s ties and connections to the U.S. are significant.\nHis willingness to renounce his Moroccan citizenship and actions taken to accomplish\nthat objective demonstrate Applicant\u2019s singular preference is for the U.S. Further, the\nstrong ties he has developed in the U.S. over the last 20 years, reinforce my confidence\nhe will ably resist and report any potential foreign influence by either coercive or non-\ncoercive means. The FP and FI guidelines are found for Applicant.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year-old president and chief executive officer of a defense subcontractor who applied for a security clearance in connection with his company\u2019s filing for a facility clearance. He admitted, with explanations, the truth of each factual allegation in the SOR. He was born and raised in the United Kingdom (U.K.). He moved to the United States (U.S.) in a business relocation in 1995. He and his wife both became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2004, because they had become very successful here and wanted to be U.S. citizens. They also retain their U.K. citizenship, but intend to reside in the U.S. for the rest of their lives. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 8, 13; AE A; Tr. at 20, 75, 87-88, 127.) Applicant\u2019s two grown daughters, one of whom is married with four children, and his sister are all citizens and residents of the U.K. None are now, or have ever been affiliated with or employed by the U.K. government. Applicant owns four residential properties in the U.K., one that he uses when he visits and his daughters both use, one that one of his daughters lives in, and two that are rental properties. The value of these four properties is approximately $14 million. He also has two U.K. bank accounts holding a total of about $100 thousand, for use in property management and during visits there.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Jeffrey Christianson, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the U.S. in 1995. He\nhas been very successful in business. He and his wife intend to live here permanently,\nand became citizens in 2004. He used his U.K. passport once in 2005 due to mistaken\ntravel arrangements by his staff. He has since surrendered it. He has close family and\nsubstantial property in the U.K., but deeper and more substantial ties to the U.S. Based\nupon thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n10, 2007. On January 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines C and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nJuly 25, 2008\n\n2\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 18, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on March 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 7, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 10, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to\nme on April 16, 2008. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on June 25, 2008. During scheduling discussions, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nrequested delay until that date to accommodate Applicant\u2019s schedule. The Government\noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Department\nCounsel did not submit any request for administrative notice, but Applicant\u2019s Counsel\ndid introduce the U.S. State Department Background Note on the United Kingdom.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, as did two other witnesses, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 7, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old president and chief executive officer of a defense\nsubcontractor who applied for a security clearance in connection with his company\u2019s\nfiling for a facility clearance. He admitted, with explanations, the truth of each factual\nallegation in the SOR. He was born and raised in the United Kingdom (U.K.). He moved\nto the United States (U.S.) in a business relocation in 1995. He and his wife both\nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens in 2004, because they had become very successful\nhere and wanted to be U.S. citizens. They also retain their U.K. citizenship, but intend to\nreside in the U.S. for the rest of their lives. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 8, 13; AE A; Tr. at 20, 75,\n87-88, 127.)\nApplicant\u2019s two grown daughters, one of whom is married with four children, and\nhis sister are all citizens and residents of the U.K. None are now, or have ever been\naffiliated with or employed by the U.K. government. Applicant owns four residential\nproperties in the U.K., one that he uses when he visits and his daughters both use, one\nthat one of his daughters lives in, and two that are rental properties. The value of these\nfour properties is approximately $14 million. He also has two U.K. bank accounts holding\na total of about $100 thousand, for use in property management and during visits there.\nApplicant and his wife also own two homes in the U.S. worth a total of about $4 million,\none of which is his primary residence. His company has been very successful, and his\nrecent annual compensation is about $1 million in cash and $4 million in stock options.\nHe owns about $12 million in his company\u2019s stock, and valued his total net worth at\nbetween $40 and $50 million. About 70% of his assets are in the U.S. His U.S.-based\nestate planning attorney recommended maintaining some assets in the U.K. to hedge\nagainst currency fluctuations, since his two daughters are his sole heirs and they intend\nto remain living in the U.K. (GE 2 at 4-6; Tr. at 91-100, 110-113, 120-121.)\n\n3\nApplicant travels frequently around the world. His company\u2019s European\noperations are headquartered in London, and more than 90% of his regular visits there\ninvolve both business and some time visiting family. He and his family are very close.\nSince obtaining it, he has only used his U.S. passport when entering and leaving the\nU.K. During a visit to the U.K. in 2006, he and his wife renewed their U.K. passports that\nwere due to expire in 2007. He never used this renewed passport, and on advice of his\ncompany\u2019s general counsel and Facility Security Officer (FSO), has surrendered it into\nthe FSO\u2019s custody because, with exceptions noted below, he has always traveled on his\nU.S. passport since obtaining citizenship, and intends to do so in the future. Any return\nof the passport to Applicant while he holds a security clearance will be documented by\nthe FSO in the JPAS system. His surrender of possession of his U.K. passport was\nconditioned on his receipt of, and continuing need for, a U.S. security clearance.\nHowever, since he will maintain dual citizenship, this is no different than having the\npassport physically destroyed since he could apply for a new one after his need for a\nclearance ends. He will not be able to use that passport for undocumented travel or\notherwise evidence a preference for U.K. citizenship. He testified, credibly, that his\npreference is for his U.S. citizenship. He is sincerely grateful for the financial and\nprofessional successes afforded him by the U.S., and believes that being in the U.S.\nmade the life-saving difference for his wife, who was successfully treated for cancer\nhere. He testified very credibly that he would never do anything in his personal or\nprofessional life that in any respect could be contrary to the national interest of the U.S.\nNeither he nor his wife has voted in the U.K. since moving to the U.S. They receive no\nfinancial or other benefits from the U.K. government, and have no political ties or other\naffiliation with it. (AE H; Exhibits 2-4 to Answer; Tr. at 88-90, 102-104, 109, 113-118,\n122-124, 127-128.)\nIn preparation for one business trip to Australia in 2005, Applicant\u2019s secretary and\ntravel agent inadvertently, and without his knowledge, used his now-expired U.K.\npassport to obtain the electronic visa from Australia. He discovered this on the day he\ntraveled, and accordingly had to use his U.K. passport for that visit. This was done\nwithout his knowledge, and it had been his intention to use his U.S. passport, as he\nregularly did after obtaining it. He did use his U.S. passport on his subsequent trip to\nAustralia in 2007. He has also stated that he had used his U.K. passport on rare\noccasions to access shorter immigration lines within the European Community, but not\nbecause of any preference for U.K. citizenship. (Answer at 2 and Exhibits 1, 2 at 7, 29,\n41, and 4 at 21; Tr. at 100-102, 128-129.)\nApplicant presented evidence, including testimony from one of his major account\nmanagers involved with the contracts requiring access to classified information, to\ndemonstrate that he would not personally be dealing with classified information and was\nseeking a clearance only because he needed it for the company to be granted the\nfacility clearance being sought to better serve defense-related customers. The\nrequirement that principal officers of a company seeking a facility clearance be eligible\nfor access to classified information is a policy determination that does not alter the\neligibility criteria set forth in the Directive. Accordingly, this evidence is not considered\nmaterial to determining Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.\n\n4\nThe chairman of Applicant\u2019s board of directors testified very credibly to\nApplicant\u2019s integrity, responsibility, trustworthiness, good character and loyalty as a U.S.\ncitizen. He had extensive experience with classified information and procedures, both as\na former military officer and in subsequent business ventures. He expressed supreme\nconfidence in Applicant\u2019s dedication to safeguarding sensitive and protected information\nof all types. (Tr. at 55-63, 67-71.)\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a democratically elected\ngovernment. It is \u201cone of the United States\u2019 closest allies and British foreign policy\nemphasizes close coordination with the United States. Bilateral cooperation reflects the\ncommon language, ideals, and democratic practices of the two nations.\u201d (AE C at 1, 7.)\nDepartment Counsel represented that the Government was not asserting any\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion in this case, based on the nature of the U.K. and its relationship with the\nU.S. (Tr. at 133-134, 139-142.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\n\n5\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition asserted by the Government in this\ncase is:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\n\n6\nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant did obtain a renewed U.K. passport in 2006.\nThis occurred before his company\u2019s need for a facility clearance arose, at a time when\nthere was no reason for him not to do so. He is a dual citizen by virtue of his birth in the\nU.K. and his decision, with his wife, to become U.S. citizens in 2004 because they\nintend to reside in the U.S. as Americans for the rest of their lives. He travels frequently\nand he obtained the U.K. passport as a matter of potential convenience due to shorter\nlines at European Community immigration stations. \nExcept for one inadvertent incident in 2005, as correctly alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b,\nApplicant has traveled exclusively using his U.S. passport since he obtained it, even\nwhen going to and from the U.K. His 2005 use of his U.K. passport in Australia occurred\ndue to a clerical error and was not an indication of preference for U.K. citizenship. He\nhad intended to use his U.S. passport for that trip, as he has done on all other travel\nsince. His 2006 renewal of the passport evidences his desire to retain his dual\ncitizenship, but is only minimally indicative of any preference for the U.K. over the U.S.\nDual citizenship, in and of itself, is not a disqualifying condition.\n \nThe evidence does not support any of the concerns listed in \u00b6 10(a)(2) through\n(7), or in \u00b6 10(b) through (d). As \u00b6 1.c of the SOR correctly alleged at the time it was\nissued, Applicant did own three properties in the U.K. worth more than $10.6 million. He\nhas subsequently purchased another property in London for one of his daughters to live\nin, bringing his total real estate holdings there to about $14 million. His citizenship status\nhas no bearing on his ability to buy or own these properties. His two daughters are his\nsole heirs, and both are U.K. citizens and residents. His investment in these properties\nwas pursuant to his attorney\u2019s estate planning advice to diversify his holdings into both\nBritish pounds and dollars, and ease their inheritance of assets. He still holds about 70%\nof his net worth in the U.S., so even this substantial investment is not indicative of any\npreference on his part for the U.K. over the U.S. Rather, it reflects sound financial\nmanagement. His overall financial situation reflects his preference for the U.S. and his\ncitizenship here. I do not consider his renewal of his U.K. passport to be an action to\nobtain recognition of foreign citizenship under \u00b6 10(b), since he already had a valid U.K.\npassport at the time, and his U.K. citizenship had been continuous since birth.\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s situation include: \u201c(a) dual citizenship is based solely on\nparents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\u201d and \u201c(e) the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d He\nwas born a citizen of the U.K. and came to the U.S. to work. After about nine years, and\npurely because they wanted to live the rest of their lives as U.S. citizens, he and his wife\nbecame naturalized citizens. When its possession became an issue of potential\nconcern, and since he was not using it anyway, Applicant surrendered his U.K. passport\nto his FSO where it will remain for as long as Applicant has any need for a security\nclearance. \n\n7\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two\nof them: \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information;\u201d and \u00b6 7(e), \u201ca substantial business,\nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Department Counsel specifically stated the Government\u2019s\nposition was that \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d did not apply. Based on review of the record evidence, and\nconsidering the foreign country involved, I concur with that position. As explained by\nDepartment Counsel, the Government\u2019s concern is not that the U.K. would attempt to\nexploit or coerce Applicant to disclose protected information based on his family or\nproperty there, but that the presence of his close family members and substantial\nproperty in the U.K. could create some influence to assist the U.K. and a conflict of\ninterest between his obligation to protect sensitive information and desire to help the\nU.K. It is undisputed that his daughters and grandchildren reside in the U.K., and he\nowns substantial property there. There is no evidence that the U.K. targets U.S. citizens\nto obtain protected information or is associated with a risk of terrorism, and I can discern\nno plausible scenario in which Applicant\u2019s illicit provision of protected information would\nbe considered beneficial by U.K. authorities. Thus, minimal security concerns are raised\nunder these disqualifying conditions.    \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in this case are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\n\n8\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.; and\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his family in the U.K. are close and important to\nhim. He has made substantial financial investments there for the benefit of his\ndaughters. None of his family members have any government connection, or are in any\nposition to benefit from his compromise of protected information. To the contrary, such\nconduct would put his substantial assets and freedom to visit with them at substantial\nrisk for no apparent gain. Particularly since the U.K. is a close ally that does not target\nU.S. citizens for protected information, it is highly unlikely that Applicant would be put in\na position of having to choose between any foreign interests and those of the U.S.\nAlthough his investments in the U.K. are very substantial by almost any standards, they\nstill represent less than 30% of his net worth, the remainder of which he holds in the\nU.S. He and his wife chose to become U.S. citizens, entirely independent of any security\nclearance considerations, because this is their new home and they intend to live here\npermanently. To the extent any minimal conflict of interest may be generated by some\ndesire to help the U.K. because he has family and property there, his professional,\nfinancial, and family ties in the U.S. are deeper and sufficiently longstanding that he can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There is no misconduct alleged by\nthe government. The single use of his U.K. passport three years ago, after becoming a\nU.S. citizen, was not a serious indication of foreign preference and was entirely an\ninadvertent incident that he did not intend to occur. Applicant is a fully mature,\ntrustworthy and successful executive who has been very successful in exercising\nsignificant responsibility over people and resources. His integrity is beyond reproach,\nand his loyalty to the U.S. is established by the record evidence. As Department\nCounsel expressed, there is no concern over pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\nbased on his family or property in the U.K. He has surrendered his U.K. passport, so it\u2019s\npossession will not continue.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from the citizenship status and residence of his\nfamily in the U.K., ownership of property there, and the circumstances surrounding his\nU.K. passport. Overall, the record evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has fully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guidelines C and B. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:                                   For Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings as to Guideline F are not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\nas amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 29, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey-Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant requests that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision be reversed. In support of that request,\nhe gives a detailed explanation as to the circumstances surrounding his arrests and convictions for\nthe incidents set forth in the SOR.  He asserts that, to the extent there are variances between his\nexplanations and the police reports, his version of the events is the correct one.  He also notes that\nhe has engaged in no other criminal conduct, other than the conduct alleged in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s\nargument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\n\nIn that regard, the Judge noted the following: \u201cIn May 2008, just three months before the hearing, he completed\n2\nhis three years of summary probation for his second offense.  Given the serious nature of the offenses, and their recency,\nmore time is needed in rehabilitation and without incident, to prove that he will not revert to his old criminal ways.\u201d\nDecision at 6.\n3\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness and recency of the disqualifying conduct and considered the\npossible application of relevant conditions and factors.  Decision at 4-7.  She reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  Id.   The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\n2\nrecord evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Chemical Crib Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. On February 15, 2001, the Applicant was charged with (1) Inflicting Corporal Injury Spouse, a felony; (2) Prevent Witness Force Threat, a felony; (3) Inflicting Corporal Injury Spouse, a felony; (4) Prevent Dissuade Witness Force Threat, a felony; (5) False Imprisonment, a felony; (6) Assault with Deadly Weapon/Instrument, a felony; and (7) Assault with Deadly Weapon/Instrument, a felony.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated January\n19, 2006.  On March 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 21, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on June 19, 2008.  It\nwas transferred to the undersigned Administrative Judge on July 2, 2008.  A notice of\nhearing was issued on July 8, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on\nAugust 19, 2008.  The Government presented ten exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 10, which were received without objection. The Applicant called one\nwitness, and presented eleven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.\nThe record remained open until close of business on September 2, 2008, to allow the\nApplicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted two Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.  DOHA\n\n2\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2008.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 41 years old, unmarried, and has a high school diploma and\nsome college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Chemical Crib Technician,\nand is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nOn February 15, 2001, the Applicant was charged with (1) Inflicting Corporal\nInjury Spouse, a felony; (2) Prevent Witness Force Threat, a felony; (3) Inflicting\nCorporal Injury Spouse, a felony; (4) Prevent Dissuade Witness Force Threat, a felony;\n(5) False Imprisonment, a felony; (6) Assault with Deadly Weapon/Instrument, a felony;\nand (7) Assault with Deadly Weapon/Instrument, a felony.  The Applicant explained that\nhe and his wife were living apart for a while under the premise that they were trying to\nwork on their relationship.  His wife was supposed to be out of town at her parents\nhouse.  The Applicant claims that he walked into her apartment and found her in bed\nwith another man.  (Tr. p. 43).  The police report of the incident is quite different.  It\nmentions nothing about another man being present in bed with the Applicant\u2019s wife at\nthe time of the incident.  The report states that the Applicant came into her apartment,\nuninvited, and into her bedroom while she was sleeping, and asked her who she had\nslept with.  She tried to call 911, but he prevented her from doing so by ripping the\ntelephone cord out of the wall.  He pushed her around, grabbed her thumb hyper-\nextending it, and grabbed her by her wrist causing it to bruise.  He punched wholes in a\nwall, a hallway closet door, and a picture hanging on the wall, and then left the location.\n(See Government Exhibit 3).  The Applicant pled guilty to Charge (1) and nolo\ncontendere to Charge (2).  He was found guilty of Charges (1) and (2).  Charges (3)\nthrough (7) were dismissed.  The Applicant was sentenced to supervised probation for\nthree years and to serve 365 days in jail.  He was also required to complete one year of\ndomestic violence counseling and pay restitution.  The Applicant has satisfied all of the\ncourt\u2019s sentencing requirements and actually served four months and fifteen days in jail\nbefore he was released early under county parole probation in August 2002.         \nOn January 4, 2005, the Applicant was charged with Battery Against Former\nSpouse/Fiancee, a misdemeanor.  The Applicant explained that he and his girlfriend\nhad gotten into an argument after having consumed alcohol.  She wanted to drive the\nApplicant home, however, the Applicant believed that she was too intoxicated to drive\nand he obstructed her from getting into her car.  He then began walking home.  The\nApplicant pled nolo contendere to the charge and was found guilty.  He was sentenced\nto 15 days in jail and was placed on probation for three years.  He was required to\nperform 12 hours of community service and to attend domestic violence counseling.\nThe Applicant has satisfied all of the courts sentencing requirements including paying\nhis restitution of $520.00 on August 15, 2006.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F and G).  He\n\n3\nwas released from summary probation on May 12, 2008.  (See Government Exhibit 5,\nand Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B). \nThe Applicant testified that his domestic violence counseling has been very\nhelpful to him.  He believes that his poor choices in the past will not be repeated\nbecause he has learned to control his impulses.  (Tr. p. 79).\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant\u2019s financial affairs of the past include a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy that\nhe filed on February 25, 1997.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  He was over-extended in\ncredit card debt and was laid off from his job for about two months in 1995.  Following\nhis layoff, he found work, but the pay was not good, and even with his wife working he\nwas unable to keep up with their monthly expenses.  In addition to the credit card debt,\nthe Applicant owed State and Federal taxes for miscalculating he and his wife\u2019s\nwithholding deductions.  His debts were discharged on June 19, 1997.\nThe Applicant remained indebted to ten separate creditors totaling approximately\n$10,000.00.  The debt included a federal tax lien in the amount of $3,700.00, telephone\nbills in the amount of $241.00, credit card debt in the amount of $1,620.00, $773.00,\n$167.00, $119.00, $1,771.00, and $1,679.00.  (See Government Exhibits 7, 8 and 9).\nHe attributes his indebtedness to a period of unemployment, his ex-wife\u2019s habit of living\nbeyond her means, and the cost of the divorce.  \nSince his divorce in 2002, he had been able to pay off all but two of the accounts\nset forth in the SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, I, J and K).  The two remaining debts\nset forth in allegations 1(c), and 1(h), of the SOR total approximately $3,000.00. With\nregard to these two debts, the Applicant has set up payment plans and is paying the\ndebts on a monthly basis.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and D).  \nApplicant\u2019s current financial report indicates that he can pay his monthly\nexpenses without difficulty.  He is scheduled to earn approximately $66,000.00 this\nyear.  He is also current with all of his other monthly obligations including his child\nsupport that is $625.00 monthly for two children that is automatically deducted out of his\npayroll account.   \nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who has known the Applicant for five years testified\nthat he supervises about sixteen people and the Applicant falls within the top one-third\nas far as job performance goes.  He does not know the particulars of the criminal\nmatters, but is aware of two altercations involving the Applicant\u2019s wife on one occasion,\nand his fianc\u00e9 on another.  He states that the Applicant has put his financial problems\nbehind him, as he has recently purchased a house, and the truck he had been driving\nwas not economical so he turned it in for a more economic car.  He is recommended for\na position of trust as it would open up more opportunities for the Applicant.  (Tr. pp. 24 -\n40). \n\n4\nThe Applicant also received a commendation form his company on February 5,\n2008 for high level of professionalism on the job and his contributions to the company.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nA letter from the Applicant dated August 19, 2008 indicates that he has always\nbeen involved in his children extra-curricular activities and has volunteered in the\ncommunity for a number of posts including, but not limited to Boy Scout Pack Leader\n2002, Super Science Saturday School Competition Judge, Soccer Coach for eight\nyears, Little League Board of Directors , Girls Softball Coach and T-ball coach for two\nyears to name a few.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.   The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\n\n6\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct and financial difficulties that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J) and financial considerations\n(Guideline F).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct and been financially irresponsible.  This\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant\u2019s criminal history involves two felony convictions for Spousal\nAbuse in 2001.  Four years later, in 2005, he was convicted of Battery upon a Spouse, a\nmisdemeanor.  Admittedly, he has undergone counseling for domestic abuse, spent four\nmonths and fifteen days of a year sentence in jail for one offense, fifteen days in jail for\nthe other, and paid restitution in both cases.  His last conviction occurred only three\nyears ago.  In May 2008, just three months before the hearing, he completed his three\nyears of summary probation for his second offense.  Given the serious nature of the\noffenses, and their recency, more time is needed in rehabilitation and without incident,\nto prove that he will not revert to his old criminal ways.  At this time, the Applicant does\nnot meet the eligibility for access to classified information.    \n\n7\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted applies.  None of the mitigating Conditions are applicable. \nWith regard to the Applicant\u2019s poor financial history, it appears that is was not\nentirely his fault.  His ex-wife\u2019s excessive spending, his period of unemployment and\ntheir divorce caused most of their financial problems.  Presently, the Applicant has paid\noff all but two of the debts and has made payment arrangements with the creditors and\nis making payments to pay them off.  He plans to continue paying the debts until they\nare paid in full.  He understands the importance of paying his bills on time and he is not\nliving beyond his means.  Under the circumstances, he has made a good faith effort to\nresolve his indebtedness, and there is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 20.(c) the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and 20.(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts also apply. \nThe Applicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.\nIn the event that the Applicant does not continue to pay his delinquent debts according\nto the payment plan or sooner if possible, his security clearance will be in immediate\njeopardy. This Applicant has paid or is currently paying his delinquent debts.  In this\nregard, he has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \n   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.\n\n8\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old married man with one child, age three. He is a high school graduate, and has taken some college courses. He is a communications technician who supports information transfer systems such as telecommunications systems on military installations (Tr. 25). Recently, his employer promoted him to senior project manager. He has been working in this field for 20 years, and has held a security clearance since 1992. In March 1986, Applicant lived in an apartment complex that had cable television service. He routed the cable to his television without paying for it. Later, a cable television repairman discovered the connection, and reported it to the cable television company. Then, Applicant was charged with unlawful cable television tampering and fined (Tr. 35). 3 One evening in May 1986, after an evening of heavy alcohol consumption with friends, Applicant threw a rock through a window at a neighborhood school. He was arrested and charged with burglary (Tr. 34). The charge was dropped after he attended a pre-trial intervention program. In 1989, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended license (Tr. 32). He paid a $25 fee to reinstate his license, and the charge was nolle prossed. Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1992. He pleaded no contest, paid a fine, and attended a court-sponsored substance abuse program (Tr. 31).

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer, requesting a hearing, on November 15,\n2007. I received the case assignment on December 27, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 4,\n2008. During the hearing, I received six government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nI received the transcript on March 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nApril 10, 2008\n\n2\nRulings of Evidence\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing subparagraph\n1.c, and adding the following subparagraphs:\n1.d. You falsified material facts on a National Agency Questionnaire executed by\nyou on August 15, 1991, in response to the following question: 20. Drug/Alcohol\nUse and Mental Health a. Have you ever tried or used or possessed any\nnarcotic (to include heroin or cocaine), depressant (to include quaaludes),\nstimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include\nmarijuana or hashish), or any mind-altering substance (to include glue or paint),\neven one time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a\nphysician?\u201d You answered \u201cyes\u201d and stated, \u201cI experimented with marijuana\nduring high school parties and have no desires to continue or partake in the use\nof illegal mind altering drugs at this time or in the future,\u201d whereas in truth, you\ndeliberately failed to disclose that you used marijuana once every couple of\nmonths after high school through at least 1991.\n1.e. In a signed, sworn statement executed by you on April 15 1992, and offered\nto a Special Agent of the Defense Investigative Service, you falsified material\nfacts when you stated, \u201cAfter graduation from high school, I left the area and\nnever smoked any marijuana after that period. I would estimate this to have been\nin May/June 83,\" whereas in truth, you had used marijuana once every couple of\nmonths after high school through at least 1991.\n2.g. You used marijuana with various degrees of intensity from 1981 to\napproximately 2001. \nApplicant did not object, and I granted the motion.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with one child, age three. He is a high\nschool graduate, and has taken some college courses. He is a communications\ntechnician who supports information transfer systems such as telecommunications\nsystems on military installations (Tr. 25). Recently, his employer promoted him to senior\nproject manager. He has been working in this field for 20 years, and has held a security\nclearance since 1992.\nIn March 1986, Applicant lived in an apartment complex that had cable television\nservice. He routed the cable to his television without paying for it. Later, a cable\ntelevision repairman discovered the connection, and reported it to the cable television\ncompany. Then, Applicant was charged with unlawful cable television tampering and\nfined (Tr. 35).\n\n3\nOne evening in May 1986, after an evening of heavy alcohol consumption with\nfriends, Applicant threw a rock through a window at a neighborhood school. He was\narrested and charged with burglary (Tr. 34). The charge was dropped after he attended\na pre-trial intervention program.\nIn 1989, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended license (Tr. 32).\nHe paid a $25 fee to reinstate his license, and the charge was nolle prossed.\nApplicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1992.\nHe pleaded no contest, paid a fine, and attended a court-sponsored substance abuse\nprogram (Tr. 31).\nIn 1998, Applicant, during the course of an argument with his then girlfriend,\nasked her to leave his home. She refused and grew hostile, whereupon he called the\npolice (Tr. 30). The police arrived and arrested both Applicant and his then girlfriend,\nand charged both with criminal domestic violence. He pleaded guilty and was fined $25.\nApplicant smoked marijuana occasionally from the early 1980s while in high\nschool through approximately 1991. He resumed in 1999, at age 34, and smoked\nthrough 2001. When Applicant first applied for a clearance in 1991, he disclosed his\nmarijuana use on his security clearance application. Later, when an investigative agent\nasked him to elaborate, he stated that he stopped smoking marijuana in approximately\n1983 (Exhibit 4 at 1).\nApplicant completed another security clearance application in March 2005. He\nwas required to disclose any illegal drug use in the past seven years. Fearing he would\nlose his job and his security clearance, he did not disclose his recurrent, late 1990s\nmarijuana use. He later disclosed it to an investigative agent in January 2006. By then,\nthe agent had interviewed him once before, and had interviewed his wife (Exhibit 3).\nThe agent\u2019s January 2006 re-interview was prompted by Applicant\u2019s wife, who informed\nthe agent during her interview of Applicant\u2019s past marijuana use.\n \nApplicant is an active volunteer with the Boy Scouts of America, and works with\nchildren in various camping clubs. (Tr. 59).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Of particular interest is any failure to provide truthful answers during the\nsecurity clearance process (Id.).\nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose marijuana use, as required in response to\nQuestion 27 of his 2005 security clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d applies.\nLying to the government in the belief that it is necessary to save one\u2019s job does\nnot mitigate Guideline E security concerns (DISCR OSD 87-0763 (App. Board Decision,\nJanuary 10, 1989)). Moreover, Applicant had previously provided false information\nabout his marijuana use during an earlier security clearance investigation. His eventual\ndisclosure did not occur until a second interview with an investigative agent that was\nprompted after his wife had informed the agent of his past marijuana use. \nAssuming for the sake of argument that Applicant\u2019s explanation for omitting past\nmarijuana use in response to Question 27 is true, he would not have disclosed the\nmarijuana use whether he understood Question 28 or not. I conclude he falsified\nQuestion 28, also.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns.\n\n5\nGuideline J\nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal behavior triggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca\nsingle, serious crime or multiple lesser offense,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Most of Applicant\u2019s offenses were petty crimes that\noccurred more than 20 years ago in his youth. Although the domestic violence and the\nDUI charge are more recent and serious, neither occurred in the last nine years, and no\nadditional evidence supports any propensity toward domestic violence or drinking and\ndriving.\nApplicant has not smoked marijuana since 2001. He is a productive member of\nsociety who is committed to his family, and is actively involved in volunteer\norganizations. He was recently promoted to a supervisory position at work. Under these\ncircumstances, his security clearance falsifications, though technically criminal\nviolations, are not indicative of an ongoing pattern of criminality that pose a security\nconcern under the criminal conduct guideline. AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d applies. He has\nmitigated the criminal conduct security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nEvaluating this case in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant\u2019s\nfalsifications of his 2005 security clearance and his falsification to an investigative agent\nin approximately 1991 continue to pose a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n6\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since November 2005. She has never received a trustworthiness determination. Applicant was previously married and divorced. The date of her divorce is not reflected in the record, but it appears to have been before November 2002. She and her former spouse had two children, ages 14 and 12, who live with their father. She also has a 17-year-old child whose father has custody and who lives with his grandmother. Applicant pays child support for all three children. She has an 18-year-old daughter who was living with her at the time of her application for a public trust position (GX 5 at 6-7; GX 6 at 4-5). In October 2005, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In her petition, she listed assets of $600 and liabilities of $54,236.23. She listed net monthly income of $1,280 and her expenses of $1,250. The court granted Applicant a discharge in March 2006 (GX 7 at 3-52). Applicant told a security investigator the bankruptcy was caused by unemployment and her divorce (GX 6 at 3). Her SF 85P reflects unemployment from December 1997 to September 1999, August 2001 to July 2002, March and April 2003, and January to May 2005.

Eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on \nNovember 28, 2005. On March 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary \ndecision to deny her application, citing trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and \nE. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 27, 2008. She answered \nthe Guideline F allegations on May 6, 2008, and requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing. She answered the Guideline E allegations on June 30, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on August 21, 2008. On \nAugust 22, 2008, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), including \nGovernment Exhibits (GX 1) through 14, was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on September 2, 2008, but she did not \nrespond within the prescribed 30-day period, which expired on October 2, 2008.  \n \nOn October 9, 2008, Applicant mailed Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A to DOHA, and it \nwas received on October 14, 2008. Department Counsel did not object to consideration \nof her untimely submission, but argued that it should be given no weight. Department \nCounsel\u2019s comments are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. The case was \nassigned to me on October 24, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since November 2005. She has never received a trustworthiness \ndetermination.  \n \nApplicant was previously married and divorced. The date of her divorce is not \nreflected in the record, but it appears to have been before November 2002. She and her \nformer spouse had two children, ages 14 and 12, who live with their father. She also \nhas a 17-year-old child whose father has custody and who lives with his grandmother. \nApplicant pays child support for all three children. She has an 18-year-old daughter who \nwas living with her at the time of her application for a public trust position (GX 5 at 6-7; \nGX 6 at 4-5).  \n \nIn October 2005, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. In her petition, she listed assets of $600 and liabilities of $54,236.23. She \nlisted net monthly income of $1,280 and her expenses of $1,250. The court granted \nApplicant a discharge in March 2006 (GX 7 at 3-52).  \n \nApplicant told a security investigator the bankruptcy was caused by \nunemployment and her divorce (GX 6 at 3). Her SF 85P reflects unemployment from \nDecember 1997 to September 1999, August 2001 to July 2002, March and April 2003, \nand January to May 2005. After Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, she was unemployed \nfrom September to November 2005, when she started her current job (GX 5 at 3-5).  \n \nWhen Applicant was divorced, her spouse agreed to be responsible for a joint \ncredit union loan of about $20,000. He allowed the payments to become delinquent, and \nApplicant included the debt in her bankruptcy. \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant signed a one-year lease for an apartment in November 2002. After \nthree months, she stopped paying rent and moved to low-income housing. The \napartment landlord obtained a judgment against her, which was included in her \nbankruptcy. \n \nApplicant was laid off from work in March 2003 and was unable to pay her rent. \nThe landlord obtained a judgment for unpaid rent, which was included in her \nbankruptcy.  \n \nApplicant purchased a used car in about March 2003 and made payments until \nNovember 2003, when she surrendered the car and stopped making payments because \nthe car was not operating properly. This debt was included in her bankruptcy. \n \nApplicant moved into another apartment in May 2004, taking over an existing \nlease from her former sister-in-law. After paying rent for two months, she moved in with \na friend and stopped paying rent on the apartment. The landlord obtained a judgment \nfor unpaid rent, which was included in her bankruptcy.  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on August 7, 2006, Applicant \nstated the cell phone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d should have been included in her \nbankruptcy, but it is not listed on Schedule F of her bankruptcy petition, nor is the cell \nphone company listed in the certificate of service. The debt arose in 2004 when \nApplicant returned the cell phone without completing the contract because she was \nunhappy with the service (GX 6 at 6).  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant claimed she did not know anything about \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. Her most recent credit report reflects that the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a delinquent student loan (GX 8 at 2). The debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f does not appear on the most recent credit report.  \n \nOn October 9, 2008, Applicant submitted evidence that she was enrolled in a \nconsumer credit counseling service (AX A). The counseling service proposed a \npayment plan for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h through 1.k. The plan \nincludes the cell phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which Applicant denied in her answer to the \nSOR. The plan does not address the unpaid fines alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c or \ndelinquent student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. There is no evidence her creditors have \nagreed to the payment plan or that she has made any payments.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $1,120. Her expenses are about $940 \nper month, leaving a net remainder of about $180. She has virtually no savings and \nowns a car worth about $2,000.  \n \n\n4 \n \nThe following table summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nAnswer \nTo SOR \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.b \nParking Ticket \n$108 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 4 \n1.c \nTraffic Fine \n$585 \nAdmit \nPaid in part \nGX 4 \n1.d \nCell Phone \n$421 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 6 at 6; AX A \n1.e \nBad Check \n$228 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 8 at 2; AX A \n1.f \nStudent Loan \n$1,529 \nDeny \nNot Proven \nGX 4; GX 8 \n1.g \nStudent Loan \n$2,432 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4;GX 8 at 2 \n1.h \nCollection \n$713 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 8 at 2; AX A \n1.i \nMedical \n$229 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 8 at 2; AX A \n1.j \nMedical \n$339 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 8 at 2; AX A \n1.k \nCell Phone \n$626 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4; GX 8 at 1; AX A \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 85P in November 2005, she answered \u201cyes\u201d to \nquestion 16, asking if she had been charged with or convicted of any offense other than \ntraffic fines of less than $150. She disclosed receiving a ticket in May 2005 for riding in \na HOV [High Occupancy Vehicle] lane, but she did not disclose a $585 fine imposed in \nJanuary 2005 for driving on a suspended, revoked, or cancelled license. The record \nreflects issuance of a warrant for failure to appear in court in May 2005, but it does not \nreflect whether the warrant was served or Applicant responded to it (GX 14). Although \nthe SOR \u00b6 1.c alleged she failed to appear in court for the driver\u2019s license offense, the \ncourt records reflect that the charge of failure to appear occurred in November 2003 in \nconnection with the traffic ticket alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (GX 13). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are entitled to adjudication under \nto the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(c). The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The administrative judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. \n\n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). An unfavorable trustworthiness \ndetermination is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines for a favorable \ndetermination. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand ten delinquent debts totaling $7,210 (SSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k). Applicant admitted five \ndelinquent debts totaling $1,489 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j). The trustworthiness \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is raised where there is \nAindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any \nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the \ndebt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nestablished because there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending.  \n\n6 \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nTrustworthiness concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by \nshowing that Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, recent, and not the product of unusual circumstances that are not \nlikely to recur. They raise doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \n Applicant\u2019s divorce and her periods of unemployment were conditions beyond \nher control, establishing the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). The second prong, however, is \nnot established. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy was precipitated by her divorce and periods of \nunemployment, but she contributed to her financial distress by repeatedly disregarding \nher obligations with respect to her apartment leases, car loan, and traffic violations. Her \nlast period of unemployment was after her bankruptcy and before her current \nemployment. She has worked steadily for almost three years. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, she promised to resolve all her delinquent debts by November 2007, but \nshe presented no evidence of any actions to resolve her delinquent debts until October \n9, 2008, when she enrolled in a consumer credit counseling program.  \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). \nAlthough Applicant has enrolled in a credit counseling program, this mitigating condition \nis not established because it does not encompass all her delinquent debts, there is no \nevidence the payment plan has been accepted by her creditors, and there is no \nevidence of payments under the plan. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \n\n7 \n \nApplicant has enrolled in a credit counseling program and submitted a proposed \npayment plan, but this mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has \nproduced no evidence that she has made any payments under the plan. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the unresolved parking ticket and unresolved traffic \nviolation alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant falsified her \nSF 85P by failing to disclose her $585 fine for driving on a suspended, revoked or \ncancelled driver\u2019s license. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as \nfollows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(c) is relevant to Applicant\u2019s failures to \nresolve the parking ticket and traffic violation. This disqualifying condition is raised by \n\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and \nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined \nwith all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s disregard for her legal obligations \nis sufficient \u201ccredible adverse information\u201d to raise this disqualifying condition.  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to her failure to disclose her traffic \nviolation is set out in AG \u00b6 16(a) as follows: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s denied falsifying her SF 85P. She admitted being fined $585 for \ndriving without a valid license. She has offered no explanation for disclosing the HOV \n\n8 \n \nviolation but not disclosing her more recent and more serious offense of driving without \na valid license. I conclude the security concern in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns raised by false or misleading answers on an \napplication for a public trust position may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). In her answer to the SOR, she \ninsisted she answered the question truthfully. While her answer to question 16 on the \nSF 85P was truthful, it was incomplete, and she made no effort to correct the omission. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns raised by personal conduct can be mitigated by \nshowing \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification was not minor, it was recent, it did not happen under unique circumstances, \nand it casts doubt on her reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a sensitive \nposition must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed in my discussions of Guidelines F and E, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has suffered periods of unemployment and a marital breakup, but she \nreceived a fresh start with her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2006. She had \none additional period of unemployment after her bankruptcy, but has been steadily \nemployed for almost three years. She is again in financial distress. For the first time, \nshe has enrolled in a credit counseling program, but it is too soon to tell if she will \n\n9 \n \nadhere to whatever payment plan she can devise. Her lack of candor on her SF 85P \nraises questions about her reliability and trustworthiness. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by her financial problems and personal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant her eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for assignment \nto a public trust position is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

He has worked for his employer for five years. He is divorced and has a 17-year-old daughter. He is taking classes toward earning an associate\u2019s degree. He served briefly in the Air Force from August 1973 through September 1974, when he was discharged from the Air Force because he was experiencing \u201cflashback phenomena during his technical training\u201d due to his extensive usage of LSD prior to entering the military, as well as his \u201cmultiple prior service illegal drug use,\u201d and his \u201cuse of illegal drugs\u201d after entering the Air Force.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 12, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 3, 2011. Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge in an undated submission. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 1, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 15, \n2011, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 4, 2011. The Government \n\n \n2 \n \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were admitted without objection. It also \nintroduced three documents for Administrative Notice, marked I through III. The \nApplicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were also admitted without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 12, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k. 2.a., \n2.b., 2.c., 2.d., 2.f., 2.h., and 2.i.1 He denies allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.i., 2.e., and 2.g. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis employer for five years. He is divorced and has a 17-year-old daughter. He is taking \nclasses toward earning an associate\u2019s degree. He served briefly in the Air Force from \nAugust 1973 through September 1974, when he was discharged from the Air Force \nbecause he was experiencing \u201cflashback phenomena during his technical training\u201d due \nto his extensive usage of LSD prior to entering the military, as well as his \u201cmultiple prior \nservice illegal drug use,\u201d and his \u201cuse of illegal drugs\u201d after entering the Air Force. (GE \n2; GE 4 through GE 8; AE C; Tr. 42, 51-52, 57-59, 77-80.) \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history with illegal substances. He first used illegal drugs in \nhigh school. His accounts regarding the types of illegal drugs used, duration of use, and   \nfrequency of drug use change throughout the evidence. However, it is clear that his \ndrug history includes use of marijuana, methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, PCP, \nmushrooms, mescaline, LSD, and hashish. (GE 6; GE 8; GE 9; Tr. 44-51.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use began in approximately 1973 and continued until at \nleast summer of 2009, with varying frequencies. He began using marijuana in high \nschool. His use continued after joining the Air Force in 1973, despite applying for a \nsecurity clearance through the Air Force. He used marijuana periodically until \napproximately 2003, when his use increased to daily. At that time, Applicant was \nprescribed the drug \u201cmorphine sulfate\u201d and was unable to sleep. He used marijuana to \nhelp him sleep. From 2004 to 2006, he was prescribed \u201clithium sulfate\u201d and again used \nmarijuana to help him sleep. Although he testified that his last marijuana use was in \n2004, he later confessed his marijuana use continued through 2006, when he stopped \ntaking the lithium sulfate. Upon further examination, he admitted his last use of \nmarijuana was \u201cprobably last summer,\u201d referring to the summer of 2009. (GE 6; GE 8 \nthrough GE 11; GE 13; Tr. 44-46, 62-63, 97-100.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he used LSD and mescaline approximately six times in 1973 \nat parties \u201cto be sociable.\u201d While in the Air Force, Applicant used hashish approximately \n6-to-12 times. (GE 3.) In a February 2008 Affidavit, he also admitted: \n \n                                                          \n1 The SOR was incorrectly lettered and alleged this allegation as a second 2.g. Applicant\u2019s answer addresses this \nallegation as 2.i. \n\n \n3 \n \nFrom the ages of fifteen through thirty, I used various drugs. . . I snorted \ncrystal methamphetamine in the form of a powder on a monthly basis, \nwhich made me feel high for a duration of twelve hours. I snorted cocaine \nin the powder form two to three times a year, which made me feel high for \na duration of twelve hours. I injected heroin two to three times a year, \nwhich made me feel high for a duration of four to eight hours. I smoked \nPhencyclidine (PCP) in the form of a powder two to three times a year, \nwhich made me feel high for a duration of two to three hours. I orally \ningested mushrooms two to three times a year, which made me feel high \nfor a duration of two to three hours. (GE 6; Tr. 50-51.) \n \n \n \nIn 1994, Applicant voluntarily attended a treatment program for his alcohol and \ndrug use, to include marijuana dependency. The first two weeks of the program were \ninpatient and the remaining ten weeks were an outpatient program. Applicant contends \nthat he had no aftercare requirements and sought no further treatment until 2003. (GE \n6, Tr. 52- 55, 85-86.) \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant sought treatment for his addiction to prescribed pain killers he \nhad been taking to help deal with degenerative disk disease.  During his treatment, he \nwas diagnosed as bi-polar and prescribed lithium sulfate. The medical records also note \nApplicant had been abusing marijuana. He attended approximately six weeks of \noutpatient treatment. After treatment, he attended support groups including Narcotics \nAnonymous and Marijuana Anonymous. He last attended a support group in 2003. (GE \n10; Tr. 37-40; 63-67, 85-93.) \n \n \nSubsequently, he switched medical insurances and was required to find a new \ndoctor to treat him in 2004. His general practitioner referred him to a psychiatrist. The \npsychiatrist continued to prescribe him lithium sulfate for his bi-polar diagnosis and \nadditionally diagnosed him with cannabis dependence, after he disclosed extensive \nmarijuana use for over 35 years to her.  At hearing, he testified that he only saw the \npsychiatrist two-to-three times. However, the psychiatrist\u2019s records reflect that Applicant \nmet with her five times from March 2004 through October 2004. He returned to his \ngeneral practitioner for treatment after terminating his relationship with the psychiatrist. \nHe decided to take himself off the lithium in approximately 2006 since he does not \nbelieve he is bi-polar. He presented a letter from his treating clinical psychologist that he \nhas met with twice since the initial consultation, who opined Applicant \u201ccould be \nconsidered a reliable historian who is not exhibiting any issues consistent with judgment \nor honesty problems.\u201d She also noted \u201cit would appear that since [Applicant] has ceased \nusing cannabis and/or any other substances and has learned how to maintain any \nsymptoms consistent with depression or mood lability [sic], he is doing quite well at this \ntime.\u201d Applicant has signed and notarized a statement indicating that he \u201cwill not use \nCannabis in violation of Federal Law\u201d and he \u201cunderstand[s] and agree[s] that any future \nuse of a controlled substance will result in automatic revocation of my security \nclearance.\u201d (GE 10; GE 11; GE 12; GE 13; AE F; Tr. 37-40; 63-67, 85-93.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance applications indicate that he held a secret security \nclearance issued by another government agency in 1988. He testified that he held the \n\n \n4 \n \nclearance for three years. In truth, he applied for a clearance on a July 1989 security \nclearance application. That application included, \u201cQuestion 15: Medical/Financial a. \nHave you ever used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD \nor PCP) or Cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish) except as prescribed by a \nlicensed physician?\u201d To which Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d seeking to conceal his prior \ndrug use. Applicant admitted he did not list his marijuana use on the application \n\u201cbecause [he] knew if [he] admitted to it, [he] wouldn\u2019t get the clearance.\u201d (GE 1; TR 60.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service in connection with his \nsecurity clearance application in 1990. During this interview, he gave a written \nstatement and again falsified information regarding his drug use when he claimed, \u201cI last \nused marijuana in 1973.\u201d Further, he failed to disclose his use of methamphetamines, \ncocaine, heroin, PCP and mushrooms in the same statement. At the hearing, Applicant \ndid not deny he made false statements in his March 1990 signed and sworn statement. \n(GE 3; Tr. 61.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s lies continued on his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (eQIP) dated July 2006. On the eQIP, he was asked, \u201cSection 21. Your \nMedical Record In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional \n(psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc) or have you consulted with another health \ncare provider about a mental health related condition?\u201d and omitted his counseling with \nthe psychiatrist from March 2004 through October 2004. The eQIP also asked, \u201cSection \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity: a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 \nyears, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for \nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, Methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs, and b. Have \nyou ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement \nofficer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while \nin a position directly or immediately affecting public safety?\u201d Applicant answered both of \nthese questions, \u201cNo,\u201d intentionally concealing he was still using marijuana and had \nused marijuana while holding a security clearance in approximately 1989-1991.  (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant executed and submitted an affidavit to an agent of \nthe Office of Personnel Management that indicated, \u201cfrom the ages of fifteen through \nthirty, I used various drugs. I smoked marijuana out of a bowl and joint and also \ningested it within various foods on a daily basis.\u201d He deliberately falsified this statement, \nas he knew and sought to conceal that he used marijuana until at least 2009. (GE 6.) \n \n \nApplicant completed a second eQIP in October 2009. On the eQIP, he was \nasked, \u201cSection 21. Your Medical Record In the last 7 years, have you consulted a \nhealth professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition or were you \nhospitalized for such a condition?\u201d and again omitted his counseling with the psychiatrist \nfrom March 2004 through October 2004. The eQIP also asked, \u201cSection 23. Your Use of \nIllegal Drugs and Drug Activity: a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,  have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, \nTHC (marijuana, hashish, etc.), narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), \n\n \n5 \n \nstimulants (amphetamines, Ecstasy, ketamine, etc), depressants (barbiturates, \nMethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription \ndrugs (including painkillers)? and b. Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance \nwhile employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly or immediately affecting \npublic safety?\u201d Again, Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d concealing his marijuana use and his \ndrug use while holding a secret clearance, detailed above. \n \n \nApplicant presented documentation that shows his work evaluations find him \n\u201cexceptional\u201d on the majority of his evaluation criteria. He also presented photographs \ndepicting Applicant in several of his job functions.  (AE A; AE B; AE D.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n6 \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to Drug Involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \nand \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the factual \nallegations under Guideline H (SOR 1.a. through 1.k.). Applicant began using illegal \nsubstances in the early 1970\u2019s to include marijuana, methamphetamines, cocaine, \nheroin, PCP, mushrooms, mescaline, LSD and hashish. He purports his last use of \nmarijuana to have been in summer 2009. He used marijuana while holding a secret \nsecurity clearance from 1989-1991. Additionally, in 2004 he was diagnosed with \ncannabis dependence by his treating psychiatrist. These facts, established through the \nGovernment\u2019s information and through Applicant\u2019s admissions, raise a security concern \nunder all of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; and \n \n(c) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has not used methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, PCP, \nmushrooms, mescaline, LSD or hashish for a number of years, his use of marijuana \nthrough at least 2009 is recent. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances. While he asserts that he mainly used marijuana to help him sleep due to \nside effects of prescription medications, he continued his marijuana use long after he \nceased taking the prescription medications.  Moreover, the fact that he held a security \nclearance did not prevent him from engaging in this questionable conduct. He continued \nto use marijuana after his treatment for marijuana dependency. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(a) applies in part, only in regard to his early use of methamphetamines, cocaine, \nheroin, PCP, mushrooms, mescaline, LSD and hashish.  \n \nAs to AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), Applicant provided a signed statement indicating that he will \nnot use marijuana in the future. However, Applicant's failure to disclose his illegal drug \nuse on his 1989 security clearance application, his 1990 sworn statement, his 2006 \neQIP, his 2008 affidavit, and his 2009 eQIP, undermines the reliability of any such \nstatement. Applicant has a history of falsifying documents provided to the Government \nand cannot be taken at his word. Further, he failed to show that he has disassociated \nhimself from drug-using contacts, that he has changed his environment in a meaningful \nway, or has an appropriate period of abstinence. No mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 \n26(b).  \n \nWith respect to AG \u00b6 26(d), Applicant has received treatment for cannabis \ndependency. However, his marijuana use recurred, despite his past treatment. His \ncurrent clinical psychologist opined that he has \u201cceased using cannabis\u201d and is not \nexhibiting issues with judgment and honesty. Applicant did not present evidence that \nestablished she treated him for his drug use specifically, or that since 2009 he \ncompleted any type of prescribed drug treatment program. From his clinical \npsychologist\u2019s letter, it is impossible to tell if she was aware of the full extent of \nApplicant\u2019s drug use and history of falsification. She has only treated Applicant twice in \napproximately a seven month period, after their initial interview in August 2010. Her \nletter is not convincing evidence of successful rehabilitation. Further, due to Applicant\u2019s \npast relapses, not enough time has passed to ascertain whether Applicant will abstain \nfor marijuana use in the future, given a 40-year history of use. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not \napply. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant claimed he had not used marijuana in \nalmost two years. There is no bright line defining an appropriate period of reform and \nrehabilitation. In some cases, two years could be interpreted as a sufficient period of \nabstinence. However, the fact that Applicant used marijuana for approximately 40 years \nand knowingly used marijuana after he was granted a security clearance in 1989, \nindicates Applicant lacks the judgment needed to hold a security clearance and weighs \nagainst a conclusion that sufficient time has passed. The partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26 does not overcome the gravity of the fact that Applicant chose to use marijuana while \nhe held a security clearance. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, \nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that \ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for \nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or \nother group. \n \n \nApplicant admits to the falsification of his July 1989 Security Clearance \nApplication, his 1990 sworn statement, his 2008 affidavit, Section 24.a. and 24.b. on his \n2006 eQIP, and Section 23.a. and 23.b. on his 2009 eQIP. The Government also \npresented sufficient information to establish that Applicant falsified Section 21 on his \n2006 e-QIP and Section 21 on his 2009 eQIP. His explanation that he omitted his \npsychiatrist from these documents unintentionally is simply not credible. The \n\n \n9 \n \nGovernment has established sufficient concern under AG \u00b6 16(a) to disqualify Applicant \nfrom possessing a clearance.  \n \n \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s 40-years of illegal drug use cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. During his 40-years of drug use, Applicant \nchose to engage in the use of illegal substances, while possessing a security clearance. \nHis personal conduct displays questionable judgment and creates vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is disqualifying. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant's falsification and poor judgment is unmitigated. Falsification of \ninformation provided to the Government cannot be considered minor. Applicant \nconcealed his marijuana use and use of marijuana while possessing a clearance from \nthe Government throughout the time he held a secret clearance from 1989 to 1991, and \nin his attempts to get a clearance in 2006 through 2009. He also concealed his \ntreatment in 2004 with the psychiatrist. He made no attempts to disclose his drug use \nand treatment and repeatedly lied about the facts when he was confronted with the truth \nduring his interviews and subsequent statements. His lies extend from 1989 to the \ninterrogatories he completed in 2008, and throughout the hearing in the instant matter, \nas he was not honest about the date of his last use during the hearing. Because of \nApplicant\u2019s long history of lying and his extensive history of marijuana use, I cannot find \nthat such behavior is unlikely to recur. While Applicant may be seeking counseling, he \nhas only met with his clinical psychologist twice since his initial assessment and he has \nfailed to show positive steps to establish he is now reliable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nWeighing in Applicant's favor are his successful performance at work and his \nexcellent work performance ratings. However, his conduct overall indicates a lack of \njudgment and trustworthiness, and raises doubts as to whether he understands what is \nrequired of those who hold security clearances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged that Applicant owes 16 delinquent debts totaling $21,557 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.p). In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the debts without explanation. After a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 35 years old and an employee of a TRICARE managed care support contractor. She requires access to sensitive health care information in the performance of her duties as a health care finder since January 2007 (Item 5). Applicant and her spouse were married in 1991. They have three children, who were born in January 1992, June 1996, and April 2003. Shortly before the birth of her second child, Applicant earned her associate\u2019s degree. From October 1999 to May 2003, she worked as an accounting clerk for a contractor on a military installation. Following the birth of her third child, she did not work outside the home from June 2003 to August 2004. After a few months as a data entry clerk for an office staffing agency, Applicant began working as a claims processor in December 2004. She started her present employment in January 2007 (Item 5). On January 23, 2007, Applicant executed a SF 85P on which she responded affirmatively to question 22b, \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\u201d.

Her efforts to address her delinquent debt are very recent and not sufficient\nto mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on\nJanuary 23, 2007. On December 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F as the basis for its decision to deny her\nrequest for a position of trust. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nJune 9, 2008\n\nApplicant and most likely her spouse took out a joint automobile loan of $23,412 in August 2000. The monthly\n1\ncar payment was $470. The credit bureaus reported in February 2007 that a $4,056 balance was charged off\nin July 2006 (Item 8).\n2\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 14, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record without a hearing. On March 5, 2008, the government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within\n30 days of receipt. Applicant did not respond by the April 12, 2008, due date. On May\n27, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness position for her. Based upon\na review of the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 4), eligibility for a\npublic trust position is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged that Applicant owes 16 delinquent debts totaling $21,557 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a-1.p). In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the debts without explanation. After a\nreview of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 35 years old and an employee of a TRICARE managed care support\ncontractor. She requires access to sensitive health care information in the performance\nof her duties as a health care finder since January 2007 (Item 5).\nApplicant and her spouse were married in 1991. They have three children, who\nwere born in January 1992, June 1996, and April 2003. Shortly before the birth of her\nsecond child, Applicant earned her associate\u2019s degree. From October 1999 to May\n2003, she worked as an accounting clerk for a contractor on a military installation.\nFollowing the birth of her third child, she did not work outside the home from June 2003\nto August 2004.  After a few months as a data entry clerk for an office staffing agency,\nApplicant began working as a claims processor in December 2004. She started her\npresent employment in January 2007 (Item 5).\nOn January 23, 2007, Applicant executed a SF 85P on which she responded\naffirmatively to question 22b, \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or\nfinancial obligation?\u201d. She listed two personal loan debts (SOR \u00b6 1.e and a loan debt\nthat was not alleged) (Item 5).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on February 27, 2007, revealed collection balances\nof $2,489 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $530 on the debts listed on her SF 85P. The credit bureaus\nreported additional delinquent debt of about $20,380 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\u20131.d, 1.f\u20131.o),\nincluding a $4,056 auto loan debt (not alleged) charged off in July 2006.  Her credit\n1\nreport showed a history of late payments starting in 2001 (Item 8). Applicant expressed\n\nPer the November 2007 credit report (Item 7), the credit card account in SOR \u00b6 1.b reached a high credit of\n2\n$930 before it was transferred. A collection agency was reporting an account with a high credit of $930 had\nan updated balance of $2,068 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In the settlement offer (Item 6), the collection agency in SOR \u00b6\n1.a is listed as the owner of the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The principal balance of the debt was $930.40,\nwhich with fees and finances charges had reached $1,980.51 as of September 2007.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is likely an updated balance of the delinquent loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, even though\n3\nthe account numbers are not the same. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was charged off in the amount of $2,371 in\nNovember 2003, and the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.e was opened in September 2004 with a last activity\ndate in November 2003. Moreover, the original creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is named in the February\n2007 credit report (Item 8) and its initials match those of the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nBoth credit reports (Items 7 and 8) report the debt balance as $62 rather than the $52 alleged.\n4\n3\na willingness to resolve her indebtedness during an interview with an authorized\ninvestigator for the Department of Defense held on April 18, 2007 (Item 6).\nBy letter of July 13, 2007, an assignee for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m gave Applicant\noptions to satisfy her $51.55 balance that had been in collection since March 2006.\nApplicant paid the debt by money order on October 5, 2007 (Item 6). On September 17,\n2007, a financial solutions\u2019 company informed Applicant that she could resolve her\ndelinquent credit card balance of $1,980.51 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, same debt)  by\n2\nopening a new credit card account. The debt balance of her old account would be\ntransferred to this new account and she would be required to make $35 monthly\npayments until the balance was paid in full. Applicant accepted the offer but had not\nmade any payments before October 5, 2007 (Item 6). On September 28, 2007,\nApplicant was offered a settlement of the $530 loan debt she had listed on her SF 85P.\nShe could make either a one-time payment of $265, on receipt of which the debt would\nbe considered settled, or pay $318 through a plan of $30 minimum payments (Item 6).\nThere is no evidence of any payments.\nIn about September 2007, DOHA asked Applicant to document satisfaction or\npayment arrangements of certain debt balances: $2,489 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, updated balance\nof SOR \u00b6 1.f),  $2,371 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, same debt as \u00b6 1.e), $1,915 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $30 (not\n3\nalleged, collection debt duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.d), $9,690 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $734 (SOR \u00b6\n1.o), $424 (SOR \u00b6 1.j), $336 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), $168 (SOR \u00b6 1.n), $62 (SOR \u00b6 1.h),  $52\n4\n(SOR \u00b6 1.m), $530 (not alleged, listed on SF 85P), $512 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $238 (SOR \u00b6 1.i),\n$210 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and $30 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). On October 5, 2007, Applicant indicated she\nhad satisfied only the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, but the collection agency holding SOR \u00b6 1.e\nhad offered to settle for $934.28 and she was saving the funds needed. She expressed\nher belief that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f were the same debt, and that the $30\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was included in the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.m. She added that she had\naccepted a credit card offer to make payments with no interest on the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.b, would have to work with her husband about resolving the car note (SOR \u00b6 1.c), had\ncontacted the creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.h, and was arranging to make $30 payments in\nresponse to an offer to settle the $530 loan debt for $318 (not alleged). Applicant\nfurnished copies of the settlement offer on the $530 loan debt, of the money order\nsatisfying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, and of the opportunity to resolve her debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.b by opening a new credit card account (Item 6).\n\nThe $30 collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d does not appear on her latest credit report but there is no evidence from\n5\nwhich I could reasonably conclude that the balance was transferred to the creditor named in SOR \u00b6 1.m.\n4\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 28, 2007, showed outstanding\ncollection balances of $2,489 on SOR \u00b6 1.e (likely the updated balance of SOR \u00b6 1.f)\nand $2,068 on SOR \u00b6 1.a (updated balance of SOR \u00b6 1.b). A recent debt of $268 on\nanother account (SOR \u00b6 1.p) had been charged off in March 2007. The credit bureau\nhad yet to update its records to reflect Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m.\nTwo auto lenders were reporting zero balances on charged off debts of $9,690 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c) and $4,056 (not alleged), but there is no proof they have been paid. Her credit\nreport also showed no progress toward resolving the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j,\nand 1.k (Item 7).5\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\n\n5\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nApplicant has a record of financial delinquency since about 2001. Her credit card\naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in March 2002, she made no payments on her\nauto loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c after July 2002, and the $30 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was referred for\ncollection in August 2002. Additional delinquent debt was charged off and/or placed for\ncollection in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f and the $530 personal loan debt not alleged), in 2004\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j), in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), in 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and\nthe $4,056 auto loan debt not alleged) and in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d) apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too pervasive and too recent to satisfy\nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d).\nApplicant fell behind in her payments on two sizeable automobile loans, including SOR\n\u00b6 1.c, but several accounts of less than $200 also went unpaid. Assuming the amount\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is an updated balance of the delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.f,\nApplicant still accumulated almost $20,000 in delinquent debt. She has paid only\n\n6\n$51.55 toward her delinquent debt as of October 2007. Her acceptance of the terms\noffered to settle the $530 personal loan debt (not alleged) and the credit card debt\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, same debt) are preliminary. Without a track record of regular\npayments, I am unable to conclude that either AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) or AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) apply.\nApplicant has not explained her failure to remain current in her financial\nobligations. She reported on her SF 85P a period of unemployment from June 2003 to\nAugust 2004 following the birth of her youngest child. Her unemployment and the\nfinancial burdens of raising children likely had an impact on her financial situation, but I\ncannot speculate as to the extent. Furthermore, even if I was to find that there were\ncircumstances beyond her control that caused her to fall behind, Applicant has offered\nno reasonable justification for waiting until October 2007 to respond to one assignee\u2019s\neffort in July 2007 to collect its debt of only $51.55 (SOR \u00b6 1.m).  Based on the limited\ninformation available for review, I am also unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons in sensitive positions can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all times.\nApplicant remains under a significant debt burden that is not likely to be resolved in the\nnear future. She indicated in October 2007 that she was saving money to settle the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for a reduced payment of $934.28. If collection of her delinquent auto\n\n7\nloan debt, including the $9,690 in SOR \u00b6 1.c, is not pursued, her debt burden would be\nreduced by more than half. Yet, it is not clear that she is in a position to make regular\npayments on her debt. In the absence of a demonstrated ability to handle her finances\nresponsibly, I am unable to conclude that she possesses the requisite good judgment\nthat must be demanded of those in a position of trust.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nSame debt as \u00b6 1.a\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nSame debt as \u00b6 1.e\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old male employee of a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of trust. He has a bachelor of science degree in information technology. He is married and has an eight-year-old daughter. He recently learned that his wife is pregnant. (Tr at 5, 47-48; Gov 1.) In June 2003, Applicant was experiencing some personal problems. He felt that he was never appreciated at work or by his wife and daughter. In order to relieve stress, Applicant began to have sexual fantasies involving young girls. This lead to Applicant exposing himself to young teenage girls on two occasions. The first incident involved a girl between the age of 13-15. He was not arrested for this offense. The second incident occurred a few days later. He saw a 13 year-old girl walking. He drove his car up the street, got out of the car and waited for the girl to walk by. When she walked by, Applicant called to her in order to get her attention. When she looked in his direction, he exposed his lower torso to her. The girl ran away and the Applicant got into his car and drove away. (Tr at 54-55; Gov 2.)

On October 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior, for Applicant. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within \nthe Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 2, 2007.  He answered \nthe SOR in writing on December 21, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on January 2, 2008. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 25, 2008, and I received the case \n \n1 \n \nApril 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nassignment on February 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 11, 2008,    \nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 26, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, called one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 9, 2008. The record \nclosed on that date. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition, \nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old male employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nwho is seeking a position of trust. He has a bachelor of science degree in information \ntechnology. He is married and has an eight-year-old daughter.  He recently learned that his \nwife is pregnant. (Tr at 5, 47-48; Gov 1.) \n \nIn June 2003, Applicant was experiencing some personal problems. He felt that he \nwas never appreciated at work or by his wife and daughter. In order to relieve stress, \nApplicant began to have sexual fantasies involving young girls. This lead to Applicant \nexposing himself to young teenage girls on two occasions. The first incident involved a girl \nbetween the age of 13-15. He was not arrested for this offense. The second incident \noccurred a few days later.  He saw a 13 year-old girl walking. He drove his car up the \nstreet, got out of the car and waited for the girl to walk by. When she walked by, Applicant \ncalled to her in order to get her attention. When she looked in his direction, he exposed his \nlower torso to her.  The girl ran away and the Applicant got into his car and drove away. (Tr \nat 54-55; Gov 2.) \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant was contacted by a private investigator who was \ninvestigating a charge of indecent exposure. The victim had memorized the license plate \nnumber of Applicant\u2019s car which was registered to his mother-in-law. The following day, \nApplicant was arrested at his place of employment. (Gov 2.)  \n \nOn July 18, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Indecency with a Child \nBy Exposure.  On June 3, 2004, Applicant pled guilty to the charge. He was placed on five \nyears supervised probation from June 3, 2004 to June 3, 2009. He was ordered to register \nas a sex offender and ordered to attend psychological treatment. He paid a total of $3,007 \nin fines and court costs and completed 400 hours community service. (Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov \n4.) The sex offender registry lists Applicant\u2019s risk level as moderate. (Gov 4.) \n   \nOn October 10, 2004, Applicant started his court-ordered sex offender treatment \nprogram. The first phase of the treatment is known as (the intensive phase) and consists of \nthe participant attending a weekly group meeting, and a monthly individual meeting with his \ncounselor.  He completed the first phase of the treatment on January 21, 2007.  The \n\n \n3 \n \nsecond phase of the treatment is considered the maintenance phase and lasts about two \nyears. Applicant is required to attend two monthly meetings. One is a group meeting. The \nother is an individual meeting with his counselor. When Applicant reaches the third phase, \nhe is required to meet with his therapist every three months.  (Tr at 18-19, 52-53; Gov 2.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s therapist testified during the hearing. He is Licensed Master Social \nWorker who has worked with sex offenders since early 1980. The program Applicant \nattends takes about four to five years to complete and involves cognitive behavioral \ntherapy. Applicant has accepted total responsibility for his behavior and has successfully \nparticipated in the program. He has learned to identify risk factors, and how to intervene \nand successfully avoid future similar behavior. Applicant\u2019s prognosis is excellent for \ncontinued compliance in the program. He describes Applicant as a \u201csituational sex \noffender\u201d as opposed to a person who has a deviant sexual attraction to children.  The \ntherapist testified that his evaluation is not a psychological or psychiatric evaluation.  \nApplicant is currently in the maintenance phase of treatment. The maintenance phase is \nsupposed to reinforce the techniques learned during the intensive phase. His observations \nindicate that Applicant is using the techniques that he learned.  Nationwide there is an 80% \nsuccess rate in the program. In the therapist\u2019s opinion, it is unlikely that Applicant will \nreoffend. Applicant has demonstrated that he has everything he needs to lead a deviant \nfree life.  He cannot guarantee that Applicant will never reoffend.  When asked about the \nfact that Applicant\u2019s risk level was described as \u201cmoderate\u201d on the sex offender registry, \nApplicant\u2019s therapist said that he was not familiar with the standards the court applies to \nassess the risk level.(Tr at 16-46.)    \n \nOn the advice of his attorney, Applicant saw a psychologist for a few months prior to \nhis court date. The psychologist concluded Applicant was suffering from depression, \nanxiety, and stress. He was not prescribed any medication. He stopped seeing the \npsychologist because he thought he was wasting his time. (Tr at 61-63.)  \n \nApplicant does not know whether his neighbors are aware that he is registered sex \noffender. He would be embarrassed if they knew. He does not go around telling people \nunless required but he has accepted responsibility for his past actions. He has lost some \nfriends based on the offense. His relatives know of the offense. He admits that what he did \nwas wrong and he is trying to change his life. (TR 58-60, 63.)  \n \nSo far, Applicant has complied with all the terms and conditions of his sentence and \nprobation. His probation does not end until June 3, 2009. (Tr at 52.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  AThe standard that must be met for . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person=s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See Regulation & \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \n\n \n4 \n \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply \nto cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \n \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are three Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) that apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. They are CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses); CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted); and CC DC   \n\u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation). Applicant admits to two incidents of \nexposing himself to young teenage girls. He was prosecuted for the second incident. He \npled and was found guilty of Indecent Acts with a Child by Exposure. He is currently on \nprobation. His probation will not end until June 3, 2009.  \n \nThe criminal conduct concern can be mitigated. I find that it is premature to apply \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since \nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) because Applicant is still serving the terms of his probation.  Although Applicant \nhas not been arrested or charged with an offense since July 2003, the serious nature of the \noffense, the fact that Applicant was a mature adult at the time of the offense, and the fact \nthat he committed the offense on two occasions leads me to conclude that insufficient time \nhas elapsed before CC MC \u00b6 32(a) can be applied.  \n \nIt is premature to apply CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement) because Applicant remains on probation until June \n2009.  It is noted that he has made progress through his court-ordered counseling program, \nand has followed all the terms of probation so far.  \n \nAt this time, it is premature to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the criminal \nconduct concern. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the sexual behavior guideline is set forth in \u00b6 12 \nof the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \n \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \n \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress \n \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \n \nto protect classified information. No adverse inference concerning the \n \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \n \norientation of the individual.  \n \n   \n \nThere are several Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions (SB DC) that apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual \nhas been prosecuted) applies. Applicant admits to two incidents of indecent exposure both \ninvolving a young teenage girl.  Both of these incidents were criminal in nature.   \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress) applies. Applicant\u2019s actions make him vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  He admitted that he is embarrassed by his past behavior. \nWhile he indicates that he discloses his past behavior when he is required, there is still a \npotential for a situation to arise where Applicant would not want his past arrest and sexual \nconduct disclosed which makes him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment) applies.  Applicant exposed himself on two separate occasions to \nminor teenage girls on a public street. His conduct was sexual behavior of a public nature  \nand reveals a lack of discretion or judgment. \n \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. It alleges that Applicant received \ntreatment at a sex offender program. Attending a sex offender treatment program is not \nsexual behavior. Attending treatment is a positive development and represents good \njudgment by Applicant even though the treatment is court-ordered. No disqualifying \nconditions apply.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising under sexual behavior. The following Sexual Behavior \nMitigating Conditions (SB MC) have the potential to apply: \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable.  \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant admits to two incidents of indecent exposure. The victim in each instance was a \nminor teenage girl. Although several years have passed since his arrest and he has actively \nparticipated in his court-ordered therapy, it is premature to apply SB DC \u00b6 14(b) because \nApplicant is still serving probation.   \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 14c (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress) cannot be applied. While Applicant has disclosed the nature of his offense to family \nmembers and other friends who need to know, he remains embarrassed about his past \nsexual conduct. Due to the sensitive nature of Applicant\u2019s past behavior, there is always a \npotential that Applicant may be subject to coercion, exploitation or duress. SB DC \u00b6 14c \ndoes not apply.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant made progress through his court-ordered therapy, it is too soon \nto conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under Sexual Behavior.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): A(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.@ Under AG & 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was 35-years-old when he \ncommitted these offenses. The offenses reveal a lack of judgment and discretion. While he \nshould be commended for the progress that he has made in his therapy sessions, he \nremains on probation until June 2009.  Not enough time has passed to conclude that \nApplicant is fully rehabilitated. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under \ncriminal conduct and sexual behavior.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on December 7, 2005. On December 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing on \nthe administrative record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on February 12, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on February 19, \n2008. Applicant signed a receipt for the FORM on March 14, 2008. Applicant had 30 \ndays from the receipt of the FORM to file a response. She did not submit a response. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 9, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJune 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nAdministrative Notice is taken of four documents submitted by the Government in \nthe FORM.  Several of the documents have been updated with the most recent version \nof the report as referenced below.    \n \nThe Kingdom of Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. From 1996 until the 2006 \npeaceful coup, the country was a functioning democracy with constitutional changes of \ngovernment. Generally free and fair multi-party elections held in December 2007 \nsubsequently restored Democratic governance. The King has been given little direct \npower under Thailand\u2019s constitution but is a symbol of national identity and unity. (U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: \nThailand, March 2008, at 5.)  \n \nThe U.S. and Thailand have a close relationship, as reflected by several bilateral \ntreaties. Thailand has cooperated with the U.S. on a wide variety of diplomatic and \nforeign policy issues. However, as a result of the 2006 military coup, the U.S. \nsuspended foreign military financing, international military education training funds, and \npeace-keeping operation program with Thailand.  Funding for these programs resumed \nafter a democratically elected government took office in February 2008. As part of their \nmutual defense cooperation over the last decade, Thailand and the U.S. have \ndeveloped a vigorous joint military exercise program, which engages the services of \neach nation and averages 40 joint exercises per year. (U.S. Department of State, \nBureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: Thailand, March 2008, at 8; \nCRS Report for Congress, Thailand: Background and U.S. Relations, October 2, 2006.) \n \nThe Thai government\u2019s overall human rights record raise some issues dealing \nwith excessive use of force by security forces, including extrajudicial, arbitrary, and \nunlawful killings. The interim government maintained some limits on freedom of speech, \nfreedom of press and freedom of assembly.  Thailand remains a source, and destination \nfor trafficking in persons for a variety of purposes, including indentured servitude, forced \nlabor, and prostitution. (U.S. Department of State, Thailand, country Reports on Human \nRights Practices \u2013 2007, March 11, 2008, at 1.)  \n \nThere is a concern of an increased risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia. American \ncitizens traveling to Thailand are urged to exercise caution and remain vigilant regarding \ntheir personal security. They should avoid crowds and demonstrations. (U.S. \nDepartment of State, Consular Information Sheet, Thailand, February 23, 2007, at 2.)  \n \nThailand\u2019s southern region is fraught with violence attributed to armed local \nseparatist/extremist groups between Muslim insurgents and Thailand\u2019s security forces. \nWhile extremist groups primarily focus on Thai government interests in south Thailand, \nrecent violence has also targeted public places, including tourist areas. On-going \nconflicts and criminal incidents have occurred in the remote areas along the border with \n\n \n3 \n \n \nBurma and in Thailand\u2019s northern an eastern borders with Laos. (U.S. Department of \nState, Consular Information Sheet, Thailand, February 23, 2007, at 2-3.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated January 11, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old export administrator employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor who is applying for a security clearance. She has worked for her \ncurrent employer since September 2005. The highest level of education she achieved is \na master\u2019s degree. She is married and has one son, age 14. This is her first application \nfor a security clearance. (Gov 4.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Thailand. She moved to the United States in \nSeptember 1987 to attend graduate school. Her husband was born and raised in \nThailand. Applicant and her husband became U.S. citizens on August 26, 2002. \n(Answer to SOR, Gov 5; Gov 4.) She possesses a U.S. passport which was issued on \nSeptember 18, 2002, and expires on September 17, 2012. (Gov 6 at 6-19.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens of and reside in Thailand. Her parents-\nin-law are also citizens of and reside in Thailand.  Her mother is retired. Her sister \nmanages an apartment complex. Both of her parents-in-law are retired. Her father-in-\nlaw worked part-time recruiting teachers for an international school located in Thailand \nbut now is retired full-time. (Gov 4, section 14/15; Gov 6 at 39, 45) Applicant traveled to \nThailand in October 1998 for three weeks with her son and husband to visit relatives. \nFrom July 1999 to August 1999, she traveled to Thailand with her son to visit her ill \nfather. She and her family traveled to Thailand from December 2000 to January 2001 \nfor three weeks to visit family members. In May 2001, she and her family traveled to \nThailand for two weeks to attend her father\u2019s funeral. From December 2005 to January \n2006, she and her family traveled to Thailand to visit family members. (Answer to SOR; \nGov 6 at 40, 45.)  \n \nApplicant possesses a valid Thai passport which was issued to her on July 20, \n1999. It initially had an expiration date of July 19, 2004. Applicant extended the passport \nuntil July 19, 2009. (Gov 6 at 20-36, 39-40; Answer to SOR.) She and her husband \npurchased two rental properties in Thailand prior to becoming U.S. citizens. The \nproperties were purchased for investment purposes. One property is worth $24,200. \nThe property is rented out for $175 a month. The other property is worth $28,500. The \nproperty is rented out for $225 a month. Her mother manages one property. Her sister \nmanages the other property. The rent money is deposited into a bank account to be \nused by Applicant\u2019s mother for her expenses and for maintaining the properties. (Gov 6 \nat 3-4.)  \n \n Applicant indicated that foreigners are not allowed to own property in Thailand. \nShe maintains her Thai passport in order to deal with Thai officials pertaining to the two \n\n \n4 \n \n \nproperties and in order to assist with claiming any inheritance after her mother passes \naway. (Answer to SOR; Gov 6 at 39-40.)  She indicated that she was willing to \nsurrender her Thai passport and renounce her Thai citizenship but was reluctant to do \nso because she thought she would lose the two rental properties as well as any \npotential inheritance located in Thailand from her mother. (Gov 6 at 40.)  \n \nApplicant says that the United States is her home. She is patriotic and a \nresponsible citizen. (Answer to SOR; see also Gov 6 at 40.)  Most of her family\u2019s assets \nare located within the United States. (Gov 6 at 47-51.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) \u00b610(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport, (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial \nor business interests in another country); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant has a valid \nThai passport. She obtained the Thai passport on July 20, 1999, prior to her U.S. \ncitizenship. However, she applied for an extension of her Thai passport on July 6, 2004, \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen. Her Thai passport does not expire until July 19, 2009.  \nShe maintains a valid Thai passport in order to protect two rental properties that she \nand her husband own in Thailand.  It is her understanding that foreigners are not \nallowed to own property in Thailand.  She is also concerned about not being able to \nclaim a potential inheritance when her mother passes away.  Applicant\u2019s possession \nand use of a Thai passport is an exercise of her rights as a Thai citizen.     \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) are relevant to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) does not apply. While Applicant was born and raised in Thailand, she \nexercised dual citizenship by applying for an extension of her Thai passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in August 2002.  She maintains her Thai passport in order to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprotect property interests in Thailand.  She understands that only Thai citizens can own \nproperty in Thailand.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) applies. During her background investigation, Applicant indicated that she \nwas willing to renounce her Thai citizenship. However, she expressed reservations \nabout doing so pertaining to protecting her property interests located in Thailand. As \nsuch, this mitigating condition is given less weight.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual \nwas a minor) does not apply.  Applicant continued to exercise her rights as a Thai \ncitizen by maintaining a valid Thai passport after becoming a U.S. citizen.  She did so in \norder to maintain her status as a Thai citizen so that she is able to own and inherit \nproperty in Thailand.   \n  \nFP MC \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority) is not applicable. There is nothing to indicate this mitigating condition applies \nto this case.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) does not apply. The record evidence \nindicates that Applicant was willing to surrender her Thai passport with reservations. \nHowever, there is nothing in the record evidence indicating that Applicant took steps to \nsurrender, destroy, or invalidate her Thai passport.  \n \nAt the close of the record, the Applicant still possesses a valid Thai passport. Her \nrefusal to surrender to her foreign passport indicates a preference for her home country. \nShe has not mitigated the Foreign Preference security concerns. Guideline C is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies as a result of \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and parents-in-law, who are citizens of and reside in \nThailand. She is close to her family members who reside in Thailand. FI DC \u00b6 7(b) \n(connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by \nproviding that information) applies for the same reason.   \n \nFI DC & 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence of exploitation) was raised due to \nApplicant\u2019s ownership interest in two rental properties located in Thailand. While most of \nApplicant\u2019s assets are in the U.S., she maintains a valid Thai passport in order to \nprotect her ownership interest in these properties.  These properties are of some \nimportance to her as indicated by her refusal to surrender or invalidate her Thai \npassport.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. \n \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the \nrelationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the \nposition or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) \napplies.  Although Thailand has its issues, it has a strong relationship with the U.S.  \nApplicant\u2019s relatives are not connected with the government.  It is unlikely that Applicant \nwill be placed in a position to choose between the interests of her relatives and the \ninterests of the U.S.  \n \n FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant is close to her relatives who reside in \nThailand, she has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years. Her immediate family resides in \nthe U.S.  Most of her assets are in the U.S.  Her son was born in the U.S.  It is likely that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nshe will resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. based on her long history of \nresiding in the U.S.    \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with her family members who live \nand reside in Thailand cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  She and her family \nhave traveled numerous times to Thailand to visit family members. She is close to her \nfamily members.   \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the individual) is not applicable \nbecause Applicant is not willing to surrender her Thai passport. She intends to maintain \nher Thai passport in order to protect her property interests in Thailand.  Her actions \nindicate that she has a strong interest in maintaining these properties. \n \nWhile security concerns raised regarding Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of \nand reside in Thailand are mitigate, concerns remain pertaining to Applicant\u2019s interest in \nmaintaining her foreign property interests.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \npertaining to her work performance. While Applicant\u2019s relatives in Thailand do not pose \na security concern, an issue remains pertaining to her possession of a valid Thai \npassport.  She maintains the Thai passport in order to prove her Thai citizenship which \nallows her to own property in her home country. Foreign preference and foreign \ninfluence concerns are not mitigated. Applicant is not willing to surrender her foreign \npassport out of concerns for protecting her property interests located in Thailand.   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 4, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to her evidence\nof mitigation, and she points out the negative impact that an adverse security clearance decision will\nhave on her job and her ability to pay her debts. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: The SOR alleges $42,482 in\ndelinquent debts, and Applicant admitted almost all the allegations.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor as to three of the debts.  Applicant attributes many of her financial difficulties to her second\nhusband\u2019s job loss and his ensuing emotional problems.  Applicant\u2019s husband filed for bankruptcy\nin 2005, but Applicant did not join in the petition because she did not want to jeopardize her security\nclearance.  In October 2007, Applicant enrolled in a debt consolidation program with a down\npayment of $500.  At that time, Applicant was unable to begin the prescribed payments of $300 per\nmonth to pay down her debts, but was scheduled to do so as of October 31, 2008, just after the\nhearing.  Applicant also hired a credit service firm to challenge the amount and validity of her debts.\nThat service charged $80 per month and completed its process in August 2008.  In November 2006,\nApplicant had $31.30 a month left after all her expenses.  She now has $400 left due to salary\nincreases, and she has developed a budget with help from a counselor at her church.  Applicant\nsubmitted several character reference letters.\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to her\nevidence of mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23, 2008).\nApplicant points out that an adverse security clearance decision will cause her to lose her job\nand will hinder her ability to continue to improve her financial situation.  An applicant is not made\nmore or less suitable for a security clearance based on how the Judge\u2019s decision might affect the\napplicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21012 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2005).\nIn this case, the Judge discussed the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F.  Looking at both the favorable and unfavorable record evidence, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation did not overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable decision is sustainable.\n\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jean E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling $42,482.00 under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant essentially admitted all the allegations. Her denial of a student loan debt in SOR 1.b. is based on a consolidation offer the Government made to her recently where all four past due loans were placed in one repayment plan. Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR 1.n. is based on her claim she paid the debt. SOR 1.t. and 1.u. refer to the same debt, and are found in Applicant\u2019s favor based on the documentation provided to show the debt was paid (AE CC). Applicant has been employed as an industrial coordinator with her employer since December 2002. She seeks a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s first marriage in July 1983 ended in divorce in February 1999. Applicant encountered federal tax problems beginning in 1996. Applicant\u2019s second marriage began in December 2001 (GE 1). However, her 1 husband\u2019s layoff from his airline employer after September 11, 2001 created emotional problems her husband could not resolve, and the marriage could not survive. Applicant separated from her husband and has been living by herself in August 2004 (Tr. 84). She points to the problems of her second husband, e.g., depression, and his failure to look for work (Tr. 101), as two of the reasons she still has financial problems.

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on June 2, 2008 by facsimile. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on October 3, 2008, and the hearing was held on October 27,\n2008. At the hearing, six exhibits (GE 1 through 6) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits\n(AE A through AE V). In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish additional\ndocumentation, she submitted AE W through AE FF, which were received in evidence\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n However, in GE 3 Applicant indicated she married her second husband in 2000.\n1\n2\nwithout objection. These exhibits contain position statements, federal tax documents,\nrevised credit information showing that several listed creditors were no longer reporting,\nand character evidence about Applicant. DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.) of\nthe proceedings on November 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling $42,482.00 under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. Applicant essentially admitted all the allegations. Her denial of\na student loan debt in SOR 1.b. is based on a consolidation offer the Government made\nto her recently where all four past due loans were placed in one repayment plan.\nApplicant\u2019s denial of SOR 1.n. is based on her claim she paid the debt. SOR 1.t. and\n1.u. refer to the same debt, and are found in Applicant\u2019s favor based on the\ndocumentation provided to show the debt was paid (AE CC). \nApplicant has been employed as an industrial coordinator with her employer\nsince December 2002. She seeks a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s first marriage in July 1983 ended in divorce in February 1999.\nApplicant encountered federal tax problems beginning in 1996. \nApplicant\u2019s second marriage began in December 2001 (GE 1).  However, her\n1\nhusband\u2019s layoff from his airline employer after September 11, 2001 created emotional\nproblems her husband could not resolve, and the marriage could not survive. Applicant\nseparated from her husband and has been living by herself in August 2004 (Tr. 84). She\npoints to the problems of her second husband, e.g., depression, and his failure to look\nfor work (Tr. 101), as two of the reasons she still has financial problems. Her second\nhusband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 that she did not join because she did not\nwant to jeopardize her security clearance (Tr. 44-46). Applicant indicated she was not in\na position to pay these debts until the last six months (2007) because her husband had\na mental breakdown after the bankruptcy, and they lost their home (Tr. 45).\nIn October 2007 Applicant enrolled in a debt consolidation organization with a\n$500.00-down payment on October and November 2007 (GE 3; Tr. 97). However,\nbecause of the rise in energy prices and maintaining her mortgage (Tr. 99), she has not\nbegun the monthly payments of $300.00. She is scheduled to begin the payments on\nOctober 31, 2008 (Id.). Under the plan she is to pay $300.00 a month until the target\nfigure of $2980.00 is reached, then certain debts in the plan will be eliminated or\nforgiven (Tr. 96). No additional information was provided. Applicant also signed up with\na credit service firm to challenge debts for validity and amount (Tr. 90; GE 3). That\nservice, which cost her about $80.00 a month, completed the list of disputed creditors\nand debt amounts in August 2008 (Tr. 98). \n\n3\nApplicant began a part-time job in June 2008 that concluded in the middle of\nNovember 2008. Her payment stubs appear in AE AA. She is scheduled to begin a new\npart-time job on November 21, 2008, and will be working out of her house (AE W). \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the Government in November 2006, her\nmonthly remainder was about $31.30, but her monthly remainder currently is about\n$400.00 due to salary increases (Tr. 103). Applicant testified that based on the advice of\nher church counselor she is using a monthly budget to maintain better accountability\nover her expenses (Tr. 104). She submitted AE X as her budget. The one page exhibit\ndated November 3, 2008, is a list of her monthly expenses, but does not provide\ninformation about other elements of her budget. \nThe delinquent debts will be discussed in the order they appear in the SOR. The\ndebts became delinquent at different times between July 1999 and 2007. Applicant\ntestified she made sporadic payments on the debts in 2008 but few payments in 2007\nbecause she had to meet a state requirement of working through the divorce (Tr. 83-\n84). No additional information was provided. In addition, she stressed that she had to\nmake several sacrifices in starting her life anew in 2007 (Tr. 83-84; AE W).\nSOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.l., and 1.m. These four debts are delinquent student loans\ntotaling $19,714.00. The loans were opened in March 2004. The last activity on the\naccounts was June 2005. Applicant testified she paid about $5,000.00 on the loans over\nthe years, but has made no payments since 2006 (Tr. 81). She entered into the revised\nstudent loan payback plan (containing all four student loans) in May 2008, and made\nher first monthly payment of $200.00 in October 2008 as required (Tr. 82; AE C, AE Y).\nThis paragraph is resolved against Applicant. \nSOR 1.c. The last activity on this personal loan account ($124.00) was in May\n1999. Applicant admitted this account and explained it would be in her payment plan\nwhich apparently was formulated (Tr. 48). Applicant requested a research of this debt\nby one of the credit agencies. She was informed on August 29, 2008 that the debt is no\nlonger being reported by the creditor (AE BB). This allegation is resolved against\nApplicant.\nSOR 1.d., 1.e. These two allegations refer to two checks that were returned to\nApplicant due to insufficient funds to cover the checks to purchase food at a national\ngrocer. The value of the checks is $124.00. The checks were written in July 1999. AE\nBB reflects that the creditor is no longer reporting the debts. Applicant agreed she still is\nresponsible for the checks, and stated they would be a part of her payback plan (Tr. 48-\n49). These two allegations are resolved against Applicant. \nSOR 1.f. The last activity for this collection account of $88.00 was December\n2000 (GE 6). Applicant acknowledged she owes the overdue debt. This account is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. AE BB reflects the creditor is no longer reporting the\naccount. I find against Applicant under this account. \n\n4\nSOR 1.g. The services for this medical account of $288.00 were rendered on\nMarch 2002 (GE 4, 6), and placed for collection in July 2002. AE CC contains a one-\npage document from a local hospital (See, SOR 2.t.) and the remaining documentation\nfrom a systems/account inquiry records system relating to medical services rendered at\nanother, undisclosed location. Though several pages show a zero balance for medical\nservices performed, the documentation reflects that the medical services were\nperformed from January 1997 to April 2001. There is no documentation reflecting that\nshe received medical services in March 2002, the date identified in the allegation and\ncredit reports (GE 5, GE 6). I find Applicant has not established this account has been\npaid. \nSOR 1.h. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) federal tax lien ($6,602.00) was\nfiled against Applicant in August 2003 and applies to tax years 1996 and 1997. When\nApplicant was with her husband in 1996, she was making regular payments to the IRS\nfor unpaid taxes. When she separated, she could no longer make payments, and was\nput in a suspended status for the last five years (Tr. 94-95). Any refund Applicant is\nentitled is being withheld by the IRS to pay down the lien (Id.). According to AE P1, the\noutstanding balance as of March 2008 was $5913.00. This allegation is resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant resolved her delinquent state tax obligation (unlisted) in\n2007 (GE 3).\nSOR 1.i. According to Applicant (Tr. 87), this account ($11,488.00) should be\nreduced to $1,999.00 to correctly reflect the deficiency balance after the auto was sold\nat an auction. Applicant believed this debt was discharged in her husband\u2019s Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. A review of the AE FF, a partial copy of an undated motion entitled\nAMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 7 SCHEDULES, lists five creditors. Neither the SOR 1.h.\nnor the SOR 1.q. creditors are listed in the incomplete motion documents. See also, AE\nW and AE BB. I find against Applicant under this allegation. \nSOR 1.j. The delinquent account is $336.00, according to GE 6. The last activity\non the debt was in May 2002. In her answers to interrogatories (GE 3), Applicant stated\nshe would settle the debt by January 2008. Applicant claimed the debt belonged to her\nhusband. She has not paid this account.\nSOR 1.k. The account ($288.00) is a collection debt for a utility. The last activity\non the account was January 2005. In GE 2, Applicant stated the company would accept\npayments on this account until paid in full. No additional information was provided. This\nallegation is resolved against Applicant. \nSOR 1.n. Applicant claims she paid this account ($66.00)and destroyed the\nreceipt. She tried to retrieve the receipt, but has been unsuccessful to this as of the date\nof the hearing (Tr. 53). The allegation is resolved against Applicant. \nSOR 1.o. This is a credit card account for $220.00. Applicant indicated in GE 2\nand her testimony (Tr. 54) that she reached a settlement with the creditor, and the next\n\n5\naction was to pay the figure (Tr. 54). No additional information was provided as to\nwhether the settlement was paid. Applicant is still responsible for this account. \nSOR 1.p. Applicant admitted this account ($501.00) but disputed the amount with\nthe assistance of a credit assistance law firm. She learned the debt amount is accurate,\nand is no longer disputing the amount (Tr. 90-91). Applicant is still liable for this\naccount. \nSOR 1.q. This account ($1,999.00) is owned by the creditor who had a lien on\nthe auto described in SOR 1.i. Though Applicant considered the two allegations referred\nto the same debt (Tr. 87), she also acknowledged they might represent different debts.\nAE N2 dated March 2008, reflects the debt has increased. Applicant is still responsible\nfor this account. \nSOR 1.r. This delinquent account amounts to $330.00. In GE 3, Applicant\nadvised the account was being disputed. Applicant is no longer disputing the account,\nand is responsible for the past due debt.\nSOR 1.s. According to GE 3, Applicant considered this account ($544.00) to be a\ndouble entry that was being disputed. She presented no additional evidence. This\naccount is resolved against Applicant. \nSOR 1.t., 1.u. Both allegations refer to the same delinquent debt for medical\nservices. The medical account was paid on September 16, 2008 (AE CC). These two\naccounts are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe total number of debts is reduced by one to 20, as the SOR 1.u. medical debt\n($50.00) was entered twice in the list of delinquent debts appearing in the SOR. The\ntotal amount of past due debt is $35,426.00.\nCharacter Evidence\nSeveral character statements were admitted in evidence. AE H is from the\nproject coordinator who has known Applicant professionally for several years. In 2006\nand 2007, Applicant was a security officer in the project coordinator\u2019s office. Applicant\u2019s\ndedication to a secure environment provided repose for all employees working in the\noffice.\nThe information technician (IT) has worked with Applicant for five years, and\nbelieves she is dependable and reliable. The IT opines that Applicant is very security\nconscious (AE I). \nThe personnel security specialist has known Applicant as a coworker and a friend\nfor a year. Applicant advised the security specialist she was trying to pay her overdue\ndebts in good faith. \n\n6\nThe senior project manager wrote a character statement (GE 2) and testified\nabout Applicant. He indicated that Applicant has demonstrated honesty and\ntrustworthiness in the 2 \u00bd years he has known her (Tr. 38). He is aware she has\nfinancial problems but he does not know what she has done (Tr. 39).\nThe associate facility security officer provided a written character statement (GE\n2), and also testified about Applicant. The officer highlighted Applicant\u2019s security\nresponsibilities include (1) ensuring that all attendees at the 12 government\nsymposiums have the proper badges, and (2) that all classified information is monitored\nat all times, (3) and that all security rules in the transfer of secured information are\nconducted appropriately. Since being reassigned to unclassified responsibilities,\nApplicant has excelled at tracking classified information that is transferred to the\ngovernment or other contractors (Tr. 31).\nApplicant received several certificates of recognition or training in AE EE,\nincluding an acknowledgment in 2004 of her security support by the lab division of her\nemployer. Applicant received her notary seal in March 2007. In August 2008, Applicant\nreceived a certificate for two days of training on certain software. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n7\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nApplicant encountered tax problems in 1996 when she was married to her first\nhusband. She testified she was involved in a payment agreement with the IRS for\nunpaid taxes. The credit reports reflect corresponding tax problems with the state tax\nagency. The credit reports also show that the debts listed in the SOR became\ndelinquent between 1999 and 2007. The age and amount of overdue debt brings\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems within the scope of FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a.\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial\nobligations).\nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that have potential application to this\ncase. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) is not\napplicable. The IRS lien, which was filed in August 2003, covers tax problems that\nsurfaced in 1996 and/or more recently. The insufficient funds checks occurred in 1999,\nand may be no longer enforceable. On the other hand, there are at least three overdue\ndebts that fell delinquent in 2006, less than three years ago. There are 20 debts that are\nstill delinquent. Though Applicant spent $500.00 in October 2007 to enroll in the debt\nservices program, and was informed she would be paying $300.00 a month under the\n\n8\nplan, she has not paid her first monthly installment. She paid approximately $80.00 a\nmonth to have the credit services firm challenge debts for accuracy. Yet, the only\nsignificant payments she has made on her debts were the involuntary payments to IRS,\nand a $200.00 payment on the student loan after neglecting to pay the debt for about\nthree years. Applicant\u2019s decision not to pay the smaller debts, even after her official\nchallenge of certain debts ended in August 2007, precludes the application of FC MC\n20.a. \nApplicant gains some benefit from FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), as her former husband and her current husband\n(she is separated from) bear some blame for her financial problems. Her first husband\ncontributed to her tax problems with the IRS, leading to the lien being filed in August\n2003 for taxes owed in 1996. Applicant ran into marital discord following September\n2001, when her current husband lost his job and developed mental problems. \nApplicant exercised good judgment by separating from her current husband in\nAugust 2004, after concluding she could no longer live him with his mental condition.\nAnd, she receives mitigation for that period. However, FC MC 20.b. also calls for the\nindividual to act responsibly under the circumstances by continuing to handle their\naffairs in a responsible manner. Four years have passed and Applicant owes more than\n$35,000.00 to 20 creditors. If she did not know before October 2007 that she owed\nseveral creditors, during that month, she was informed by the Government that she\nowed the listed creditors. She provided lengthy explanations of the debts, and, in\nseveral responses, indicated she would pay several of the creditors in early 2008. The\nrecord reflects only one of the smaller debts was paid. Even though Applicant faced an\nunanticipated situation with her husband, she only receives limited mitigation under FC\nMC 20.b. by not paying more of the smaller creditors when she had the opportunity,\nparticularly in the last six months. Her claim she did not pay the smaller debts because\nof the increasing cost of energy in the last year is not mitigating. Considering her part-\ntime employment since June 2008, her increased energy costs should not have\nprevented her from paying these smaller debts. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies in part based on Applicant\u2019s good judgment in enrolling in a debt service and\ncredit review service. However, the large number of overdue debts makes it impossible\nfor me to conclude Applicant\u2019s problems are being resolved or are under control. \nPaying a debt service a credit review service more than $800.00 does not\nprovide the same mitigation as actually paying the creditors. Nonetheless, FC MC 20.d.\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) receives some consideration in Applicant\u2019s favor, as she incurred a large\ndebt with the debt and credit review service. However, she has made only one payment\non her consolidated student loan since 2006, and that payment was in October 2008.\nOther than the one $50.00 medical debt and her payments to IRS, Applicant presented\n\n9\nno documented proof of payment of any of the other debts. The mitigation provided by\nFC MC 20.d. is limited due to the lack of a sustained record of payments other than to\nthe IRS. \nFC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue) applies to bona fide disputes. I am unable to discern whether or not Applicant\nhad a good faith dispute with any of the creditors. Applicant admitted the debts. None of\nthe debts were removed from her credit report because they were false or erroneous.\nThese two facts subvert the credibility of Applicant\u2019s dispute claims. The removal of\ndebts listed in SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. from Applicant\u2019s credit report is due to the\nfact that the time period in which the creditors could get a judgment in court against\nApplicant has expired. In addition, Applicant admitted the debts. Based on the totality of\nall the record evidence, including her favorable job performance and security\nconsciousness, Applicant does not prevail under the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of the all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had two marriages that\nburdened her with tax and debt problems. Some of the debts became delinquent in\n1999. Some of the debt fell delinquent in 2004, and some reached the delinquent status\nin 2006. She informed the Government in October 2007 she paid a debt service to\nconsolidate her debt. She also advised the Government of the credit review service to\nevaluate her debts for accuracy. Yet, she did little to pay even some of the 10 smaller\ndebts covered in the SOR. While her action regarding the IRS debt weighs in her favor\nbecause she has developed a record of paying down the deficiency, she has only paid\n$200.00 on the education debt since 2006.   \nApplicant has a successful job performance evaluation for the 2007 appraisal\nperiod, and is considered to be a very responsible security official by her former\nsupervisor and her employee\u2019s facility security officer. The respect the two individuals\n\n10\nhave for Applicant is commendable, but they also were largely uninformed about\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. Moreover, an individual who seeks a security clearance\nhas to show the same vigilance in their personal affairs as they do in conducting their\nsecurity responsibilities. Failing to achieve a successful control on her financial\nindebtedness during Applicant\u2019s uninterrupted employment since December 2002,\nraises lingering questions about her security suitability which she has not overcome.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\ndifficulties. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l\n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nOn August 20, 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions (SF 85P) to request eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position  involving access to\n1\nsensitive information as part of her employment with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n2\nApplicant\u2019s request. On February 11, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nNovember 19, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n I excluded Gx. 4 because they it not meet the authentication requirements of Directive Enclosure 3, \u00b6\n4\nE3.1.20. (Tr. 23 - 30)\n2\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E\n3\n(personal conduct).\nOn April 7, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 9, 2008, and I convened a hearing on September 4,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented nine exhibits\n(Gx. 1 - 9).  Applicant testified in her own behalf and offered one exhibit admitted\n4\nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) A. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nSeptember 18, 2008. I left the record open after the hearing to allow Applicant time to\nsubmit additional relevant information. The record closed on October 1, 2008, when I\nreceived Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission via Department Counsel. It has been\nadmitted without objection as Ax. B.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged Applicant owed approximately\n$24,564 for 37 delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.kk. Applicant admitted without\nexplanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p, 1.r, 1.w - 1.y, and 1.ee - 1.ii. She denied\nwithout explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.s - 1.v, 1.z - 1.dd, 1.jj and 1.kk. The\ngovernment further alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ll that Applicant was charged and convicted in\n1996 of embezzlement, for which she received five years supervised probation,\nincluding three months home confinement. Applicant also denied this allegation without\nexplanation. In addition to the facts admitted through her response to the SOR, I make\nthe following findings of fact based on my review of the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits.\nApplicant is 37 years old and employed by a health care and medical insurance\ncompany contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for\nTRICARE, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military\npersonnel and their families. She has held her current position for about 12 years, and\nhas performed well in all her assigned duties. Friends and co-workers hold Applicant in\nhigh regard for her trustworthiness, hard work and reliability, and her most recent\nperformance appraisal shows she is a good worker. (Ax. B) Applicant has two children,\nages 19 and 3, by two different fathers. Her older child still lives with her and attended\ncollege for a time. But she now has a child and is working to help support herself.\nApplicant received child support for her older child until the child turned 18. She has yet\nto receive child support from the father of her younger child.\nFrom about March 1993 until about August 2002, Applicant lived with her\nboyfriend, the father of her older child, in a trailer they financed together. Applicant\u2019s\n\n Assuming the conduct occurred twice weekly for 50 weeks.\n5\n3\nboyfriend developed a gambling problem, which caused her to eventually move out in\n2002. His gambling also caused Applicant to incur delinquent debts because the\nboyfriend spent money that should otherwise have gone to supporting them both. When\nshe moved out in 2002, Applicant expected her boyfriend to continue paying on the note\nfor their mobile home, but he failed to do so and she is now at least jointly liable for a\n$10,000 debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.q) Applicant denied this SOR allegation because she feels the\nbalance owed is actually about $6,800, but could not corroborate her claim. She does\nnot contest the fact that she owes a debt to that creditor. (Tr. 44 - 45, 60)\nBefore she began working for her current employer in 1996, Applicant worked as\na bank teller. For about one year around 1995, she stole between $100 and $300 about\ntwice weekly from the automated teller machine at her branch. She was charged and\nconvicted of embezzlement and sentenced to five years probation. She also was\nordered to complete financial management and budget training. Applicant admitted at\nher hearing that this happened and that she stole because of her financial problems at\nthe time. However, she denied the corresponding SOR allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.ll) only\nbecause she claimed she did not spend a day in jail as alleged. There is no indication in\nthe record that Applicant was ever ordered to make restitution to the bank for stealing\nbetween $10,000 and $30,000.  (Tr. 75)\n5\nApplicant has owed the debt on her mobile home since about 2002, and she still\nowes numerous debts from the time she and her boyfriend were together. However,\nApplicant has continued to incur new delinquencies through poor decision making. For\nexample, the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.ee is for cable service she was unable to pay for.\nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.ff is for cable service under her name for a friend in the\nfriend\u2019s home. The friend was unable to pay for the cable service either. (Tr. 73 - 74)\nMany of the debts Applicant owes are for unpaid medical bills incurred totaling\nabout $2,475 for her younger child. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, 1.f - n) Those debts are in\ncollection and most are for less than $100 each. Applicant has implied that they should\nhave been covered by her health benefits at work. Applicant contacted the collection\nagency and was offered a repayment plan of about $336 each month. (Gx. 2) However,\nshe has been unable to make such payments. (Tr. 52 - 53)\nIn November 2007, Applicant had a negative cash flow each month. Her\nexpenses were approximately $370 more than her income. (Gx. 2) She took on a\nsecond job in May 2008, which gives her about $600 more income each month. Since\nabout August 2008, Applicant has worked with a financial advisor to organize her\nfinances and to repay her debts systematically. According to the information provided,\nApplicant has been making modest payments to some of her creditors, and her advisor\nhas been helping her correct some of the errors in her credit history. Applicant has also\nestablished a monthly budget that accounts for all of her expenses and payments. From\nthe information she provided, it appears her monthly income and her expenses are\neven. The average payment to her creditors is $30 each month. (Ax. A)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n4\nApplicant is trying to reduce her costs by looking for a place to rent for less and\nreducing her discretionary spending overall. She will have to pay for day care for her\nyounger child for at least another year, but also will have her truck paid off in early 2009,\nresulting in an extra $300 available each month.\nPolicies\nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n6\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18.\nA trustworthiness determination is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to automated sensitive information. The government bears the initial\nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to\ndeny or revoke a position of trust for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be\nable to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden,\nit then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \nA person who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nNotwithstanding the exclusion of Gx. 4, the record evidence (the government\u2019s\nexhibits, Applicant\u2019s various SOR admissions and her testimony at the hearing) is\nsufficient to support the allegations in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s denials to several SOR\nallegations were entered, not to contest the fact she owes those debts, but to take issue\nwith details about amounts owed and whether she had been able to contact the\ncreditors. Available information shows Applicant has owed numerous debts for several\nyears, that she has only recently taken tangible steps to pay or otherwise resolve her\ndebts, and that she has resorted to illegal conduct to get money to pay her expenses.\nThe foregoing requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and 19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement,\nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing\ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant has shown she is\nattacking her debts and financial problems systematically through her work with a\nfinancial counselor. This requires consideration of the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control); however, she\nhas not presented information that shows her problem is under control. Applicant also\npresented information showing some of her debt was caused by unforeseen\ncircumstances, which requires consideration of AG \u00b6 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). While the\nmobile home debt and the medical debts in collection may not have been of her own\ndoing, the record also shows she has not acted in a reasonable and responsible way\nover the past several years to address these debts. I credit Applicant with working with\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n6\na financial counselor for the past few months, but I have also considered that she has\ntaken little or no action to address her debts or improve her financial management since\nat least 2002. Despite her improved awareness of the need for prudent personal money\nmanagement, it is too soon to conclude Applicant\u2019s finances will not be a security\nconcern in the future. I conclude she has failed to overcome the adverse information\nabout her finances on which DOHA adjudicators relied when they issued the SOR. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 37 years old and is\npresumed to be a mature responsible adult. She is a reliable worker for her company\nand a devoted mother and grandmother. While she is sincere in her desire to resolve\nher financial problems, the steps she has taken are insufficient when compared to\nseveral years of unpaid debts and financial mismanagement. The fact remains, as well,\nthat as Applicant tries to repay her debts, she does not have a positive cash flow.\nFinally, her poor financial management continued even after her conviction for\nembezzlement and the requirement she complete budget and financial management\ncounseling. In short, the favorable information in her background is insufficient to\novercome the security concerns about her lengthy history of bad debt. The facts and\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s finances present an unacceptable risk were she to be\ngranted access to sensitive information. \nA fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on\n9\nApplicant\u2019s finances shows there are still doubts about her ability or willingness to\nprotect the government\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the\ngovernment.10\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.ll:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a position of trust.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline G had not been mitigated under the mitigating conditions and the whole person concept.\nIn support of that contention, Applicant argues that the Judge misstated the frequency of his\nattendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)  and the length of time he had abstained from using\n1\nalcohol,  gave insufficient weight to his mitigating evidence, and reached conclusions that were not\n2\nsupported by the record as a whole.  He also argues that the Judge\u2019s overall unfavorable conclusion\nis inconsistent with other hearing-level decisions in which applicants in ostensibly similar\ncircumstances had been granted a clearance.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments\npersuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In this instance, even if the challenged findings were changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the record evidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nTherefore, any such error would be at most harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n.1 (App.\nBd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect\nto Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern reflect a sustainable interpretation of the record evidence.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21933 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2006).\nApplicant points to several hearing-level cases which he contends support granting him a\nclearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-05903\nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions in other\nhearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close factual\n\n3\nsimilarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile his decision in this case\nwith decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25743 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJan. 10, 2008).  \u201cThe adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known\nas the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own merits\n. . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). \nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and\nconcludes that the Judge has drawn \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found\u2019\u201d under\nGuideline G and his adverse decision.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR was submitted\nto DOHA on December 26, 2007. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations and requested\na hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 18, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non January 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 21, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 7, 2008\n\n Department Counsel did voice an objection to AE 1 being considered as establishing a mitigating\n2\ncondition under an unrelated guideline or for any purpose other than what impact it might have on\nconsideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept under the terms of the Directive.  The exhibit was admitted for\nthe limited purposes as stated in the transcript. (Tr. pp. 40-41)\n2\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted thirty documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\nExhibits (AE) 1-30, and admitted into the record without objection.  The record was held\n2\nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documents in support of his case. One\ndocument with a cover letter was timely received, marked as AE 31, and admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding letter was marked as Appellate\nExhibit (App. Ex.) I, and included with the record. The transcript was received on March 4,\n2008.     \nProcedural Issues\nDepartment Counsel moved at the hearing to amend the SOR by correcting\nApplicant\u2019s listed social security number, the location of treatment alleged in subparagraph\n1.h, and the state where the Army post is located as alleged in subparagraph 1.i. Each\namendment was made on the face of the SOR without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 58 years old and has been employed by a series of defense contractors,\ncurrently as a senior budget analyst, since February 1991. He served on active duty in the\nU.S. Army from May 1970, until his retirement in May 1990. He was a Chief Warrant\nOfficer 2 when he retired and had attained the rank of Sergeant First Class (paygrade E-7)\nbefore he was selected for the warrant officer program. Applicant primarily served with\nspecial forces commands during his Army career. His awards include the Legion of Merit,\nMeritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, and\nCombat Infantryman Badge. He also earned the noncommissioned officer professional\ndevelopment ribbon, scuba diver badge, special forces tab, and master parachutist badge.\nApplicant submitted numerous letters of recommendation from supervisors,\ncoworkers, senior military officers, his wife, and one of his siblings. He also submitted\nnumerous employment performance evaluations and certificates of commendation. Those\npersons and documents overwhelmingly establish that Applicant is an exceptionally valued\nemployee who has earned a reputation as a hard-working, reliable and trustworthy\nindividual. The persons who submitted the letters of recommendation, despite being fully\naware of the SOR allegations, most strongly recommend he be allowed continued access\nto classified information. Applicant has possessed a security clearance at the top secret\nlevel since approximately 1973. With the exception of a seven-day period when he was\nbarred from the workplace following a January 2007 alcohol-related workplace incident, no\nother adverse action has been taken to revoke or downgrade his security clearance. \n\n3\nApplicant has been married since April 1975. He has four adult children from that\nmarriage. His youngest child, a 24-year-old son, is the only child still residing with Applicant\nand his wife. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed as an adjunct faculty member at a local college.\nApplicant also is employed part-time as an adjunct faculty member at a local college. They\nare financially secure. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree while serving in the Army and an\nMBA in December 1996. \n \nApplicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) on board an Army\nbase in March 1973. He was punished under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ), fined $75, and lost his on-base driving privilege. In 1988, Applicant was sent back\nto an Army base in the United States from an overseas assignment for alcohol treatment\nbecause of his own concern about his pattern of alcohol use. (Tr. pp. 62-63) He underwent\noutpatient treatment from November 23, 1988 to April 23, 1989, was diagnosed as alcohol\nabusive, and received a prognosis for successful rehabilitation. After completing the\ntreatment, Applicant remained alcohol abstinent \u201c(F)or quite a period of time.\u201d (Tr. p. 63)\nIn July 1996, Applicant was confronted by his employer because a co-worker\nreported his suspicion that Applicant was consuming alcohol at work. Applicant denies\nbeing intoxicated but does admit to going out to his automobile prior to being confronted\nand consuming alcohol. Applicant was given the ultimatum of obtaining alcohol treatment\nor losing his job. He received seven days of inpatient treatment, followed by four weeks\noutpatient treatment, and was diagnosed by a physician as being alcohol dependent and\nhaving an adjustment disorder. (GE 5) Applicant attended alcoholics anonymous (AA)\nmeetings as part of the outpatient program and for a short while afterwards. (Tr. pp. 66-67)\nHe again \u201cstayed abstinent for quite a while. . . .\u201d (Tr. p. 68)  \nApplicant was charged with DUI in January 2004. He admits he was sitting in an\nairport parking lot drinking alcohol in a rental vehicle before boarding a flight home after a\nwork-related trip. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0.233 when he was arrested.\nHe was found guilty of the DUI and sentenced to 12 months probation, fined $500, and\nordered to perform 50 hours community service and attend a DUI course. He also had his\ndriving privilege restricted and an interlock system installed on his vehicle. Applicant paid\nan additional $500 in lieu of performing the community service. He successfully completed\nall terms of the probationary sentence and it was terminated after only six months.\nApplicant collapsed at work on January 24, 2007, suffering from what he describes\nas alcohol dehydration. He admits to leaving his work place and consuming alcohol at his\ncar before collapsing. He was taken from his work place to a hospital, resided in an\ninpatient detoxification program from January 26-30, 2007, and received outpatient\ntreatment for alcohol dependence from January 31, 2007 to March 1, 2007.\nApplicant testified he has not consumed alcohol since January 26, 2007. He\nexplained the only reason he consumed alcohol at all following the January 24, 2007\nincident was because he had been advised by a nurse at the program not to enter the\ntreatment program \u201ccold turkey\u201d. (Tr. p. 61) He successfully completed the program at a\nstate licensed substance abuse treatment center under the clinical care of a medical doctor\nand licensed mental health counselor. His prognosis from the program is excellent that he\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

He attends AA meeting a couple of times a\nmonth and several months before the hearing acquired an AA sponsor who he periodically\ncontacts. He begins each day by reading religious based AA literature and he has resumed\nregular attendance at religious services. He has little to no contact with people who are\nconsuming alcohol and does not have alcohol in his residence. Applicant is committed to\nremaining alcohol abstinent for the remainder of his life.   \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption)\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant received punishment under Article 15, UCMJ in 1973 for an on-base DUI.\nHe was convicted of DUI in 2004. His 0.234 BAC following the 2004 arrest substantiates\nthat he was grossly intoxicated at the time. He was returned to the U.S. from an overseas\nArmy assignment in 1988 because of his own concern about his drinking and attended an\noutpatient alcohol treatment program. In 1996, he was required to attend an alcohol\nprogram because of concern about his on-the-job alcohol use in order to retain his\nemployment. He passed out at work in 2007 after drinking in his vehicle while working. He\nattended alcohol treatment programs in 1988, 1996, and 2007, and has been diagnosed\nas alcohol dependent. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such\nas driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as\nreporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent; DC 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent; DC 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;\nDC 22(f): relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an\nalcohol treatment rehabilitation program all apply.\nApplicant had undertaken an alcohol abstinent lifestyle for about 13 months as of\nthe date of the hearing, just as he did following successful completion of alcohol programs\nin 1988 and 1996. He is obviously committed to remaining sober and maintaining\nabstinence. He now admits he is an alcoholic, he occasionally attends AA meetings, he\nhas acquired an AA sponsor, he regularly attends religious services, and he daily reads\n\n6\nreligious based AA reading material. Mitigating Condition (MC) 23(b): the individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) applies.\nApplicant also recently obtained a very favorable prognosis from the 2007 program\nhe completed under the clinical care of a physician. Thus, he is entitled to application of\nMC 23(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.   \n   \nThe relatively short period of time that has passed since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-\nrelated incident and treatment, coupled with the history of prior alcohol-related incidents,\ntreatments, and relapses precludes application of MC 23(a): so much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; or MC23(c): the individual is a current employee who\nis participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment\nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress. \nThe whole person concept weighs heavily in Applicant\u2019s favor. His successful\nmilitary and civilian careers, residential and family stability, financial security, and\noutstanding letters of recommendation, employment appraisals, and other certificates of\ncommendation clearly demonstrate he has earned a reputation as a dependable,\nrespected, and trustworthy individual. There is no reason to think he would ever\nintentionally do anything contrary to the interests of the United States.  \nNevertheless, the objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded,\ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to\nclassified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a\nperson by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment,\nmature thinking, and careful analysis. Further, it must once again be noted that any\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nApplicant has a lengthy history of repeated alcohol-related incidents, successful\ncompletion of alcohol treatment programs and relapses. Two of the alcohol-related\nincidents occurred in the work place while Applicant possessed a top secret security\nclearance and either had or could have had access to classified information. He is\naggressively pursuing a lifestyle of sobriety and alcohol abstinence and doing almost\neverything that could be asked of him to maintain that lifestyle. \n\n7\nStill, it has only been a little over a year since the last incident and during which he\nhas remained sober and abstinent. Considering the two prior treatments which were each\nfollowed by abstinent periods of \u201cquite a while\u201d in the words of Applicant, it is simply too\nsoon to be able to safely predict that another relapse will not occur. The risk of even the\ninadvertent compromise of classified material in the event of another relapse and as\nevidenced by Applicant\u2019s two previous work place incidents is too great to permit a finding\nthat Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns that exist.         \nAccordingly, and considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances\npresent in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6\nof the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his alcohol consumption. He has\nfailed to overcome the case against him in this regard or satisfy his ultimate burden of\npersuasion. Guideline G is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cohen, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on June 10, 2004.\nOn November 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign influence\n(Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on January 9, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 5, 2008, and the hearing was held on April 2, 2008. Based\non a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility of security\nclearance access is granted. \nMay 29, 2008\n\n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted three exhibits (GE). The third exhibit\n(GE 4, administrative notice exhibit) contains facts from United States Government\nagency publications that describe the government of Iran, its human rights record, and\nthe various difficulties U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country. At the hearing,\ntestimony was taken from Applicant and four witnesses. He also submitted fifteen\nexhibits (AE A - AE O). DOHA received the transcript on April 10, 2008.\nRulings on Procedure\nI am taking administrative notice of facts recited in Department Counsel\u2019s\nmemorandum. These facts have been culled from U.S. State Departments listed at the\nend of the government\u2019s Administrative Notice Memorandum. The underlying\ndocuments will be attached to the record, but are not admitted as government exhibits. \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant moved to amend SOR 1.c. (Tr. 4) by\nadding a sentence to the existing allegation. The amendment reads as follows, \u201cOne\nhalf-brother (21 years old) has been approved to immigrate to the U.S. in 2001, but is\nawaiting his visa from the U.S. State Department.\u201d The government did not object to the\nproposed amendment. Pursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive, the amendment was\ngranted. (Tr. 4, 5)\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that Applicant\u2019s ties and travel to Iran raise\nforeign influence concerns. He admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. He\ndenied subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.e. due to changed circumstances. The underlying\nreason for the denial to subparagraph 1.b. is that his father has been a United States\n(U.S.) citizen since 1984. (AE F) His mother is a citizen of Iran living with Applicant in\nthis country, and plans to become a U.S. citizen when she is eligible in May 2008. She\nhas a U.S. permanent resident card. (AE G) Even though Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a\ncitizen of Iran (SOR 1.e.), he is now living with Applicant in the U.S., and expects to\napply for U.S. citizenship in October 2009. He has his U.S. permanent resident card.\n(AE I) \nApplicant is 38 years old and married. He is employed as a computer\nprogrammer for a defense contractor located at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).\nHe has held his position since his hire in June 2004. He seeks a secret security\nclearance.\nIn December 1969, Applicant was born in Iran, and is a member of the Baha\u2019i\nreligious faith. See, AE L. As I shall discuss later, during his childhood, he spent a\nconsiderable amount of time at a neighbor\u2019s home, where he developed a close\nfriendship with witness B (Applicant\u2019s best friend) and witness A (Applicant\u2019s future\nwife). \n\n AE D is verification of Applicant\u2019s arrest in 1985. \n1\n The Iranian court advised the ministry of education of Applicant\u2019s arrest. As a result, Applicant could not\n2\nenroll in the school he had been attending, and had to enroll in another school to complete his last two years\nof high school. \n3\nApplicant\u2019s parents, resident citizens of Iran, separated in about 1974 when\nApplicant was five or six. His father immigrated to the U.S. in 1978, and became a U.S.\ncitizen in 1984. (AE I) Applicant\u2019s father is 88 years old, and has lived in the central part\nof the U.S. since 1979. (answer to SOR) Applicant\u2019s mother remarried and bore a son in\n(circa) 1980 and another son in approximately 1987. After their stepfather passed away\nin 1988, Applicant\u2019s two half-brothers viewed him as a fatherly figure and big brother. \nBefore his successful exit from Iran in 1991, Applicant tried unsuccessfully to\nleave the country three times in the 1980s. In 1983, he was 13 years old when he was\nsupposed to travel to a location to be smuggled out of Iran. At a checkpoint along the\nway to meet the smuggler, someone discovered Applicant did not speak the local\ndialect. He was removed from a bus, and spent a week in detention where he was\ninterrogated and beaten by security officials in their effort to obtain details of the\nsmuggling operation. (Tr. 153-155) He revealed nothing. \nApplicant tried to leave Iran a second time in 1985. This time he managed to get\na little bit closer to the Iranian border (with Turkey), but had to turn back due to adverse\nweather conditions. He was 15 years old when security officials came to his house and\narrested him.  \n1\nIn December 1987, Applicant tried a third time to escape. (Tr. 156) With the help\nof his mother, who knew he was determined to get out of the country, he found a\nsmuggler (with a successful smuggling background) who agreed to take him and five\nothers to Turkey. On their way, Iranian security stopped and arrested them. AE E\nreflects that Applicant was arrested on December 22, 1987 and released to his parents\u2019\ncustody in April 1988.  During his detention, he was beaten regularly but disclosed\n2\nnothing. \nIn 1991, Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and\nmathematics. (Tr. 148; GE 1) During Thanksgiving 1991, he was finally permitted to\nleave Iran. Although he had been eligible for a green card (permanent resident card)\nsince he was 13 years old, he could not get a passport to leave Iran until he was about\n22 years old. He was required to return to Iran for five successive years to satisfy a\nmilitary exemption law applicable to the eldest son in a family with no father/husband.\nUnder Iranian law in 1991/1992, in a family with no father/husband, the eldest son was\nexempt from serving in the military so he could take care of his mother. This exemption\nwas temporary and had to be renewed yearly for five years, so one\u2019s passport was valid\nfor only one year. At the end of the five-year period, the exemption became permanent\n\n Applicant indicated in GE 3 that his exemption ended in 1995. \n3\n GE 1 reveals she was living in a southwestern city of the U.S. in June 2004.\n4\n Applicant also has two half-brothers from his father\u2019s first marriage. They were born in Iran and are\n5\nnaturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 216)\n4\nalong with the passport. (Tr. 169)  Applicant surrendered his Iranian passport in October\n3\n2006.\nApplicant received additional computer training in the U.S. between 1992 and\n1994. (AE A) He was granted his U.S. citizenship in October 1997. (GE 1) He has\nworked as a software developer for six employers around the U.S. A major reason\nApplicant moved to the upper northwest location in the U.S. in 1999 was his desire to\nfind more permanent employment with benefits that his previous contractor positions did\nnot offer him. (Tr. 174) In June 2004, Applicant was hired by NRL. \nIn response to his oldest half-brother\u2019s request, Applicant returned to Iran to\nattend his half-brother\u2019s wedding. (Tr. 170) Applicant does not consider himself close to\neither half-brother. They speak to each other maybe three times a year on birthdays and\nholidays. (Tr. 171-174) The last e-mail Applicant received from his half-brothers was in\n2006. (Tr. 218)\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Iran, but has lived with Applicant since June\n2007. She has been a resident of the U.S since 2003; she has her U.S. resident card.\n(AE G) She intends to obtain her U.S. citizenship, although learning English has been a\nchallenge for her. Previously, she was living with Applicant one out of every six months.4\nAfter each stay, she returned to Iran to take care of Applicant\u2019s youngest half-brother.\nWhen the half-brother reached 21, she moved in with Applicant permanently in June\n2007. Applicant\u2019s mother calls her two sons (Applicant\u2019s half-brothers) approximately\nonce a month, and they call her once every other month. (Tr. 205)  She has no plans to\n5\nreturn to Iran. (Tr. 203) Although Applicant sponsored his youngest half-brother for\nimmigration (AE K), he is aware it takes up to 10 years before siblings are granted\nauthorization to immigrate. \nOn October 10, 2006, Applicant shredded his Iranian passport; this act was\nwitnessed by his employer\u2019s supervisor, the government supervisor, and the facility\nsecurity officer. (AE B) On the same day, Applicant signed a statement stating that, \u201c. . .\nI would like to relinquish my Iranian citizenship in favor of a sole United States\ncitizenship.\u201d (AE C) A requirement for working at NRL by employees from foreign\ncountries is to relinquish their foreign passports. (Tr. 185) At some time before he\nshredded his passport in October 2006 (date not revealed in the record), Applicant went\nto the Iranian Interest Section (of the Pakistani Embassy) to turn in his passport. The\nIranian officials punched a hole in the passport and returned it to him. He opined the\npassport was punched to alert Iranian immigration officials that the passport was\n\n For several years following their father\u2019s death, they assumed his death resulted from natural causes.\n6\nHowever, as the years passed, they became less certain and more concerned because of the different\nreasons the Iranian government supplied for his death. (Tr. 85-88)\n5\ndefective, and lead to possible detention of the passport holder at the Iranian border.\n(Tr. 187-189)\nApplicant hates the Iranian government because of their mistreatment of their\npeople, their involvement in terrorist activities, and the authoritarian form of government.\n(Tr. 193) If Applicant ever became the target of pressure, he stated:\nI would notify the security officer first. But anybody who knows me knows\nthat if you try to apply pressure on me for doing that I believe it\u2019s not right,\nyou will get the exact opposite. It will make me more determined not to\nhelp them, th[a]n if they didn\u2019t put pressure. So if they arrested my half-\nbrothers and send me threat that they will kill them, there is nothing I can\ndo about it. I will be sad, but that will not persuade me to do anything that I\nbelieve is wrong. (Tr. 194)\nApplicant would eagerly bear arms against Iran. (Tr. 195) \nNone of Applicant\u2019s relatives have ever been employees of or agents of the\nIranian government. Witness A\u2019s father was in the Iranian Air Force for more than 20\nyears, but died in 1988.\nWitness A, Applicant\u2019s Muslim wife, is 33 years old. She was born in Iran. She\nlives with Applicant. She has a bachelor of science degree in material engineering, and\nhas several credits toward a fine arts degree. She currently is an assistant manager at a\nclothing store in the area. She has known Applicant for approximately 25 years, having\nmet him when she was about eight years old, and he was 13 at the time. Her brother\n(witness B) was Applicant\u2019s classmate in school. Even though witness A was conscious\nthat Applicant\u2019s religion was different from her religion, the two families had a good\nrelationship. \nWhen witness A was 23 years old (1997), she, her mother and witness B (her\nbrother) were smuggled out of Iran. Their departure became imminent after A\u2019s brother\nand their mother received threats of harm for asking questions about their father\u2019s\ndemise.  Witness A\u2019s mother was detained for 3 days as a result of her informal\n6\ninvestigation into her husband\u2019s death.\nAbout 10 days after witness B was threatened (Tr. 88), he, witness A, and their\nmother sold what they could, then exited Iran. They left their house and some property\nbehind. After entering Turkey, they flew to Thailand for about three weeks before\nlanding in Canada during Thanksgiving 1997. On their arrival, they contacted the\nimmigration office who declared their refugee status. The immigration office released\n\n6\nthem to witness A\u2019s aunt. There is no additional evidence regarding the aunt of witness\nA.\nWitness A, witness B, and their mother, received their permanent resident status\ncards in Canada. Witness A found work in the retail business, and also enrolled in some\nfine arts classes. Witness A\u2019s mother, who is still a permanent resident of Canada (Tab\nJ), landed employment as an administrative secretary in a computer office. (Tr. 96) \nWhen witness A, witness B, and their mother arrived in Canada at her aunt\u2019s\nhouse in 1997, Applicant coincidentally happened to be there because it was\nThanksgiving. Over the next few years, Applicant visited witness A and her family more\nfrequently, especially after he moved to an upper northwest location in the U.S. in 1999.\nApplicant and witness A began dating and were married in Canada in August 2001. \nAbout five years passed before witness A moved to the U.S. because of the\ncircumstances of September 11, 2001. She relented after much persuasion on his part\nto persuade her to come to U.S. She changed her mind after he was accepted for the\njob in the local area in June 2004.\nWitness A received her U.S. green card in 2006 (Tab H), and plans to apply for\nher U.S. citizenship in about six months. She has lived with Applicant since\napproximately October 2006. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s mother came to live with Applicant in\nJune 2007, and Witness B came to live with Applicant in October 2007. Witness A has\nno desire to return to Iran. She has no family members left in the country. (Tr. 108)\nWitness A enjoys the U.S. She testified:\nI love every moment of it. I - - first of all, I live with my husband finally,\nwhich is like incredible. And the reactions that people have to the fact that\nI was born in Iran and there is nobody - - everybody think that, you know,\npeople are going to react to you like really differently. They are going to\ntreat you as enemy, but I found it - - I found that people are very well-\neducated.\nThey know that if some crazy person in some distant land trying to do\nharm to other people, it has nothing to do with me. I love this country. I\ncame here to change my life. I came here to have a better life. They don\u2019t\njudge me by that perception. They judge me by who I am, which is\namazing, which is amazing. (Tr. 104-105)\nWitness A believes Applicant is very honest. She also considers him to be\nendowed with strong convictions. She testified:\nIf he believes in something that is right, nothing can change his mind.\nNothing. I mean, he had been arrested for to flee Iran a few times. And\nevery time they tried to get information from him to, you know make him\nsay who was smuggling - - you know, what was the plan and everything.\n\n W itness B has not returned to Iran since his escape from the country in 1997. (Tr. 138)\n7\n Applicant\u2019s counsel proffered that witness B would testify to the same facts as witness A.. Department\n8\nCounsel had no objection to abbreviating witness B\u2019s testimony. (Tr. 124)\n Just as his sister had done, witness B had to obtain his permanent alien status in Canada before qualifying\n9\nto receive his U.S. green card.\n The favorable character statement was signed by eight people in Applicant\u2019s chain of command, including\n10\nthe superintendent of the Technology Division at NRL. \n7\nHe never said a word about any of that, because he didn\u2019t believe that\u2019s\nthe right thing to do. And I personally really admire that. (Tr. 106,107)\nWitness B, 38 years old, was born in Iran, and is still a citizen of the country. He\nhas been Applicant\u2019s best friend since childhood. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s\nunsuccessful attempts to leave Iran in the 1980s. In a conversation Applicant had with\nwitness B, an aunt Applicant no longer has any contact with, alerted Iranian security\nofficials of Applicant\u2019s plans to escape in December 1987. Applicant has not seen or\ntalked with that aunt since his arrest in 1987, according to witness B. (Tr. 137-139)\nAs witness A indicated earlier in her testimony, she, witness B, and their mother\nwere successfully smuggled out of Iran in 1997,  leaving their possessions behind.\n7\n8\nApplicant\u2019s wife (witness A), witness B, and their mother lived in Canada from 1997 to\n2007, with witness B employed as a computer store manager, and a budding\nphotographer in his spare time. Witness B and his wife, who he married in 2004, came\nto live with Applicant in October 2007. No additional information was presented\nregarding witness B\u2019s wife. Their mother continues to live in Canada. Witness B has\nbeen a permanent U.S. resident since October 2007 (AE I),  and intends to become a\n9\nU.S. citizen. Witness B testified that he did not know of any contact Applicant may have\nhad with any family members or friends in Iran. (Tr. 141-143) \nCharacter Evidence\nThe library director at the NRL testified he supervises the contract that Applicant\nworks on. Through daily interaction, the director has found Applicant a reliable and\ntrustworthy person. (AE M)  Other positive attributes the director has found in\n10\nApplicant\u2019s performance are his habit for dependably gauging how long it will take to get\na project completed, and then completing the job in a timely fashion. (Tr. 48) When\nApplicant began working at the NRL site, he spoke to the director about his\nunsuccessful escapes from Iran, and his overall dislike for the Iranian government. (Tr.\n49) The director was present when Applicant shredded his Iranian passport in October\n2006. (AE B)\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor has worked with Applicant since 2004. He\nbelieves Applicant is a diligent and trustworthy employee. Applicant told the supervisor\nabout the terrible conditions in Iran, and his imprisonment for trying to leave the country.\n\n Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006 Iran, U.S. Department of State, bureau of Democracy,\n11\nHuman Rights and Labor, dated March 6, 2007.\n Travel Warning: Iran, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, dated January 3, 2008.\n12\n Background Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, dated June 2007.\n13\n Country Reports on Terrorism2006, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism overview, U.S. Department\n14\nof State, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 30, 2007; Making America Safer by\nDefeating Extremists in the Middle east, State by President of the United States, released by the Office of the\nW hite House Press Secretary, August 28, 2007; Annual threat Assessment for the Senate Select Committee\non Intelligence, Director of National Intelligence, February 5, 2008.\n8\n(Tr. 70) The supervisor witnessed Applicant shred his Iranian passport in October 2006.\n(AE B) Though he could not remember whether he saw Applicant sign AE C\n(renunciation of citizenship), the supervisor recalled Applicant\u2019s explanation that, since\nIran does not allow renunciation of citizenship, Applicant wanted to do what he could to\nshow he did not want to be a citizen of Iran. (Tr. 73)\nAdministrative Notice\nSince the Muslim clergy came to power in the early 1980s, the Islamic Republic\nof Iran has fostered a poor human rights record through repression of its people  as\n11\nwell as through mistreatment of U.S.-Iranian dual citizens.  The Iranian government\n12\nhas pursued weapons of mass destruction  and supported terrorist activities throughout\n13\nthe Middle East.  Applicant credibly testified that he knows and abhors Iran\u2019s ugly\n14\nhuman rights practices inside the country, and the country\u2019s promotion of terrorism\nabroad.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n9\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\nforcing an applicant into a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \nAnalysis\n\u201cForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns where those contacts\nand interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or induced by a foreign\nentity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\nentity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign country where the\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to whether the foreign\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated\nwith the risk of terrorism.\u201d \nThe government has established a preliminary basis for denying Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application. His spouse, his mother, his half brothers, his mother-in-\nlaw, and his brother-in-law are citizens of Iran. His family\u2019s Iranian citizenship, when\nconsidered in light of Iranian\u2019s authoritarian government, characterized by poor human\nrights and terrorist practices, could result in the compromise of classified information\nbecause it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion and pressure. Foreign\nInfluence (FI) disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member,\n\n W hile the Appeal Board has held that the security concerns arising from the presence of Applicant\u2019s family\n15\nmembers in Iran is not mitigated by possibility of a swift and safe departure from Iran, I still recognize that\nApplicant is doing what he can to comply with the immigration laws so that his brother can eventually emigrate\nto the U.S. See, ISCR Case No. 01-20908 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2003) \n10\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies. Applicant\u2019s two\nhalf-brothers are still resident citizens of Iran. However, while still a citizen of Iran,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has had her U.S. permanent resident card since October 2006, and\nanticipates becoming a U.S. citizen in about six months. She has been living with\nApplicant since October 2006. She has no relatives she maintains contacts within Iran,\nand has no intention of returning to the country.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is still a citizen of Iran, but has permanently lived with\nApplicant since June 2007. She too has her U.S. permanent resident card and\nanticipates citizenship in the near future. Applicant\u2019s father has been living in the central\npart of the U.S. since 1979, and has been a U.S. citizen since 1984. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Iran, but has been a permanent resident\nof Canada since the late 1990s. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law has been a resident citizen\nsince October 2007. He has no plans to return to Iran, and intends to become a U.S.\ncitizen. \nFI DC 7.b. (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information) applies. The fact that Applicants family\nmembers, except for his father, are still citizens of Iran constitutes a potential for conflict\nthat shifts the burden to Applicant to show why he will resolve the conflict in favor of the\nU.S. As noted in the preceding paragraph, the geographical location and official\nresidency status of his family members, except for his two half-brothers, has changed.\nIn addition, his mother, his spouse, and his brother-in-law have their green cards, and\nintend to apply for U.S. citizenship. \nFI DC 7.d. (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) also applies based on fact that Applicant\u2019s spouse\nhas a U.S. permanent resident card she received in October 2006, and has been living\nwith Applicant for over a year. Applicant\u2019s mother has her U.S. permanent resident card\nshe received in September 2003, and has lived with Applicant twice a year until she\nmoved in permanently in July 2007. While Applicant\u2019s half-brothers still reside in and are\ncitizens of Iran, Applicant has sponsored the younger half-brother for eventual\nimmigration to the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is still a citizen of Iran, but she is a\n15\npermanent resident of Canada, and has lived there since the late 1990s. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother-in-law received his U.S. permanent residency card in October 2007, and has\n\n11\nlived with Applicant since that date. Though Applicant\u2019s family members remain targets\nand conduits for influence due to their Iranian citizenship, I do not find that, considering\nthe evidence as a whole, they pose the same heightened risk of influence under FI DC\n7.d. as they did before the changes of residence. \nSince Applicant\u2019s family members are citizens of Iran, whose government has a\nhostile relationship with the government of the U.S. Applicant bears a heavy burden of\nshowing his family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26983\n(October 16, 2002) \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nEven though Applicant\u2019s spouse, mother, mother-in-law, and brother-in law are\nstill citizens of Iran, they are either official residents of Canada or the U.S., and have\nrights and legal protections consistent with their resident status in both countries. They\ndo not intend to return to Iran, but they do intend to become U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s\nwife (witness A) is an assistant manager in retail in the U.S. She had the same\nemployment while in Canada for about ten years. Witness A\u2019s mother, who was\ndetained for three days in Iran in the 1990s, has been a secretary in Canada for a long\ntime. The record is silent on the avocation of Applicant\u2019s mother. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw was a store manager and photographer in Canada, and is pursuing photography in\nthe U.S. None of the listed family members were employees or agents of the Iranian\ngovernment. Leaving Iran in 1997 because of the threats and detention, and having\nachieved permanent residency status first in Canada and eventually in the U.S., it is my\ncommonsense view that the chances of pressure being exerted on and through his\nimmediate family members to Applicant in the future is extremely low. The mitigating\nevidence presented under FI MC 8.a. resolves SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n\n ISCR Case No. 02-26826 (November 12, 2003). \n16\n12\nThe chances of Applicant succumbing to foreign exploitation/pressure are\nreduced even more by his convincing testimony of his strong feelings against the\nIranian government, and the steps he would take to resist and report attempts to\ninfluence him. Though a person\u2019s intentions about a future event may not be entitled to\nmuch weight,  Applicant\u2019s teenage history of detention, intimidation, and torture at the\n16\nhands of Iranian security officials in the 1980s for trying to escape the country\npersuades me to conclude he will fulfill out his stated intention regarding the protection\nof classified information. Applicant\u2019s past conduct in not disclosing information to the\nIranian authorities (about details of the smuggling operation and/or involvement of his\nmother) justifies complete confidence he will employ the same resistance efforts to\nsuccessfully repel any coercive or non-coercive effort at foreign influence in the future.\nHaving weighed the entire record, I believe Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the U.S. and\nhis job at NRL outweighs his relationships with his half-brothers, resident citizens of\nIran. The character witness testimony, and the fact-based testimony of witness A and B\nindicate he will resolve any conflict in favor of the interests of the U.S., and consistent\nwith FI MC 8.b. SOR 1.c. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFI MC 8.c. is inapplicable to this case. Even though Applicant\u2019s contacts with his\nhalf brothers are less than four times a year, those contacts added to his mother\u2019s\ncontacts (although she has no plans to return to Iran) cannot be considered casual and\ninfrequent. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant was 22 years old when he arrived\nin the U.S. in 1997, and under a permanent resident status in this country. He had two\ndegrees from an Iranian university, and he pursued additional computer training just\nafter he emigrated to the U.S. He has held several computer jobs in the U.S. before\nlanding the NRL position in June 2004. He received his U.S. citizenship in 1997. \nApplicant obtained an Iranian passport in 2002, but his only trip back to Iran was\nin 2002 when he attended his half-brother\u2019s wedding. Even though he knew he could\nnot relinquish his citizenship in 2006, he tried to turn in his passport at the Iranian\nInterest Section of Pakistani Embassy. Just before he had his Iranian passport\n\n13\nshredded in October 2006, he signed a statement (which was witnessed)\ncommunicating his intention to relinquish his Iranian citizenship.\nIt is my predictive decision that given (1) Applicant\u2019s personal experiences with\ndetention, intimidation and beatings as a teenager, (2) his disapproval of the dreadful\npractices of the Iranian government inside and outside the country, and (3) his\ncomprehension of the government\u2019s increased security concerns to foil any potential\navenues for foreign influence, I am confidant Applicant will successfully resist and report\nforeign influence in the future. The praiseworthy character testimony strengthens my\nconfidence that Applicant will stand by his stated intentions. Considering the evidence in\nthe context of the whole person model, Applicant has met his heavy burden of mitigating\nthe security concerns arising from the residency and citizenship of his family members.\nHis trip to Iran in 2002 was prompted by a desire to see his older half-brother\u2019s wedding.\nApplicant\u2019s trip for his family member\u2019s wedding in Iran has no independent security\nsignificance under the FI guideline. See, ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sept. 21,\n2005) SOR 1.f. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn September 29, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(e-QIP). On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nH for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 28, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 20, \n2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five \nMarch 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on December 26, 2007. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on January 2, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file \nobjections and submit additional information. Applicant did not submit additional \nevidence. On March 13, 2008, the case was assigned to me. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \n   \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and married. In April 2003, he earned a Doctorate of \nPhilosophy in Industrial Psychology. In May 2006, he began working as a research \nscientist for his current employer, a federal contractor. In September 2006, he submitted \nan e-QIP.  (Item 4). \n \n \nIn response to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity on the e-\nQIP, Applicant disclosed the following information: (1) during August 2006, he used \nmarijuana on one occasion; (2) from September 2002 to February 2006, he used \nmarijuana 40-50 times; (3) in September 2003, he used cocaine once; (4) from January \n1999 to September 2002, he used marijuana 80-100 times; and (5) from February 2000 \nto February 2002, he used cocaine three times. (Item 4 at 39). \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant completed Interrogatories regarding the above \ninformation. Applicant again disclosed the frequency and amount of his drug usage, and \nnoted that he also used marijuana from August 1993 to December 1998 about 80 to 100 \ntimes. He asserted, \u201cI stopped smoking marijuana in 2/2006. I did smoke once again in \n8/2006 but have not since then.\u201d (Item 5 at 60). He decided to quit using illegal drugs \nbecause \u201cit was time to \u201cgrow up\u201d and know that if I wanted to receive a clearance one \nday that I would have to stop.\u201d (Id.).  During a December 2006 interview with a \ngovernment investigator, Applicant indicated that he never purchased marijuana or \ncocaine, but obtained it at social settings. (Id. at 26).  His wife, parents and close friends \nknow he used marijuana, but not the extent. They do not know about his cocaine use.  \nBecause he never felt addicted to marijuana, he has not sought treatment to cease \nusing it.  (Id.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhallucinogens), and; (2) inhalants and other similar substances; (b) drug \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a)-(h) describe eight Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions that \nmay be applicable to security concerns raised under this guideline. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s admissions that he used cocaine and marijuana from approximately August \n1993 until September 2006, the Government raised a potentially disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition).\u201d \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nFour Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (a)-(d) are potentially \napplicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n I reviewed the record evidence as a whole and conclude none apply. AG \u00b6 26(a) \ndoes not apply because Applicant has frequently used marijuana and occasionally \ncocaine for the past fourteen years.  His drug abuse does cast doubt on his current \nreliability and raises questions about his trustworthiness and good judgment.  Other \nthan his assertion in September 2007 that he has abstained from using illegal drugs \nsince August 2006 and does not intend to use drugs in the future, Applicant did not \nproduce any independent substantive evidence to corroborate his claim. Given the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfrequency of his use since 1993, his statement alone is not persuasive and does not \ndemonstrate an intention to stop abusing drugs, sufficient to trigger the application of   \nAG \u00b6 26(b).  His drug use has not involved the abuse of prescription drugs, as required \nunder AG \u00b6 26(c), nor has he completed a drug treatment program, which is necessary \nto establish AG \u00b6 26(d). \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Those factors include: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 32-year-old highly \neducated man, who began voluntarily using illegal drugs in 1993 and continued using \nthem until August 2006, three months after beginning his current employment with a \nfederal contractor. While his September 2007 statement that he does not intend to use \nmarijuana or cocaine in the future, along with his honest disclosure of his drug history, \nrepresent positive steps in addressing his drug problem, they are woefully inadequate to \nmitigate years of illegal drug use. Although he claims he is not addicted to marijuana, \nthe evidence tends to paint a different picture. Absent independent corroboration, such \nas an evaluation from an appropriately credentialed health care provider or other \nsource, documenting Applicant\u2019s assertions that he is drug free, along with proof of \nhonest disclosures to his family about his drug use, he did not demonstrate that it is \nunlikely that he will cease using illegal drugs in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
