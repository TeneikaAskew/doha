On her first security clearance \napplication, in 2020, she disclosed the marijuana use but not the other illegal drug use. \nMost of her drug use occurred several years ago but it did not end conclusively until \nMarch 2022, when she was working in a sensitive position with a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). I conclude that Applicant \nprovided sufficient evidence in mitigation, including her subsequent maturity, credible \nexpressions of remorse, evidence of rehabilitation, and substantial whole person \ncharacter evidence, to mitigate Guideline H and Guideline E security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCAs) on June 23, 2020, \nand April 5, 2022. On November 18, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DSCA CAS) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and Guideline E (personal conduct).

She addressed the allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). She included exhibits \nA through V. The case was assigned to me on October 31, 2023. On November 15, \n2023, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for January 10, 2024, by \nvideo-teleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant offered the attachments to her SOR Response as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through V.1 (Applicant\u2019s resum\u00e9 was inadvertently omitted \nbut was submitted after the hearing and included as part of AE J). (Tr. 18-19) All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant and four witnesses testified. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 23, 2024. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a to conform \nto the record evidence by adding a comma and the phrase \u201c. . . and holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d at the end of the allegation. The motion was granted without objection and \nSOR \u00b6 1.a was amended accordingly.

She used \nmarijuana again in high school, beginning in about May 2012, usually in social settings. \nShe graduated from high school in 2013, and started college that fall, though she \nwithdrew in the spring 2014 term. She moved in with a childhood friend and started \nworking in bars and restaurants. Between May 2014 and August 2014, she used \nmarijuana about weekly. She also purchased it from friends. In summer 2014, she \nmoved in with her boyfriend, now her husband. She also decided to focus on her \nstudies. Between 2014 and 2017, she used marijuana about 10 to 20 times. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) She generally smoked it or used a vape pen, either in social situations or to help \nher sleep. Between 2017 and 2022, she did not use marijuana. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. 23-39, \n70-79) \nApplicant reported on her June 2020 SCA that she used marijuana between May \n2013 and May 2014 about three to five times a month. (Her brief middle school use was \nbeyond the seven-year scope of the question). She reported using marijuana \u201conly a \nfew times\u201d between 2014 and 2017, that she did not use marijuana after beginning her \ncollege studies, and no longer used marijuana. She also acknowledged that marijuana \nwas \u201cbanned on a federal level.\u201d She disavowed any future use of marijuana because of \nher chosen career, knowing drug use was not tolerated, and \u201ccould cost me my career,\u201d \nas well as due to the chemical effects marijuana has on her thought process. (GE 2 at \n50; Tr. 73-75) \nApplicant had also experimented with cocaine, between June 2014 and October \n2018. Within that timeframe, she used cocaine two or three times in social situations. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) She no longer socializes with the people with whom she used cocaine. She \nhas no interest in using cocaine again. It would risk her job and her marriage. She has \nnot been around any cocaine use since 2018. (Affidavit, AE D; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 47-55, 95-\n96)  \nBetween about March 2018 and January 2021, Applicant used prescription diet \nmedication (diet pills) that were not prescribed to her. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) She first used the \nprescription diet pills in 2018, when she was in college and working at a restaurant. The \npills, which were amphetamines, were widely available from co-workers, who would get \nthem from a local dealer known as a \u201cdiet doctor.\u201d She got the pills from a co-worker, C, \nand she knew they were not prescribed to her. She took the pills because she wanted to \nlose weight. She used the pills over three different timeframes, or \u201ccycles,\u201d of about a \nweek, the last time in 2021. She knew what she was doing was illegal under state and \nfederal law and was against her employer\u2019s drug policy. She stopped because she did \nnot like the side effects. She no longer socializes or interacts with C.

She did not \ndisclose her prior cocaine use, and she also did not disclose her use of someone\u2019s \nelse\u2019s prescription drug medication, both of which had occurred during the previous \nseven years. These two omissions are alleged in the SOR as deliberate falsifications \nunder Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c), as they should have been disclosed in response to \nrelevant \u201cseven-year timeframe\u201d questions on her June 2020 SCA (GE 2 at 50-51) \nApplicant acknowledged that she did not disclose the full extent of her drug use \nbecause she was scared that she would not get a job if she were totally honest about \nher drug use. She was just completing her college studies. She is regretful and \nremorseful and now understands that the security clearance system is based on \nhonesty from clearance holders. (AE D; Tr. 40-41; 63-66) She also said no one spoke to \nher during the clearance application process about guiding her through the SCA \nquestions. (Tr. 79, 93-94) She said she did not disclose her cocaine use on her 2020 \nSCA because she regarded it as \u201con a different level\u201d (i.e., more serious) than \nmarijuana use, which she did disclose. She acknowledged that cocaine use was \u201ca hard \none to admit,\u201d (Tr. 96) She also knew that she should have answered \u201cYes\u201d and \nreported the diet pill misuse on her 2020 SCA. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant was granted eligibility for a secret clearance by DOD on or about \nAugust 5, 2020. (GE 4; Tr. 22) She acknowledged that while working for the Air Force, \nshe had actual access to classified information, and worked in a classified environment, \nfrom the granting of her clearance eligibility until she left the job in January 2022. (Tr. \n100-102) During this time, she engaged in her last cycle of prescription diet pills. \nOn one occasion in March 2022, Applicant used marijuana at a friend\u2019s wedding. \nApplicant explained that she became extremely nauseous at the wedding, and she used \na friend\u2019s \u201cvape pen\u201d to inhale THC to try to alleviate her nausea. (GE 3 at 5; Affidavit, \nAE D: Tr. 39) She held a clearance at the time, through her job at defense contractor 2, \nbut she did not work in a classified environment. (Tr. 102-103) While it was not clear \nthat she had been \u201cgranted access to classified information\u201d at the time, she held a \nclearance and was \u201cholding a sensitive position.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a was therefore amended \naccordingly, as noted above.) \nApplicant acknowledged knowing that using marijuana was illegal under federal \nlaw and that it was against security clearance protocol. She said when she used \nmarijuana at the wedding in March 2022, she knew she would have to report it on her \nnext SCA. She believed that her next SCA was the next opportunity to disclose it. She \ndid not report her drug use to her facility security officer at the time and did not know \nshe would soon be submitting an updated SCA.

She also disclosed misusing a \nprescription diet medication between about March 2018 and January 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nShe reported that she had been granted a secret clearance with the Air Force in about \nSeptember 2020. (GE 1 at 52-54, 56) \nApplicant discussed the details of her drug use in a May 2022 background \ninterview. In a November 2022 interrogatory response, she authenticated the interview \nsummary as accurate, with some corrections about her employment history. She also \nindicated that she had had no further illegal drug use since her interview, that she no \nlonger associated with people who use illegal drugs, and that she had not been around \nillegal drugs. (GE 3; Tr. 32-33) \nWhen asked during her testimony what had changed between her first SCA and \nher second SCA, Applicant said she knew she had been wrong by not being honest the \nfirst time and wanted to \u201cmake that right.\u201d She also made a career change (to defense \ncontractor 2) and wanted to make it her career long term. So, \u201cI knew I had to make it \nright.\u201d She believed that her next SCA was the first opportunity to be fully candid. As \nDepartment Counsel confirmed, she was not interviewed after her June 2020 SCA, \nbecause it was during the COVID pandemic. (Tr. 82-85) \nApplicant acknowledged making a bad decision in being dishonest about the full \nextent of her drug use on her June 2020 SCA. She accepts full responsibility. She said \nshe was embarrassed about her drug use. She decided to correct her prior omissions \non her 2022 SCA. (Applicant\u2019s statement, AE U; Tr. 22) \nIn December 2022, as part of her SOR Response, Applicant was assessed for \nsubstance abuse. She reported her prior drug use fully and honestly in the assessment. \nShe was not recommended for services or drug treatment. She has never been in drug \ncounseling and has never felt the need for it. She has never been arrested for a drug-\nrelated offense. (AE E; Tr. 98, 103-104) She also took a (non-random) drug test and \ntested negative for any illegal drug, (AE G) The same month, she pledged to abstain \nfrom all drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal substances, and \nacknowledged that future drug involvement was grounds for revocation of her clearance \nand national security eligibility. (AE F) In her testimony, she affirmed that she has no \nfuture intentions to use illegal drugs or to use someone else\u2019s prescription. (Tr. 103) \nApplicant testified that her father was addicted to pain medication when she was \ngrowing up. He was also in and out of jail. She also knew friends\u2019 parents who used \ndrugs.

She wanted to stress that she could have \nturned it down, and therefore would not have had to fill out a new SCA and thus, to \nreport all of her drug use, but she chose to do so knowing that she wanted to disclose \neverything.

(AE H) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 details the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana in high school and college, and while working at bars \nand restaurants, between 2012 and 2014, and then less frequently, until 2017. After \nthat, she did not use marijuana again until one time in March 2022 at a friend\u2019s wedding \nto combat nausea. That last instance was after she had submitted GE 2, in June 2020, \nafter she had worked with a clearance in a classified environment in a civilian job with \nthe Air Force and while she had been granted eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and was in a sensitive position with defense contractor 2. \nApplicant also used cocaine on two occasions, in 2014 and 2018, in college. \nBetween 2018 and March 2021, she engaged in the illegal use of a controlled \nsubstance by misusing prescription diet pills during three \u201ccycles\u201d of use during that \ntimeframe, in that she knew she as using prescription diet pills that were not prescribed \nto her. The last cycle of use, in January 2021, occurred while she had was in a sensitive \nposition with the Air Force and had been granted access to classified information. AG \u00b6 \n25(a) applies to the marijuana use, the cocaine use, and the illegal misuse of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprescription diet pills. AG \u00b6 25(c) applies to the January 2021 prescription diet pill \nmisuse and the March 2022 marijuana use at the wedding. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple uses of marijuana and her two-time use of cocaine mostly \ncame between 2014 and 2017 or 2018, when she was younger and less mature, was in \ncollege or working in bars and restaurants and had yet to start her engineering career \nas a cleared professional. She used three cycles of someone else\u2019s prescription diet \npills between 2018 and January 2021 while trying to lose weight. She made one \nsubsequent mistake in March 2022, when she used marijuana in a misguided attempt to \nalleviate nausea. She has not engaged in illegal drug use since then, and she has not \nbeen tempted to do so. She married her boyfriend in 2021, and they do not socialize \nwith anyone who uses illegal drugs. She no longer works in bars and restaurants where \nillegal drugs might be more accessible. She has a more mature attitude and a healthier \nlifestyle. She consistently and credibly attested that she has no intention to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. Mitigation is somewhat undercut by her admitted falsification about \nthe full extent of her drug use on her June 2020 SCA (discussed under Guideline E, \nbelow). However, I found that her remorse for her prior conduct (under both guidelines) \nwas credible, and with limited exception, her illegal drug use is not recent. She has \nchanged her career, married, and has disassociated her from the people she used \nillegal drugs with in the past. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(1), (2), and (3) all apply, and drug \ninvolvement security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful or candid answers during national security \neligibility investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; \nI considered the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and   \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use, analyzed above under Guideline H, is cross alleged \nas a personal conduct security concern under Guideline E. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It might have \nbeen alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) as well, but it was not. AG \u00b6 16(c) \napplies. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) also applies to her drug use, not only as to the conduct itself, but \nas to the fact that she concealed its full extent on her June 2020 SCA, precisely \nbecause she was embarrassed about it and feared it would cost her professional \nstanding (her job). AG \u00b6 16(g) applies, since Applicant associated with persons involved \nin criminal activity when she used the marijuana, the cocaine, and the prescription diet \npills. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed her marijuana use on her June 2020 SCA, but deliberately \ndid not disclose either her two instances of cocaine use or her misuse of prescription \ndiet pills, both of which had occurred during the previous seven years. She had a duty \nto disclose them in answer to the \u201cseven-year\u201d illegal drug use question on her June \n2020 SCA, and deliberately did not do so. Though it is understandable that she was \nembarrassed about reporting the full extent of her conduct and fearful about the impact \non her career, that does not excuse her lack of candor. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b and 2.c. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under \nGuideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use itself, that conduct is mitigated \nunder Guideline E under the same rationale as it is mitigated under Guideline H \nabove. AG \u00b6 17(e) also applies, since Applicant has now fully disclosed her prior \ndrug use and is no longer vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress because of \nit. She also no longer associates with the people with whom she used marijuana or \ncocaine, nor the person from whom she procured the diet pills. AG \u00b6 17(g) also \napplies. \nApplicant also disclosed the full extent of her illegal drug use on her April \n2022 SCA, including with updated and more recent timeframes, and she discussed \nher conduct fully during her background interview a month later. She was not \ninterviewed after her 2020 SCA due to the COVID pandemic. While there might well \nhave been opportunities to come clean earlier than she did, this is not clearly \nestablished. Applicant was also genuinely remorseful about her past conduct, and \nshe owned up to her previous lack of candor without reservation. I found her \nexplanations and her expressions of remorse credible. She has also matured, and \nnow has a better understanding of the importance of full candor in the security \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclearance process and in a cleared environment. \nApplicant\u2019s full candor was not exactly \u201cprompt,\u201d nor is falsification of a \nsecurity clearance application (particularly about illegal drug use) ever to be \nconsidered a \u201cminor\u201d offense. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) otherwise apply. \nApplicant acted in good faith in disclosing the full extent of her illegal drug \ninvolvement on her 2022 SCA, and I believe she can be trusted to be fully candid in \nthe future as well. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns as required for tax \nyears 2010 through 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1(a) and 1(b)). An IRS tax account transcript \nindicated that in 2022, he owed $11,694 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year \n2012 (SOR \u00b6 1(c)). AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018) A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) \nApplicant submitted an SF 86 in 2021, and he was interviewed the same year. \nHe responded to DoD interrogatories in 2022. He was under notice that his unfiled tax \nreturns and unpaid taxes were a concern to the DoD. He still has not filed any tax \nreturns, and he has not paid his back taxes. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. His tax issues are recent and ongoing. His \nfailure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In her January 2023 answer to the SOR, she admitted owing the \ndebts. Her mother and father originally cosigned for the loans between 2008 and 2011. \nThe mother made the student loan payments until she passed away in 2011. Applicant \nclaims that she, her father, and her brother, have been paying on the debts over the \nyears. See January 2023 answer to the SOR, attachment. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 33 years old and single with no children. In May 2013, she earned \nher bachelor\u2019s degree in exercise science. She has about a one and a half years to go \nto receive a master\u2019s degree in project management. (GE 1 at 12; Tr. 7-8) Since April \n2019, Applicant has been employed as a recruiting coordinator of engineers. She was \npreviously employed as an administrative research assistant from October 2017 to April \n2019. From March 2016 to October 2017, Applicant worked as a receptionist and \nbenefits coordinator at a physical therapy clinic.

Applicant\u2019s father is retired from state employment, and \nher mother was nursery school director. (GE 4 at 4-5; Tr. 25, 34, 39) \nOver the life of the four listed student loans, Applicant never made payments on \nthe loans because her mother paid all the household bills, including the student loans \nwhich she paid upon receipt of the loan notices. (Tr. 47) When she passed in 2011, \nApplicant\u2019s father fell behind on paying the loans and they defaulted at some time. The \ndelinquent loan notices were initially sent to her father since he had also cosigned for \nthe listed loans. (Tr. 38, 39) At the time her mother died, Applicant did not know what \nthe monthly payments were. She could not recall when the listed student loans \ndefaulted in her name because she was living in another state. \nApplicant claimed that she called the listed state lender a few years after her \nmother\u2019s death, but they told her that she would have to repay the interest first.

Applicant did not provide \nsufficient detail about the three options, but agreed that the new settlement agreement \nwould call for a total monthly payment of $1,200 for the four loans. She could not meet \nthe settlement payment option. (Tr. 37-38) \nDuring the December 2023 hearing, Applicant provided testimony that she has \nbeen paying eight student loans to a second student lender monthly since 2013. She \nprovided documentation of paying the second student lender $143 in December 2023 \nby automatic withdrawal from her checking account. (AE C at 1-2) The exhibit also \nincludes documentation from a third student loan lender indicating that her father is \npaying $283 a month on a student loan that is only his responsibility, with an \noutstanding principal balance of $5,585. (AE C at 3-5) \nThe credit bureau reports show that Applicant pays all her bills in a timely \nmanner except for the listed student loans. (AE 3, 4, 5) She paid off her car loan and is \nresponsible with her finances. Applicant is current on the eight student loans to the \nsecond student lender. (Tr. 23; GE 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant earns about $1,873 a month after taxes. Her expenses amount to \n$1,500 a month. After payment of her expenses, she estimated she has a $600 monthly \nremainder. After putting $500 in savings every month, she has about $100 remaining. In \nher checking account she has $1,800. She has multiple savings accounts. One account \nthat is earmarked for rent contains $22,000. A savings account through her job contains \n$9,000. She has a mental budget that is not in writing. She has never had financial \ncounseling. Though she owns her car, she does not want to use it for collateral to raise \nmoney. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 29-34, 43-44) \nOn January 4, 2024, Applicant (identified as borrower) and the state lender of \nthe four listed SOR loans entered into a settlement agreement with the state lender \nagreeing to a accept $120,000 without additional interest as final settlement of the listed \nloans listed in the SOR (8515701, 9514518, 10509943, 11510842), conditioned upon \nApplicant\u2019s compliance with repayment terms of 240 monthly installments of $500 \nbeginning on January 15, 2024. After nine out of ten consecutive payments have been \nmade, the loans will be considered rehabilitated, thereby removing the defaulted status \nof the loans from the Applicant\u2019s credit report. If, after the rehabilitation period, Applicant \ndefaults on the agreement for a period of more than 180 days, the loans will be \nremoved from a rehabilitative status and transferred to a defaulted status. Then, the \nloans will no longer be eligible for rehabilitation. Upon default, the state lender may file \nsuit and enter judgment against Applicant to recover remaining amounts due on the \nlisted loans, including all accrued interest and attorney fees. Applicant made the first \n$500 payment on January 3, 2024.

Regarding her \nfather\u2019s payment contribution, Applicant was certain that he made payments, but she \ndid not know how much. (Tr. 18) On the subject of Applicant\u2019s purported payments to \nthe listed student loan debts before the issuance of the SOR in December 2022, she \nclaimed that she and her father have been paying as much as they could each month. \n(Applicant\u2019s January 2023 answer to the SOR) She claimed that she made occasional \npayments to the listed creditors during the pandemic (2020 to 2022). (Tr. 47) The record \nshows that Applicant\u2019s payments on the listed student loan accounts did not begin until \n2023. In that year, she made 11 or 12 monthly payments totaling $600 to the collection \nfirm representing the listed state lender. Hence, her claims regarding earlier payments \nare unsupported and therefore not credible. She has presented no documentation, i.e., \nbank statements, receipts, or payment ledgers, or documentation from her father or \nbrother to support her claims. The credit bureau reports show no payment activity on \nthe listed accounts from 2018 to January 2023. See, GE 3, 4, and 5. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nFailing to manage personal finances in a responsible manner can have a \nnegative impact on an applicant\u2019s safeguarding classified information. If she shows \nirresponsibility with her personal finances, she may demonstrate the same imprudent \nattitude toward security rules and regulations that she chooses not to abide by. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government\u2019s credit reports \nestablish that the debts listed in the SOR became delinquent in June 2018. The total \namount of debt posted in the SOR is $98,327. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) \ndoes not apply based on Applicants track record of payments to satisfy the unalleged \nsecond lender. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not available for mitigation. The student loan accounts were \nopened between 2008 and 2011. Applicant claimed that she, her father, and her brother \npaid on the student loans over the years and occasionally during the pandemic between \n2000 and 2022. Though the record shows payment activity until 2018, the record shows \nno evidence of payments on the listed debts at any time by Applicant until 2023, when \nshe began paying $50 a month on the delinquent loans. The payments did not begin \nuntil after she received the SOR in December 2022. Applicant\u2019s lack of evidence \naddressing the student loans before 2023 continues to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay on the listed delinquent loans cannot be based on \nemployment issues, as she has been continuously employed since 2016. There is no \nrecord of any kind of unexpected event that contributed to her delinquent loans. In \naddition, there is no evidence that she acted responsibly before she received the SOR \nin December 2022 to address the delinquent loans. See ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018) AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as Applicant has not had financial counseling. \nThough there is some evidence that she lives frugally, she did not furnish evidence of \nfinancial strategies, i.e., a written budget, or other accounting system, that could \ncontinuously enable her to monitor her financial obligations. \nWhile Applicant warrants some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) based on the \nJanuary 2024 settlement agreement, the mitigation due is insufficient to overcome the \nlack of evidence of loan payments by Applicant before 2023. In addition, based on the \nfigures that she provided regarding her income and expenses, it will be difficult for her to \nabsorb an additional $500 a month expense for the next 240 months without running a \nmonthly deficit. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish her case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). While an applicant is not required to show that every debt \nlisted in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution \nand has taken significant action to implement the plan.

Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 2, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAS) could not make the affirmative \nfindings required to continue a security clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations \n(Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. Applicant requested a decision be made in his case on the \nadministrative record rather than after a hearing. The Government sent a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) to Applicant on March 15, 2023.

Because there was no evidence to the contrary showing \nthat Applicant changed his request from an administrative decision on the record, on \nAugust 22, 2023, to a request for a hearing, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019 \nsecurity clearance eligibility. \nOn March 20, 2023, the law firm representing Applicant at the time, submitted a \nletter to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) requesting a hearing. The \nletter was sent to the Department Counsel who signed the FORM; whose office is in \nWoodland Hills, California. However, the letter was emailed to DOHA headquarters in \nArlington, Virginia. The hearing request never reached Department Counsel or the \nJudge before the decision was issued. Based on their recognition that a request for \nhearing was submitted before the FORM response deadline, the DOHA Appeal Board \nremanded the case to provide a hearing for Applicant. Then, according to the Board\u2019s \nremand decision, the administrative judge is required to issue a new decision. His \ndecision after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. \nDOHA issued a hearing notice on November 13, 2023, for a hearing on \nDecember 5, 2023. The hearing was conducted by Teams video teleconference. The \nAfter the conclusion of the hearing, the record remained open until December 19, 2023 \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. DOHA received no exhibits. I \nreceived the transcript on December 15, 2023. The record closed on December 20, \n2023. \nRulings on Evidence \nOn November 27, 2023, the Government resubmitted the exhibits to Applicant \nand the administrative judge; the Government remarked them as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1-10, with the 10th  exhibit being an additional credit bureau report (CBR) dated \nNovember 27, 2023, and marked GE 4.   \nFindings of Fact \nThere are 19 delinquent accounts alleged in the December 2022 SOR. All the \naccounts except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b m are credit-card accounts, finance accounts, \nthree medical accounts, three pay day loans, a lease of tires and rims, and two cable \nbills. The total amount of debt is about $17,665. The debts, including the 2012 federal \ntax debt (amount not posted in the allegation), became delinquent between the federal \ntax filing deadline in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and July 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Applicant admitted \nthat he owed the debts, and the Government credit bureau reports confirm his \nadmissions.

As a \nheavy metal welder, in 2015, he provided services to the military. Then, he returned to \nthe United States where he worked at a help desk. In 2017, he returned to the middle \neast where he was employed as a fitness program manager. (Tr. 10-13) Applicant was \nemployed as a journeyman in April 2020, installing tracking devices for military vehicles. \nHe is currently employed as a heavy equipment mechanic, maintaining and resetting \nvehicles that come in for repair. (GE 1 at 15; Tr 13-14) \nApplicant has been married since October 2015. He has three sons, ages 14, \n9, and 7. He has a five-year-old daughter. He has held a security clearance since 2012, \nand eligibility for a public trust position since May 2019. He indicated that he has \nreceived credit counseling assistance, but the only reference to counseling in the record \nis affiliation with two or three debt consolidation services. (GE 1 at 36-38, 48-49) \nIn his December 10, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant explained \nthe reasons for his financial problems. A top reason was that his two-family income was \nreduced to one income when his wife was unable to work for six years. He implied that \nhe made poor financial decisions in the past, but he was becoming financially smarter. \nHe acknowledged financial debts that he is trying to resolve, but he needs time. He took \nout loans in the past because of unexpected emergencies like car repairs. (Item 5 at 10; \nItem 8 at 11) While he was intending to begin resolving the accounts in early 2022, the \ndelay was probably caused by his wife\u2019s 2022 surgery. (Tr. 66-69) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant did not file his federal tax return for 2019. In his October \n2021 electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he intended to file \nthe return in 2022. In his December 2021 PSI, he acknowledged his failure to file the \n2019 Federal return and stated again that he would file it in 2022. His reason for not \nfiling was that during his deployment in the middle east, his friends told him that while \non deployment he only had to file returns every five years. In his undated answer to the \nDecember 2022 SOR, he stated that he mistakenly believed he had three years to file \nreturns. He intended to file the 2019 return no later than December 30, 2022. \nAt the December 5, 2023, hearing, the Government sought to amend the SOR \n\u00b6 1.a by replacing the Federal tax year 2019 (which has been filed and is in the \nGovernment\u2019s possession) with Federal tax years 2018 and 2020. Accordingly, the \nallegation would read that \u201cApplicant failed to file Federal tax returns for tax years 2018 \nand 2020\u201d Documentation shows that a Federal tax return for 2019 was filed, whereas \nfederal returns for 2018 and 2020 were not filed. Applicant understood and had no \nobjection to the proposed amendment. The amendment was granted. (Tr. 24-26) \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 and 2020 federal returns were mailed on December 6, 2022.

However, he is still \nwaiting on a Form 9465 from the IRS, and then he would structure a repayment plan. \n(Tr. 26; 38-43) With no account transcript for Federal tax year 2012 in the record, it is \nimpossible to determine the action taken by Applicant to resolve the taxes for Federal \ntax year 2012.

The debt became \ndelinquent in April 2021. (GE 8 at 2) He stated that in November 2021, he would pay \ndebt in full. (GE 1 at 55) As of May 13, 2022, he affirmed that he had taken no action on \nthe debt. (GE 5 at 4, 12) In his December 26, 2022 answer to the December 2, 2022 \nSOR, he claimed that he had reached a payment agreement and would start payments \nwith the finance company beginning in December 2022. In his testimony at the \nDecember 2023 hearing, he claimed that the debt was paid and that he would provide \npost-hearing documentation to verify payment. (Tr. 27) He did not provide any post-\nhearing documents. The account is still unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 A pay day loan became delinquent in January 2022.

Once the \nagent called him with contact information he would pay the account. At the December \n2023 hearing, Applicant advised he had paid the account and would be submitting post-\nhearing documentation which he failed to submit. The account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 This is a phone company account that became delinquent in \nNovember 2020.

There is no evidence payments were made. At the \nDecember 2023 hearing, he claimed the account was paid and he would be sending \nverifying documents. (Tr. 33) There is no evidence the account was paid. The debt \nremains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 The pay day loan became delinquent in October 2018.

Applicant conceded at the hearing that he made no payments on the account. He \nhas an offer to settle the account from the creditor for half the posted amount in the \nSOR.

With no documentation, \ni.e., payment receipts, bank statements, or official documented disputes to the credit \nagencies or the specific creditor that indicate the account was paid or settled, closed, or \ndisputed, the bill is still unresolved. \nApplicant opened another credit-card account in April 2023. (GE 4 at 4) After \nthe last payment activity on the account in August 2023, it was charged off in October \n2023. The amount of the charge off was $167. (Tr. 55-58) The account is not alleged in \nthe SOR and will not be used independently to deny his security clearance application. \nHowever, the conduct will be used to assess Applicant\u2019s evidence in extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. (Oct. 26, \n2006). \nGE 2 is documentation from the Defense Information System for Security \n(DISS), which is a repository for personnel security, suitability, for the Department of \nDefense military, civilian and contractors. The DISS report reflects that Applicant \nreceived a wage garnishment in September 2019 for child support of $57 a month from \nthe state with no ending date. Applicant believes this is reimbursement he is required to \npay the state for providing medical services to his children. (Tr. 62-65) \nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife was bearing his children, she experienced serious blood \nissues that caused headaches and balance issues preventing her from working for \nabout six years.

(Tr. 66-74) No \ndocumented evidence was received. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local taxes as required. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts and managing his \ntax obligations are private matters until evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts \nand handling his tax issues in a timely fashion. Adverse evidence from credit reports \ncan usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit reports establish that the 18 of the 19 \ndebts listed in the SOR became delinquent between April 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and July \n2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies because Applicant \nhas provided no documented evidence to address the delinquent accounts. His \nunsupported claim of contacting all the creditors has no probative value unless \nsupported by documented evidence of an attempt to resolve or settle the account. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has q reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant owed about $17,665 in delinquent \ndebt to 18 creditors or collection agencies in December 2022. On December 19, 2023, \nApplicant still owes $17,665 to 18 creditors or collection agencies. His failure to take \ncharge of his delinquent debt responsibilities continue to raise doubts about his \nreliability and judgment. \nThe medical problems that Applicant\u2019s wife suffered over six years in bearing \ntheir four children, rendering her unable to work during the period, were unforeseen \nconditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control. The loss of her income until recently had an \nadverse impact on his bill-paying ability. However, for the mitigating condition to be fully \napplicable, an applicant must provide credible documented evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant receives limited mitigation under the \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). But he receives no consideration under the second prong of \nthe condition. He should have taken some documented action to contact and negotiate \npayment plans with the creditors, or at least inform the creditors of his financial plight. \nDebt consolidation services do just that, they consolidate debts. The record \ndiscloses no evidence demonstrating that Applicant has had financial counseling to \nlearn the basic mechanics of managing financial obligations. The lack of evidence of a \nwritten budget negates applicability of the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply because Applicant is not engaged in a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been married since 2015 and has four children. His jobs have \ntaken him to the middle east to provide sport fitness services to American service \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \npersons. He has also contributed his expertise to the military services as a heavy \nequipment mechanic. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that his delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. Assuming that he is relying on a limitations \nstatute to avoid responsibility because several of the listed debts have transferred to \ncollection and removed from his credit report and rendered no longer legally \nenforceable by the creditor, the debt is still significant for security clearance purposes. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) \nRelying on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to \neliminate delinquent debt. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a \ncase in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the \nSOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and has \ntaken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has no plan in place and \nhas furnished no independent evidence of payments on the past due accounts. After a \nfull review of the entire record from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 26, 2021. On \nDecember 23, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2023, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

(Tr. at 122.) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer he admitted, with explanations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, \n1.g, and 1.i. He denied, with explanations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. The SOR was \namended on March 20, 2024, adding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l, which Applicant did not object \nto. (HE II-IV; Tr. at 8-9.) Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l, with explanations. His \nadmissions are included in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old information technology (IT) consultant. He has worked \nfor his sponsor since 2017. He has held a security clearance since 2007. (GE 1; GE 3 at \n32; GE 5 at 2; Tr. at 24.) He holds various IT certifications and has taken college courses \nbut holds no degree. (GE 1; Tr. at 61.) He married in November 2017 and divorced in \nJanuary 2019 and has two children. (GE 1; Tr. at 61.) When Applicant submitted his SCA, \nhe disclosed that he failed pay the taxes due. He stated he was on a payment plan for his \ndelinquent Federal and state tax debts listed on the SOR. (Tr. 49, 50, 53, 53-54, and 54, \n55-56; GE 1.) \nFrom 2010 until 2014, Applicant earned $70,000 a year before being laid off. (GE \n1; Tr. at 25.) He found employment after about six months. He took a position paying \n$75,000 a year in March 2015, where he worked for about a year. (GE 1; Tr. at 28-29.) \nHe left in February 2016 for a higher paying position, which paid $100,000 a year. He left \nafter year because of poor performance (GE 1 at 17-18; Tr. at 30-31.) These companies \nissued him a W-2 for his work. He was unemployed from February 2017 until September \n2017, when he became employed by his sponsor. His annual salary in his current position \nis $170,000. He received a Form 1099 for his compensation from his current employer. \n(GE 1; Tr. at 34-36.) \nApplicant testified he does not have any additional delinquent tax bills not covered \nby his plans. (Tr. at 66-67.) \nApplicant failed to timely pay Federal and state income tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2011 and 2015 through 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He admits these allegations \nHe states that he was unable to initially pay the amounts due upon filing due to periods \nof unemployment between October 2014 and March 2015 and between February 2017 \nand September 2017. In his SCA he attributed his financial problems to periods of \nunemployment that got him behind, needing the money to help with family, and that he \nwas working to catch up paying his bills. (Answer; AE D; GE 1 at 46-49; Tr. at 69-78; GE \n2 at 8.) He testified that he was not overwhelmed with anything. He acknowledged not \nhaving sufficient funds withheld for tax purposes or failing to keep sufficient funds until \nthe end of the year. He stated the additional funds were \u201cjust a way to help me at that \ncurrent moment as far as just life expenses.\u201d (Tr. at 66.) \nApplicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the amount \nof $10,000 for tax year 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); in the amount of $5,427 for tax year 2018 (SOR \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6 1.f); in the amount of $21,291 for tax year 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and in the amount of \n$20,140 for tax year 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). He testified he believed he had resolved the 2011 \ndebt, which was the basis for his denial. (Answer; GE 1 at 46; Tr. at 68-69.) In his Answer \nand testimony, he explained he entered into a payment plan with the IRS and had \nresolved tax year 2018. He cites the IRS website indicating he had fully satisfied the 2018 \ntax debt on December 19, 2022. (Answer; AE G, AE H; Tr. at 54.) The only remaining tax \ndebts were for tax years 2019 and 2020. He testified he had entered into a payment plan \nwith the IRS for all tax years with remaining balances for 2019 and 2020. He is required \nto make a $700 monthly payment to the IRS for tax years 2019 (remaining balance \n$19,141) and 2020, which has increased due to interests and penalties. (Answer; AE I, \nAE J, AE K; Tr. at 54-57.) \nApplicant is indebted to his state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $4,876.00 \nfor tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); in the amount of $2,164 for tax year 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); in \nthe amount of $4,701 for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and in the amount of $4,463 for tax \nyear 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). In his Answer and testimony for all of the state tax debts he \nexplained he had entered into a payment plan with the state requiring a monthly payment \nof $540.66. He pays $600. As of January 2024, his balance is $12,614.31. AE E showed \nthe balance back in April 2023 at $17,5058.76. He provided AE Y, which stated his \npayment agreement as of January 22, 2024, was active along with a screen shot of his \nmonthly installment payment. He does not have a document establishing the plan, which \nhe states goes back to 2020. (Answer; AE E, AE F; AE Y; Tr. at 59-60.) \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2021 and 2022 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l). He denies these allegations. (Tr. at 57-59, 93.) He \nexplained that the IRS and state had received his tax returns but had not processed them. \n(AE B, AE C, AE U, AE Z; Tr. at 57-58; 77-78, 93.) He testified his tax preparer had \nreceived an acknowledgement that his 2021 and 2022 state returns had been accepted, \nbut he had not provided that documentation. He provided his Federal 2022 tax return and \nIRS account transcripts. He filed for an extension for tax year 2021. (AE U, AE Z.) He \ntestified he owes $9,290 for 2021 and $11,925 for 2022. (AE U; Tr. at 81.) These tax \ndebts are not part of the installment agreement with the IRS or the state. (Tr. at 96.) \nApplicant testified he used the money owed the IRS and state to meet other \nobligations. He stated \u201cI can afford to pay it. As I said before, the extra money was used \nto help in my current situation.\u201d (Tr. at 107.) He cited \u201clife expenses\u201d for why he got behind \non paying his tax debts. He stated \u201cchildcare, other obligations, other bills that I have\u201d and \nwhen asked again for more detail he stated \u201call my other bills that I have currently open, \nsir. Credit cards, phone bills.\u201d He stated there were no other debts not already listed under \nmonthly expenses on the April 2023 financial statement he provided. The net remainder \non his financial statement was just over $6,400. (AE L; Tr. at 115, 117.) \nApplicant\u2019s installment agreements reflect he makes his payments on time. In \nresponse to whether he considered putting more money towards his tax debts he stated, \n\u201cThat's what I do. So normally, I'll just save the money, and then that's where a lot of my \nlump sums will come from.\u201d The transcripts provided in GE 2 reflect random lump sum \npayments, in addition to his regular installment payments.

He is current on the debt he listed in AE L, and a March 18, 2024 \ncredit report reflects he is in good standing for his other accounts. (AE L; AE AA; Tr. at \n100, 117.) \nApplicant provided three character statements and presented three witnesses who \nattested to his character and exceptional work performance. His character letters \nsupported the testimony of his colleagues. (AE Q-R; Tr. 121-129, 130-136, 138-144.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. The mere \nexistence of a payment arrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a \nfavorable decision under Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(g). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01213 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection \nin his debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \nan applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). As with \nthe application of any mitigating condition, the judge must examine the record evidence \nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice \nversa. See ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 07, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.\u201d My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant provided strong character evidence. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor of national \nsecurity, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his Federal \nand state tax problems. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 2019, as \nan operations manager. He was unemployed from April to June 2018 and from \nNovember 2010 to February 2011. He holds two associate degrees, earned in 2010. He \nused student loans to finance this education. He has been married for five years and \nhas a stepchild from this marriage. He also has two children from a prior relationship for \nwhom he pays child support of $950 monthly. (Tr. 6, 24, 49; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had four delinquent student loans, in collection \nstatus, totaling approximately $6,260. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e) It also alleged that he failed to \nfile his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns, as required. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nStudent Loans. \nApplicant admitted the four delinquent student loans. He claimed to have made \npayments using his debit card through about January 2012 when he received a new \nbank debit card but never informed the student loan servicer about the change. He \nsubsequently changed mailing addresses and did not receive correspondence from the \nloan servicer. Applicant admitted not making any student loan payments during this \ntime. Sometime in 2019, the loan servicer effectuated a garnishment proceeding against \nApplicant and automated deductions came out of his paychecks. Sometime in 2020 or \n2021, the deductions ceased because of the pandemic relief provided by the CARES \nAct for student loan payments. Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows that all four \nstudent loans are in collection status with the dates of first major delinquency ranging \nfrom April 2017 (two loans), May 2018 (one loan), and February 2021 (one loan). (Tr. \n29-30, 43-46; GE 1-2, 5) \nRecently (no specific date provided in the record), Applicant\u2019s student loans \ncame under control of a new servicing provider. In July 2023, Applicant set up a \npayment plan with the provider and made his first $60 monthly payment on October 2, \n2023. The payments are set up to come out of his bank account monthly. The current \nbalance on these student loans is approximately $5,212.

He testified that he cannot confirm that they have now been filed. He also \nhas not filed his 2020 federal return and he does not know if his 2021 federal return was \nfiled. (Since the non-filing of his 2020 and 2021 returns was not alleged in the SOR, I \nwill not use this evidence for disqualification purposes, however, I may use it for \ncredibility, determining mitigation, and in assessing the whole-person factors.) (Tr. 27, \n37-38; SOR answer; GE 1-2) \nApplicant explained that he got into his tax difficulties in approximately 2018, \nwhen he decided to change his W-4 tax withholding form so that nothing was deducted \nfrom his paycheck to make the monthly payments towards his federal taxes. He called \nthis process \u201cgoing exempt.\u201d He took this action so he would have more money \navailable to pay other financial obligations. He now understands he made a poor \ndecision in that regard. When it came time to file his 2018 federal tax return, he did not \nhave the funds to pay the amount he owed, so he did not file a tax return. He did the \nsame thing regarding his 2019 and 2020 federal returns for the same reason. He knows \nhe owes \u201ca good amount of money\u201d for these tax years. (He resides in a state that does \nnot have a state income tax.) (Tr. 25-28; GE 4) \nOn June 25, 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In it he \ndisclosed that he failed to file his 2018 and 2019 federal returns and the reason for \ndoing so. He estimated that he owed a total of $30,000 in taxes for these two years. \n(Since the failure to pay his 2018 and 2019 taxes was not alleged in the SOR, I will not \nuse this evidence for disqualification purposes, however, I may use it for credibility, \ndetermining mitigation, and in assessing the whole-person factors.) On June 28, 2021, \nhe entered into an agreement with a tax service to assist him with filing his delinquent \ntax returns and working out a payment plan with the IRS. Even after engaging the tax \nservice, Applicant could not document that his 2018 and 2019 federal returns have been \nfiled. (Tr. 27; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant provided documentation showing he entered into an addendum \nagreement with the tax service on November 21, 2023. He did not provide \ndocumentation that his 2018 and 2019 returns were filed after signing the addendum. \nApplicant is aware of how to obtain copies of his tax account transcripts, which will \nindicate whether a certain year\u2019s tax return has been filed and the date it was received \nby the IRS. He obtained his 2017, 2018, and 2019 transcripts by using the IRS website \nin July 2022, in response to the Government interrogatories. At that time, the transcripts \nshowed that neither the 2018 or 2019 tax returns had been filed. Applicant admitted at \nhearing that he has not gone back to the IRS website to request updated transcripts for \nhis 2018 and 2019 tax returns. He also has not contacted the IRS directly about his \nnon-filed tax returns.

He is current \non his child support obligation and has never been delinquent. He also identified a non-\nSOR debt that he paid in November 2023. (Tr. 24, 32, 50, 53; AE B, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans that remain unpaid. He also failed to \ntimely file his 2018-2019 federal income tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has filed his 2018 and 2019 federal \ntax returns. He created his tax problem himself by stopping his monthly withholdings \nfrom his paycheck, which created a large tax burden at the end of these tax years that \nhe could not pay. He avoided the problem by failing to file these returns. This was a \ncondition within his control. Even though he engaged a tax service to assist back in \nJune 2021, he cannot produce evidence that it has filed these returns on his behalf. He \nproduced no evidence that either he or the tax service has made arrangements with the \nIRS concerning his unfiled tax returns or his unpaid taxes. His reliability, trustworthiness \nand judgment are called into question. None of the mitigating circumstances apply to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhile Applicant was negligent in failing to follow-up with his student loan servicer \nonce his debit card changed, he ultimately started making payments through a \ngarnishment order that ceased due to the CARES Act relief he received. He has now \nset up a monthly payment plan with his new student loan-service provider and is making \nmonthly payments. His student loan balance is declining. AG \u00b6 20(c) substantially \napplies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. However, Applicant has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility when it comes to resolving his tax \nissues. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 8 at 1-3) Applicant enrolled in a debt-consolidation plan and began making \npayments through the plan in 2018. (Item 8 at 6) Although he made consistent payments \nfor four years, he never finished the payment plan because he became ensnared in an \nonline romance scam in 2022 in which he was duped into sending multiple payments \ntotaling $15,000 to an anonymous online person masquerading as a potential love \ninterest.

Both were charged off by the \nfall of 2022. (Item 5 at 10; Item 6 at 5) \nIn October 2022, Applicant consolidated all his delinquent SOR debts into another \npayment plan. (Item 2 at 69, 84, 91) He has been paying $176 per month towards the \nplan since November 2022. By September 2023, he had satisfied the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.f. (Response at 3) \nIn addition to the delinquent commercial debts, the SOR includes delinquent \nfederal and state income tax debts, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. \nSpecifically, SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a $4,524 federal income tax delinquency for \ntax year 2021 and a $511 federal income tax delinquency for tax year 2018. (Item 4 at \n28) Applicant has been making $51 monthly payments to the IRS through an installment \nagreement since June 2019. (Item 4 at 30-35) When he did not satisfy the tax year 2021 \ndelinquency on time, it was incorporated into the installment agreement. Apart from six \npayments that were dishonored for insufficient funds, Applicant has been making the \npayments, as agreed. (Item 4 at 31, 46-48) The most recent dishonored payment was in \nNovember 2022. (Item 4 at 31) \nSubparagraph 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $1,967 in back state taxes for tax \nyear 2021. It remains outstanding. \nSOR subparagraph 1.d alleges that Applicant had two business tax liens entered \nagainst him in 2016 and 2020, totaling $198. This debt constituted a tax on a business \nthat Applicant\u2019s ex-wife owned, which he financed. (Item 12) When Applicant discovered \nthese liens, he contacted the municipality and satisfied them. (Item 2 at 2) \nApplicant continues to work on paying off his debts. In September 2023, he made \npayment arrangements to satisfy a $650 debt that was not listed on the SOR. (Response \nat 3) \n3 \n \nSOR Paragraph 3 alleges two domestic violence allegations. Specifically, on \nDecember 17, 2018, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife, a foreign national, filed a request for \ndomestic violence protective order, alleging that on December 11, 2018, around 6:00 am \nin the morning, he assaulted her in the parking lot of his apartment complex. (Item 13 at \n8) At the time of the alleged episode, Applicant and his wife had been separated for \napproximately eight months. That morning, she had gone to his apartment without \nnotifying him in advance to retrieve her immigration-related documents. (Item 13 at 8) \nWhen she rang the doorbell, he did not answer it, nor did he invite her in. Shortly after \nshe rang, however, he walked out of the home towards his car. Applicant\u2019s estranged wife \nasked him about the documents that she needed and followed him to his car. She alleged \nthat Applicant, while walking to his car, suddenly became enraged, threatened to kill her, \nand began strangling her. (Item 13 at 8). After he stopped, he punched her in the face. \n(Item 13 at 8) After the assault, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife alleged that he entered his car \nand drove away, whereupon she got into her car and \u201ctried to follow him so he could not \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nget away.\u201d (Item 13 at 8) After losing him in traffic, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife alleged that \nshe then drove towards her immigration attorney\u2019s office, called him from the car and told \nhim what happened. He advised her to return to the scene and call the police. (Item 13 at \n8-9) \nApplicant\u2019s estranged wife followed the immigration attorney\u2019s advice and returned \nto Applicant\u2019s apartment complex. At approximately 8:45 am, an apartment complex \nmaintenance worker noticed Applicant\u2019s estranged wife in the parking lot crying, and he \ncalled the police. (Item 13 at 17) The police arrived, and after taking Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nstatement, prepared a domestic violence report. In the report, Applicant\u2019s wife was \ncharacterized as \u201cupset,\u201d \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cfearful,\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d (Item 13 at 14) Moreover, the \nofficer noticed that Applicant\u2019s wife had lacerations on her neck, a swollen right eye, and \nscrapes and bruises on her palm and lower left arm. (Item 13 at 17) The police then called \nan ambulance for transport to the local emergency room. (Item 13 at 16) Before the \nambulance arrived, the police officer took pictures of the injuries, completed an incident \nreport, including a \u201cstrangulation documentation form,\u201d and issued an emergency \nprotective order. (Item 13 at 17, 22, 24) \nApplicant\u2019s estranged wife was treated at the hospital and discharged that day. \nThe intake staff noted multiple contusions. (Item 13 at 26) On December 17, 2024, \nApplicant\u2019s estranged wife filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order against \nhim. (Item 13 at 31) The court originally scheduled the hearing for January 2, 2019, and \ngranted a temporary restraining order pending the hearing. (Item 13 at 31) The case was \ncontinued until March 2019. (Item 13 at 52) \nOn February 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the request for a domestic violence \nrestraining order, denying the allegations, and moving for a restraining order against his \nestranged wife. (Item 13 at 43) He admits that his estranged wife came to his home the \nmorning of December 11, 2018, at approximately 6:00 am. However, he denies harming \nor threatening her. Instead, he said that she repeatedly hugged him, begged him for help \nto prevent her from being deported, and asked him to kiss her. Intent on getting away, \nApplicant closed his apartment door and ran to his car with his estranged wife in pursuit. \n(Item 13 at 47) After he entered the car, she then allegedly jumped into his lap before he \ncould close the door, while continuing to exclaim, \u201chelp me, baby!\u201d and \u201ckiss me, baby!\u201d \n(Item 13 at 47) He then lifted and pushed her off him, removing her from the car.

(Item 13 at 46)) \nOn March 2, 2019, the local court held a hearing regarding the competing \nprotective order motions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ruled against \nApplicant\u2019s estranged wife, concluding that she did not meet her burden of proving by a \npreponderance of evidence that abuse occurred within the meaning of the state statute, \nor that she was placed in a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm by any actions of \nApplicant. (Item 13 at 54) The court reached this conclusion \u201cdespite the injuries \nadmittedly present\u201d on Applicant\u2019s estranged wife and finding \u2018the testimony of [Applicant] \nto be sufficiently more credible than the testimony of [the estranged wife] to preclude \n[her] from meeting her burden of proof.\u201d (Item 13 at 54) The local court\u2019s decision \nconstitutes the evidence Applicant offered in support of his denial of the allegations set \nforth in SOR Paragraph 2, and cross-alleged in SOR Paragraph 3, that he choked and \npunched his wife. \nIn Applicant\u2019s reply to the FORM, he stated that his estranged wife was not injured \nwhen he left her on the morning of December 11, 2018, and that \u201cwhether or how she \nreceived those bruises or lacerations was not from me.\u201d (Reply at 1) Contrary to his earlier \nstatement when he suggested that she follow him to a nearby commercial establishment \nwhere they could talk without disrupting the neighbors, Applicant, in his reply, stated that \nhe left the apartment complex to go directly to work. (Reply at 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s estranged wife\u2019s interview with the police officer who filed the \nDecember 2018 incident report, she told him that the episode where Applicant choked \nher was not the first time he physically abused her. Specifically, one morning in March \n2018, he punched her on the shoulder \u201ca couple of times\u201d after she would not get out of \nbed to move her car away from his car so that he could drive to work, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 2.b. (Item 13 at 9) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns under this guideline are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations my indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state income tax delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant satisfied two business tax liens, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d, as well \nas a debt, totaling $863, as alleged in subparagraph 1.f. I resolve these allegations in his \nfavor. \nApplicant has been paying his delinquencies through a payment plan since \nNovember 2022. Conversely, he never finished satisfying the debt in a plan established \nearlier in 2018. Further, he incurred all these debts approximately seven years after \nfinancial problems compelled him to obtain a discharge of $41,000 of debts through the \nChapter 7 bankruptcy process. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts,\u201d applies, but has limited probative value. \nAs for Applicant\u2019s remaining tax delinquencies, he has been making payments \ntowards the satisfaction of his federal income tax debts since June 2019. However, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndespite the low monthly payments required to satisfy the federal tax debts, six were \ndishonored for insufficient funds. Moreover, Applicant has yet to develop a plan to pay his \nstate income tax delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with \nthe appropriate tax authorities to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements,\u201d does not apply.  \nGiven the recurrent nature of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, I conclude that it is \ntoo soon to conclude that he has mitigated the security concern. In reaching this \nconclusion, I also considered his irresponsible decision to spend $15,000, more than half \nthe balance of the SOR delinquencies, on someone whom he was attempting to meet \nonline. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) The FORM \nincludes evidence that Applicant choked and beat his wife on December 11, 2018, and \npunched her on the arm approximately six months earlier in March 2018. Record \nevidence includes a police report, a victim statement, emergency room hospital records, \na strangulation documentation form, and an emergency protective order. \nThis information on file is sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \n\u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, admission, and matters of \nofficial record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally \ncharged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant denies that he has ever physically abused his ex-wife. In support thereof, \nhe, raises, in essence, a res judicata argument, contending that his ex-wife\u2019s abuse \nallegations are unsubstantiated because the state court reached this conclusion when it \ndenied his ex-wife\u2019s petition for a domestic violence restraining order. \nThe concept of res judicata does not apply in ISCR cases. (ISCR Case No. 14-\n00908 at 5 (App. Bd. March 19, 2015) Instead, regardless of the earlier decisions in other  \nforums, DOHA judges have \u201can independent duty to evaluate the evidence, to make \nfindings, and to draw conclusions therefrom.\u201d (Id.) Consistent with my duty to evaluate \nthe facts independent of the decision involving Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s protective order \nmotion, I conclude that Applicant choked and punched his wife on December 11, 2018, \nas alleged in the SOR. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s injuries were corroborated by \nboth police and on-the-scene medical personnel within three hours of her encounter with \nApplicant in the morning of December 11, 2018, and she did not have these injuries before \nthe encounter with Applicant. Moreover, emergency room medical records indicated that \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s body was bruised and lacerated in the respective areas that she \nclaimed that he hit and choked her. Lastly, Applicant, in his reply to the FORM, stated \nthat after the parking lot encounter with his estranged wife ended, he left the apartment \ncomplex to go directly to work, whereas, in his statement in response to her motion for a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotective order, the parking lot encounter ended when he suggested that she follow him \nto a nearby commercial establishment where they could talk without disrupting the \nneighbors. This contradiction fatally taints his credibility, and leads me to sustain the \nallegation, set forth in subparagraph 2.b, that he hit is wife previously six months before \nthe December 2018 assault, contrary to his denial. \nApplicant\u2019s physical abuse of his spouse occurred nearly six years ago. In addition, \nsuch conduct has not recurred, and is unlikely to recur, as Applicant and his wife are \ndivorced. This raises the issue of whether the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 32(a), \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. Given the brutality of \nApplicant\u2019s assault and his failure to admit it, I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant\u2019s physical abuse of his then wife is disqualifying under this guideline for \nthe same reasons as discussed above under the criminal conduct security concern. I \nresolve subparagraph 3.b against Applicant. As for the issue of the dishonored electronic \npayments, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b, this is indicative of a financial problem rather \nthan a personal conduct concern. I resolve subparagraph 3.a for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;(5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conclusions and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

He is single and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. at 60.) Applicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for at least tax years 2013 through 2021, as required (SOR 1.a and 1.b). He testified he believed he was late on the initial return for 2013. When he did the calculations each year, he determined he did not owe any taxes and would be getting a refund, so he put it off. He never got around to filing his taxes because he figured the worst that could happen was, he would not get his refund back, and he was \u201cokay\u201d with that consequence. The situation \u201cjust sort of snowballed\u201d for the next several years. (Tr. at 65.) He explained he thought he read that a person did not have to file if they were going to get a refund, but he could not recall where he got that idea from.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 10, 2020. On \nDecember 12, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 6, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 30, 2023, \nand the case was assigned to me on November 6, 2023. On November 21, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for December 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old software lead. He has worked for his sponsor since 2013 \nand has worked for his employer since 2004. He has held a security clearance since \nMarch 2003. (GE 1; GE 3 at 32; GE 5 at 2; Tr. at 62.) He has taken community college \ncourses but holds no degree. (GE 1; GE 4; Tr. at 61.) He is single and has no children. \n(GE 1; Tr. at 60.) \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2013 through 2021, as required (SOR 1.a and 1.b). He testified he believed he was \nlate on the initial return for 2013. When he did the calculations each year, he determined \nhe did not owe any taxes and would be getting a refund, so he put it off. He never got \naround to filing his taxes because he figured the worst that could happen was, he would \nnot get his refund back, and he was \u201cokay\u201d with that consequence. The situation \u201cjust sort \nof snowballed\u201d for the next several years. (Tr. at 65.) He explained he thought he read \nthat a person did not have to file if they were going to get a refund, but he could not recall \nwhere he got that idea from. He was not concerned about getting his refund money back \nbecause he did not need it. (Tr. at 66.)  \nIn response to Government interrogatories Applicant provided an explanation for \nhis failure to file his Federal and state tax returns. \nIt was my understanding perhaps incorrectly that if at the end of the year \nfilings the result was getting a refund that it was not necessary unless I owed \nadditional taxes beyond those already withheld throughout the year. My W-\n4 form has me taking no ded[uc]tions at all - not even myself - meaning that \ntaxes withheld are maximized for any income I make. At the end of the year \nonce I finally include myself as a deduction and include any additional \ndeductions such as mortgage and local taxes it results in a substantial \nrefund. I have no additional income other than some dividends which have \nyet to [exceed]  taxes withheld throughout the year. \nApplicant explained his calculation process further in his testimony, which he did \nfor each tax year. (Tr. at 83-84.) He received refunds in every year but one state tax year. \nHe had no explanation for why he did not file that state tax return, given the system he \nused. He stated \u201cI think that it -- I don\u2019t remember why that one came up, why that one \nended up owing because I didn't owe anything in the Federal tax. I have no idea why that \nparticular year that, the Federal or the state required a payment.\u201d (Tr. at 99.) \nApplicant told the investigator in his March 2020 security clearance interview he \n\u201chad not paid\u201d state income tax and was in the process of finding a tax consultant to help \nhim file for all years they had discussed (2012-2018). He told the investigator he was \ntrying to refinance his mortgage and the refinance package required proof of him filing \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntaxes. He told the investigator he would \u201ccontact an accountant by next week and rectify \nall outstanding taxes...\u201d (GE 5 at 5; Tr. at 89.) He never refinanced his mortgage. (Tr. at \n99.) He testified all the alleged tax years in SOR had been filed in March 2023. (Tr. at 67.) \nHe supported his testimony with documentary evidence and the testimony of the certified \npublic accountant (CPA) who prepared the returns. He hired the CPA in March 2023. (AE \nC; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. at 22-36; 81-82.) When asked about the SCA question inquiring \nabout whether an applicant had failed to file their Federal or state taxes and why he waited \nuntil March 2023 to address the tax returns, he stated the SCA says \u201cby law or ordinance. \nSo, that makes me think that if it's required by law or ordinance you need to file. And I \ndidn't think it was required because I was getting a -- in my mind I was getting a refund.\u201d \n(Tr. at 86.) \nApplicant completed an SCA in October 2013, in which he listed he had not filed \nhis 2011 Federal and state income taxes. (GE 3 at 34.) He admitted that prior to 2013 he \nhad failed to timely file his Federal and state tax returns for 2011 and 2012. (GE 3; Tr. at \n92-94, 100.) In his 2013 security clearance interview he told the investigator he was \ndelinquent in filing his taxes because he lost his W-2 and mortgage documents, and it \nwas difficult to find the necessary documents to file his taxes for the two years in question. \n(GE 4 at 3.) He testified he appreciated the importance of good finances when he was \ntrying to buy a house in 2005 and was attempting to get some of the money back in order \nto have a down payment on the house. (Tr. at 82.) He is financially capable of meeting \nhis financial obligations with an estimated net worth of over $2.2 million. (Tr. at 73; AE H; \nAE I.) It was not until he received the SOR and that: \n[T]he idea that I was going to lose my clearance started becoming -- not a \nreality but a concern that because of this this other thing might happen. \nThat's when I started to realize that something was -- that was wrong and \nthat I needed to get, you know, professional guidance.-. . . (Tr. at 102.) \nApplicant provided character statements and presented witnesses who attested to \nhis character and exceptional work performance. His performance evaluations supported \nthe testimony of his colleagues. (AE B; AE L.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n\u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c), and 19(f), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. Discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant documented that he had recently filed his outstanding Federal and state \nincome tax returns in March 2023, about four months after receiving the SOR and three \nyears after he told an investigator that he \u201chad not paid\u201d state income taxes they had \ndiscussed, which included the alleged years of 2013 through 2018. He also told the \ninvestigator he would contact an accountant and rectify all outstanding taxes. His \nbehavior was not infrequent, and he filed his Federal and state income tax returns only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy, which casts doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2021. Failure to timely file Federal and \nstate income tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). The Appeal Board has noted in the past, a clearance \nadjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an \napplicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local \n473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). His \nexplanation that he was owed a refund in all but one year and did not believe he needed \nfile as a result was not supported by any legal authority. His failure to ensure he was \ncompliant with tax laws demonstrates poor judgment and lack of reliability required to be \ngranted access to classified information. He acknowledged that on a prior SCA he had \nfailed to file his taxes in earlier tax years as required. See ISCR Case No. 17-03049 (App. \nBd. May 15, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) . See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd.

He received Federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant filed his overdue Federal and state income tax returns \nwhen he realized his clearance was in jeopardy. However, the Appeal Board clarified that \neven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] Federal [or \nstate] tax problem, and the fact that [a]pplicant is now motivated to prevent such problems \nin the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness \nin light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a \nfailure to timely pay Federal income taxes when due.

June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nUnder all the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2021 are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.\u201d My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant provided strong character evidence. He admitted that he made errors; \nhe intends to learn from those mistakes; and he promised not to repeat them. He has \nprovided contributions to his employer and the national defense as evidenced by his past \nperformance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant\u2019s failure to take timely, prudent, responsible, good-faith \nactions from 2013 to 2021 (when those tax returns were due) to timely file his tax returns \nraise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely filing his tax returns, he \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

This \namount of time is standard when a month-to-month rental agreement is terminated.

She did not provide any documentation showing the \namount of the purchase or the taxes paid, or state how she was able to do this while her \nhusband was out of work.

(Answer; Response). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s background interview and the credit reports in the record. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of the SOR debts are resolved or being paid, or that they became delinquent \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. She also failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of her current financial situation, evidence which might establish her ability \nto address her debts responsibly. Her failure to pay her delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, \nand not isolated. Her failure to meet her financial obligations continues to cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. While her husband\u2019s unemployment was beyond her \ncontrol, she failed to provide sufficient evidence that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) could potentially apply, because Applicant provided documentation that \nshe was working with a credit repair agency. However, she did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation of payment arrangements, payments made, or resolution of any of the \nSOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) could potentially apply, because she provided documentation that she \nwas working with a credit repair agency to remove negative items from her credit report. \nHowever, she did not provide sufficient documentation to substantiate the basis for the \ndispute or show that any of the SOR debts had been successfully challenged. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered her military service. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of her delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial \nindicators. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and recent. The \nfamily separation was a circumstance that is not likely to recur, but Applicant admitted \nthat the delinquent debts were due to excessive spending and financial mismanagement. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. The family separation due to the illness and death \nof Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was largely beyond his control, but he admitted that the \ndelinquent debts accumulated during the family separation were largely due to excessive \nspending and financial mismanagement. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial \ncounseling. However, the debts alleged in the SOR are resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. At the hearing, Applicant promised to start making \npayments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b in February 2024, and he testified that the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e had been settled, but he submitted no documentary \nevidence to support his testimony. After the hearing, he submitted evidence that all four \ndebts were resolved in January 2024. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was resolved by \ngarnishment of his wages. However, payment by involuntary garnishment is not a good-\nfaith resolution of a debt. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). Applicant \ntook no significant action to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e \nuntil he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. Payment of debts under the \npressure of avoiding revocation of a security clearance does not constitute a \u201cgood-faith \neffort.\u201d An applicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and the favorable comments from his coworkers. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicants eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 56, is married with two daughters, ages 30 and 23. He earned his high school diploma in 1985. He honorably served the U.S. Navy on active duty from 1986 through 2006. Since his military retirement, he has been employed by two different defense contractors as an aviation mechanic. He has worked for his current sponsor since 2011. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2014, following the favorable adjudication of his 2013 EQIP. (Items 4, 6; Item 9 at 32) Applicant was charged with violent criminal offenses three times, in 1989, April 2010, and 2018; and with alcohol-related criminal offenses twice, in 2002 and November 2010. He reported information about the November 2010 incident on his 2013 EQIP, and the 2018 incident on his 2018 EQIP. The SOR allegations raised both criminal and personal conduct concerns under Guidelines J (SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.e) and E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) with respect to the five incidents, but not regarding his omission of relevant derogatory information from his 2013 and 2018 EQIPs. In his Answer, he admitted all five Guideline J allegations but did not respond to or otherwise address the Guideline E allegation. Although the allegation incorporated the same facts to which he admitted under Guideline J, I find that he denied SOR \u00b6 2.a because it raised a separate security concern.

On February 21, 2023, the Government \nsent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 11. He was \ngiven an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on March 22, 2023, and timely responded by submitting four evidentiary \ndocuments. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nEvidentiary Matters \nApplicant appended to his Answer two evidentiary documents, which are admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and B without objection. The four evidentiary \ndocuments comprising Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM are admitted into evidence \ncollectively as AE C without objection. Items 1 through 3 contain the pleadings in the \ncase. Items 4 through 11 are admitted into evidence without objection. Although Item 5 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, I conclude that Applicant waived \nany objection to Item 5. The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice \nadvising him of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 5 on the ground that it was \nnot authenticated. He was also notified that if he did not raise an objection to Item 5 in his \nresponse to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 56, is married with two daughters, ages 30 and 23. He earned his \nhigh school diploma in 1985. He honorably served the U.S. Navy on active duty from 1986 \nthrough 2006. Since his military retirement, he has been employed by two different \ndefense contractors as an aviation mechanic. He has worked for his current sponsor since \n2011. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2014, following the favorable \nadjudication of his 2013 EQIP. (Items 4, 6; Item 9 at 32) \nApplicant was charged with violent criminal offenses three times, in 1989, April \n2010, and 2018; and with alcohol-related criminal offenses twice, in 2002 and November \n2010. He reported information about the November 2010 incident on his 2013 EQIP, and \nthe 2018 incident on his 2018 EQIP. The SOR allegations raised both criminal and \npersonal conduct concerns under Guidelines J (SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.e) and E (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) with respect to the five incidents, but not regarding his omission of relevant \nderogatory information from his 2013 and 2018 EQIPs. In his Answer, he admitted all five \nGuideline J allegations but did not respond to or otherwise address the Guideline E \nallegation. Although the allegation incorporated the same facts to which he admitted \nunder Guideline J, I find that he denied SOR \u00b6 2.a because it raised a separate security \nconcern.

Currently have attorney representation to file petition and motion \nseeking withdrawal of plea and dismissal of the case with reduction of case \nfrom a felony to a misdemeanor.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government.

Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant was charged with four violent criminal offenses in 1989, despite his \nprotestations to the contrary. However, there is insufficient record evidence to establish \ncriminal conduct on Applicant\u2019s part in connection with the incident. Accordingly, I find \nSOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. With respect to the criminal charges alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b through 1.e, the record establishes the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct spanned a period of more than 15 years from age 35 \nthrough 50. Although he benefited from dismissals of the 2010 and 2018 DV charges \ninvolving his wife, and from a reduction of the 2018 felony assault conviction involving his \neldest daughter to a misdemeanor, his underlying criminal conduct remains security \nsignificant. He drove his vehicle after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol in 2002 \nand 2010, pushed his wife in 2010, and assaulted his eldest daughter with a deadly \nweapon in 2018. Collectively these incidents demonstrate a pattern of questionable \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment and cast doubt about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nWhile Applicant has not been charged with a crime since 2018, the nature and \nextended history of his criminal conduct preclude mitigation. His three convictions \ninvolved serious criminal misconduct. Although he demonstrated a pattern of modified \nalcohol consumption since his 2010 DUI, the eight-year gap between his two DUIs and \nthe high BAC level registered both times undercut mitigation. He has exhibited a troubling \npattern of violent behavior toward his family. The fact that the court found sufficient cause \nto issue a three-year DV protective order protecting not only Applicant\u2019s eldest daughter, \nbut also his wife and youngest daughter, from him denotes the severity of his misconduct \nduring the 2018 incident. That he put himself and others in harm\u2019s way by driving his \nvehicle under the influence of an excessive amount of alcohol even once is problematic. \nFurther exacerbating the concern is that he did so a second time, after he was convicted \nof the same offense; and after his 2013 interview, during which he not only discussed the \nsecurity significance of his first DUI, but also professed an intent to modify his alcohol \nconsumption and to avoid driving after consuming alcohol. \nAlthough not raised as concerns in the SOR, in evaluating mitigation and the \nwhole-person concept, I have considered Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on his 2013 and 2018 \nEQIPs and during his 2013 and 2020 interviews. Of particular concern is his omission of \nrelevant derogatory information from the 2018 EQIP since similar issues were raised \nduring his prior investigation. Moreover, during the 2020 interview, Applicant denied being \ncharged with any criminal offenses in connection with the 1989 incident or ever having \nmet the alleged victim. He also attributed the alcohol present in his system at the time of \nhis 2010 DUI arrest to alcohol he consumed the night before. I find these statements \ntroubling because they not only raise questions about his credibility, but also suggest an \nattempt to minimize the scope of misconduct for which he was convicted. \nIn light of the record as a whole, including the misconduct for which he was not \nconvicted, I do not find a sufficient passage of time, nor a sufficient pattern of modified \nbehavior, for me to conclude that Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment and misconduct are \nunlikely to recur. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness, and his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline, as set out in AG \u00b6 15, includes: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline J, I find the personal conduct \nconcerns raised by the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. With respect to the \npersonal conduct concerns raised by the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, the \nrecord establishes the general concerns involving Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and the following specific disqualifying \ncondition forth in AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline J, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns raised by his criminal history. Moreover, \nthe nature and extent of his criminal history makes him vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. He took steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability by \ndisclosing certain derogatory information on his 2013 and 2018 EQIP and during his 2013 \nand 2020 interviews. Moreover, his 2018 felony conviction was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor. However, his continued attempts to minimize the scope of his misconduct, \nincluding by emphasizing legal consequences over accepting full responsibility for his \nbehavior, suggest ongoing concerns about his susceptibility to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress; and further undermine confidence in his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his unresolved delinquent debt. Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 30, 2023, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017.

The \nGovernment submitted its written case on September 26, 2023. The Government \nprovided Applicant a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the \nDirective. In the FORM, the Government informed Applicant that it was offering as \nevidence two subject interviews conducted in December 2019 by a background \ninvestigator. The Government advised Applicant of his ability to object to, correct, add, \ndelete, or update the information contained in the two interview summaries. The \nGovernment further advised him that failure to respond could result in a determination \nby the administrative judge that he waived any objection to the admissibility of the two \ninterview summaries. \nHe acknowledged receipt of the FORM and attached documents on October 12, \n2023. He provided a response that consisted of one handwritten document reporting the \nbirth of his two children. He also submitted a copy of the nine documents appended to \nthe FORM. He did not make any revisions to the subject interviews. Accordingly, the \nattachments to the FORM are admitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9 without objection from either party. \nEvidentiary Issue \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibit 9 contains the two subject interview summaries. The \nDecember 17, 2019 subject interview reports that Applicant provide payment receipts \nfor two accounts, with the same creditors as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. However, \nthe receipts were not included as part of the exhibit. At my request, Department \nCounsel verified that the receipts were included in the investigative file and provided a \ncopy to Applicant and me on January 18, 2023. I gave Applicant until January 29, 2024, \nto lodge any objection to the documents. He did not respond. Accordingly, the \ndocuments are admitted to the record as GE 10. The email correspondence is \nappended to the record as Appellate Exhibit I. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 29, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany, as a laborer since February 2019. He completed a security clearance \napplication, his first, in October 2019. He disclosed five delinquent accounts totaling \n$15,783. The ensuing investigation revealed four additional delinquent accounts. The \nSOR alleges that he owes $30,638 on nine delinquent accounts. (GE 1,3, 5-9) \nApplicant discussed the origins of his financial problems in his first subject \ninterview on December 9, 2019. He explained that he incurred the debts financing a \nmove from State 1 to State 2 with his girlfriend when she began attending school in \nState 2 in 2016. He accumulated the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,230) 1.g ($2,413), \nand 1.h ($1,727) to pay for the airfare required for the move as well items needed to set \nup a new residence.

He did not earn enough to pay their living \nexpenses and repay the debt he incurred. He claimed to have resolved two debts with \nthe same creditor identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. On December 17, 2019, he provided \nthe investigator with receipt for two paid accounts. Because the account numbers \nreported on the receipts do not match the account numbers in the credit reports in \nevidence, it is unclear if the debts are duplicate accounts. He also told the investigator \nthat he resolved SOR \u00b6 1.i, but he could not provide any corroborating documentation. \n(GE 5,9) \nIn response to DOD interrogatories about the status of his delinquent debts, \nApplicant indicated that he had payment arrangements in place for the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. However, he did not provide any details of the \npayment arrangements and he did not provide any receipts of payment. The credit \nreports in the record do not show decreases in balances that would be consistent with \npayment plans for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \nand 1.i do not appear on the August 2023 credit report, which is the most recent report \nin the record. (GE 4-9) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant reported that he was going to work on the \ndebts through a \u201ccredit mentor.\u201d He did not offer any details of the mentorship \narrangement or details of a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. (GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2\ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to nine \ncreditors for $30,638. The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nthe following financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and,  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nNone of the mitigation conditions apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence of his efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, to include a history of debt \nrepayment or evidence of the financial mentorship he has claimed to receive. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection proceedings. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every debt \nalleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. He has not done so, therefore failing to meet \nhis burdens of production and persuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nhistory of delinquent debt. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 14, 2022, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On January 26, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; as amended, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F and J. \nApplicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn October 12, 2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for \nNovember 15, 2023. The Microsoft Teams teleconference hearing was held as \nscheduled. During the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine Government exhibits \n(GE) 1-9; Applicant offered 17 exhibits (AE) A-Q; there were no objections; and all \nproffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On November 29, 2023, DOHA received \na transcript of the hearing. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2023 SOR response, he admitted, with clarification, all of the \nSOR allegations under Guideline F. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.) He denied SOR \u00b6 2.c under \nGuideline J; he admitted in part and denied in part SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b; and he admitted, \nwith clarification, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.g. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (SOR \nresponse) \nApplicant is 30 years old. He has been employed full-time for the past two years \nby a federal contractor as a stationary engineer. He earns an annual base salary of \napproximately $75,000. He currently resides with his fianc\u00e9e, her four-year-old daughter, \nand their three-year-old son. His fianc\u00e9e does not currently work outside the home, and \nthey are expecting a baby in April 2024. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (SOR response; Tr. 16-19, 26; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR cites four financial allegations based on one event that caused the \ndelinquent debt. The status of these allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d allege four delinquent medical accounts that were placed for \ncollection in the total amount of $3,893. Applicant admitted responsibility for these \ndelinquent medical debts, but he also stated in his SOR response that he had established \na repayment plan with the creditor. The circumstances that resulted in these medical \nexpenses stem from an incident in June 2020, when Applicant suffered a medical \nemergency that required urgent medical care. He was treated at a hospital that was not \ncovered by his medical insurance plan. Applicant tried to get his insurance carrier to pay \nfor the medical expenses, but he was not successful. Based on documentation in the \nrecord, he has been making monthly payments of $125 to the creditor since February \n2022, well before the SOR was issued. Beginning in July 2022, he hired a consumer debt \nrelief program and has made approximately $100 monthly payments as agreed. These \ndebts are being resolved. (SOR response; AE A, B, K; Tr. 19-25) \nCriminal Conduct \nApplicant was arrested in February 2015 and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) and reckless driving. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He pleaded guilty to reckless driving \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was fined approximately $1,800. The DUI charge was dismissed with prejudice. His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended from July 2015 to December 2016, and he was granted \nrestrictive driving privileges from about January 2017 to February 2018. Applicant testified \nthat the court consolidated all of his fines for traffic infractions and provided \ndocumentation of his current $100 monthly payment plan with the court. (SOR response; \nAE C, D, M; GE 1, 5; Tr. 25-28) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. alleges that Applicant was arrested in December 2017 for driving on a \nsuspended or revoked license. He pled guilty and was fined approximately $300. \nAlthough Applicant was granted restricted driving privileges, as noted above, he was not \naware that a lien had been placed on his driver\u2019s license. He resolved the lien and \nprovided proof that he currently has a valid driver\u2019s license. (SOR response; AE M, P, Q; \nTr. 28-31) \nApplicant was charged in April 2018 for operating a motor vehicle without \ninsurance. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) He denied this allegation. He stated that he had borrowed a \nfriend\u2019s car and after being pulled over by the police, he could not find the owner\u2019s \ninsurance card and he was not carrying his own insurance card. He never heard anything \nelse about this matter, and he looked up the charge with the court, but could not find any \nadditional information. There is insufficient evidence in the record of this violation. (SOR \nresponse; Tr. 31-32) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d. alleges that Applicant was charged with speeding in May 2018, and he \nwas found guilty of this offense and was fined $257. Applicant stated the fine was \nconsolidated with his other fines, and he is current on his monthly payment agreement \nwith the courthouse. (SOR response; Tr. 33-34; AE M) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. alleges that Applicant was charged in February 2019 with failure to \nrenew expired registration tags. He was found guilty and ordered to pay $280. Applicant \nstated that this fine was paid in full. (SOR response; Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant was charged in May 2020 for speeding, no valid operator\u2019s license, and \noperating a motor vehicle without insurance.

(SOR \nresponse; Tr. 35-37) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g. alleges that Applicant was arrested in September 2021, and charged \nwith felony assault (domestic violence). The charge was subsequently dismissed due to \nlack of evidence. Applicant stated that his fianc\u00e9e had been previously diagnosed with \nbipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD). That evening she had been drinking, going through withdrawal from not taking \nher medication, and she was depressed. She began deleting photos from her phone. She \ntook Applicant\u2019s phone so she could delete his photos, but she discovered he had \nchanged the passcode. She became upset and accused Applicant of being unfaithful. An \nargument took place, and she pushed and punched him, while he tried to restrain her. \nThe police arrived and his fianc\u00e9e accused Applicant of choking her.

Three co-workers reported that \nApplicant is a highly valued asset on the maintenance team. They describe him as honest, \nreliable, and trustworthy, and endorse he be granted a DOD security clearance. (AE O) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n4 \n\n \n \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be \napplicable in this case: This is indented on the right. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nThe four medical debts totaling $3,893 were generated in June 2020 after \nApplicant suffered a medical emergency. Although he carried medical insurance at the \ntime, he was taken to the nearest hospital that was not included in his medical insurance \ncoverage plan. Applicant tried to work with his medical insurance carrier to pay the \nmedical bills, but his efforts were unsuccessful. He initiated a repayment plan with the \ncreditor and has been consistently making monthly payments to resolve these medical \ndebts. \nApplicant pays his current financial obligations and has no new delinquent debt. \nHe is willing and able to live within his means, which is reflected in the testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence. The June 2020 event was a situation beyond Applicant\u2019s control, \nand I find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. The incident was completely \nunexpected and his willingness to satisfy the four medical debts demonstrates his \nresponsibility and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are applicable. Applicant \nestablished mitigation of the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence established sufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s criminal \ncharges were disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) pattern of minor offenses, any of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe SOR alleged multiple incidents that are mainly traffic infractions that do not \nestablish a pattern of criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s 2015 arrest for DUI and reckless \ndriving resulted in a conviction of reckless driving. The DUI charge was dismissed with \nprejudice. This event occurred nine years ago and there are no other repeat violations of \nthis nature. His December 2017 offense for driving on a suspended or revoked license \noccurred over six years ago. The most recent and troubling arrest for felony assault \n(domestic violence) occurred in September 2021, over two-and-one-half years ago. The \ncourt dismissed the charge against Applicant due to lack of evidence. His fianc\u00e9e \nprovided a signed statement that she was the cause of the domestic argument and \nadmitted that due to her unstable mental condition, she had lied to the police. There have \nbeen no other charges of violent behavior in Applicant\u2019s record. I find that enough time \nhas passed to ensure that future criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and 32 (d) apply. Applicant established mitigation of the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nJ are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nFor the past two years, Applicant has worked full time on a maintenance team. He \nis 30 years old, engaged, and has two children with another on the way. He experienced \na circumstance beyond his control that triggered his financial delinquency. He took \nresponsible action to remedy the problem. He has multiple traffic infractions that are not \nconsidered criminal, and his criminal conduct occurred in the distant past, with no \nevidence of repeated violations. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United States to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(GX 4) \nDuring \u201croutine monitoring of employee asset usage,\u201d company investigators \nobserved that, from April through June 2020, Applicant sent four emails from his work \nemail account to his personal email account that contained documents marked as \ncompany proprietary. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) When confronted, Applicant stated that he sent the \ndocuments to his personal email so that he could work on them at home since \u201cit was \nan inconvenience to pack up all his work assets to take home.\u201d An ICR was drafted and \nApplicant confirmed that he deleted the relevant files from his personal email and \ncomputer. He was advised of company policies regarding the use of personal email and \nreceived verbal counseling from his supervisor. (GX 4) \nDespite the counseling, in August 2020, Applicant sent another document \nmarked as proprietary and export controlled from his work email to his personal email. \nWhen confronted, Applicant stated that he sent the document to his personal email as a \ntemplate for another work project and believed the document did not contain any \nproprietary information. However, his supervisor confirmed that the documents did \ncontain proprietary information and that there was no \u201clegitimate business purpose\u201d for \nApplicant to have sent company \u201cintellectual property\u201d to his personal email. Another \nICR was drafted. This was noted as Applicant\u2019s second \u201cdata infiltration incident\u201d within \nthe last 12 months and he was issued a written warning. (GX 4) \nNone of the reports reflect that there was ever a loss or compromise of classified \ninformation during any of these incidents and Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted that \nApplicant\u2019s actions were not \u201cnefarious.\u201d When requested by his employer, he deleted \nthe relevant documents from his personal email and home computer. (GX 4) \nIn his September 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he was \u201cwritten up\u201d by his \nemployer in April 2020 because he sent a document marked \u201ccompany proprietary\u201d \nfrom his work email to his personal email. He explained that everyone was remote \nworking during the COVID pandemic and he was trying to complete an assignment to \nmaintain the program schedule. Applicant blamed the \u201crecent total encryption of all files\u201d \nfor making it \u201cimpossible\u201d to work on any computer outside of the network.

(GX 3) \nDuring his December 2021 background interview with a DOD investigator, \nApplicant again disclosed that he had received a written warning in April 2020. He \ndescribed sending a document that he was drafting from his work computer to his \npersonal email to continue working on the document. The investigator noted that \nApplicant \u201cconsidered the document to be unclassified\u201d and, at the time, was unaware \nthat he was not allowed to send the document to his personal computer. He described \nlater meeting with his supervisor about the incident and being required to review \ncompany policy on handling proprietary information. Afterwards, he claimed to \nunderstand the company policy and admitted his mistake. (GX 5) \nAlso during his background interview, Applicant stated that he had been \nemployed with the company for over 40 years and that this was the \u201cfirst incident of this \nnature that he had been involved in.\u201d He did not detail the other incidents or ICRs that \nhe had received. (GX 5) \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that he did not \u201ccompletely admit fault nor deny \nculpability\u201d regarding the incidents from 2011 through 2018. He stated that \"[company] \nproprietary\u201d was the \u201cde facto\u201d label for everything that came off the printer or that he \nworked with on the computer. He further stated that he was \u201calways under the \nassumption\u201d that he worked in a \u201csafe and secure environment\u201d and that no one was \n\u201callowed to graze through the offices and laboratories (without challenge) to examine \nand take what they wish.\u201d He also questioned company policy as he stated it was \n\u201cpeculiar\u201d that his company defined \u201cproperly secure\u201d as the use of \u201csimple office locks.\u201d \n(Answer) \nWith regard to the incidents from April through August 2020, Applicant admitted \nthe relevant allegations, but only discussed the incidents as a single event. He stated \nthat, \u201cas time became short,\u201d he sent documents to his personal email so that he could \ncomplete the task on time. He further stated that once he was notified of the error, he \ndeleted the material from his home computer that day. (Answer) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he did not provide any further \ninformation to explain or mitigate his actions. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for handling protected information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nGuideline K security concerns are not limited to violations of DOD rules and \npolices, but also encompass violations of industry rules and policies established for the \nprotection of classified and sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 15-08002 at 1 \n(App. Bd. July 17, 2018); ISCR Case No. 14-00963 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 13, 2015). \nNeither a violation of a specific rule nor an actual compromise of classified or sensitive \ninformation is required to establish a Guideline K concern if the conduct has security \nsignificance. See ISCR Case No. 11-05079 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012); ISCR Case \nNo. 20-00230 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2021). \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise\nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized\nequipment or medium; \n \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant committed numerous security violations from 2011 through 2020 by \nrepeatedly failing to secure protected information in an authorized location and \nforwarding proprietary work documents to his personal email in order to access those \ndocuments from his home computer. These actions were in violation of various rules \nestablished by his company in accordance with DOD policies and are of security \nsignificance. Although he was continually notified or counseled by his company\u2019s \nsecurity team and management to secure sensitive information, the violations \ncontinued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b), (c), (g), and (h) are established. \nOnce it is shown that an applicant has committed security violations, he or she \nhas a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in demonstrating mitigation. ISCR Case No. 14-05127 at 8 \n(App. Bd. June 24, 2016). An applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for said \nviolations will likely not meet the strict scrutiny standard of establishing reform or \nrehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 5 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 35 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns and are \npotentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant\u2019s security violations span a period of over nine years, from 2011 to \n2020. Although company records reflect numerous occasions where he received \nnotification and counseling regarding the violations, there is no evidence in the record \nestablishing that he fully recognized the significance of the violations or made \nsubstantive changes to how he managed sensitive information. \nIn his SCA and during his December 2021 background interview, Applicant only \ndescribed a single \u201cmistake\u201d that he made in April 2020 when he sent work documents \nto his personal email. He claimed he was unaware of company policy when he sent the \ndocuments but had since reviewed and understood the policy. However, he then failed \nto address why he repeated the same violation just a few months later, in August 2020. \nInstead, it is apparent that Applicant continually substituted his own assessment \nof the nature and security of the sensitive material he was handling over company \npolicy. In discussing the April 2020 incident that he disclosed in his SCA, he \nemphasized that the document at issue was something he \u201cCREATED\u201d that had \n\u201cNOTHING classified\u201d in it. During his interview, he again stated that he considered the \ndocument to have nothing classified in it. In his Answer, he further stated disagreement \nwith the company\u2019s definition of \u201cproperly secure,\u201d finding it \u201cpeculiar.\u201d \nApplicant committed numerous security violations over an extended period. \nWhile some of those violations may have been unintentional, he has shown only limited \nrecognition of the concerns or an ability to take substantive corrective action. These \nefforts fall short of his very heavy burden of persuasion as to mitigation. An additional \nviolation occurring after Applicant\u2019s disclosed \u201cmistake\u201d in April 2020 undermines \nconfidence that the violations are unlikely to recur. None of the above mitigating \nconditions are fully established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern regarding personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of protected information is cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(d) is only partially applicable because the \nalleged conduct is sufficiently and explicitly covered for an adverse determination under \nGuideline K. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(d) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns and are \npotentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple security violations that occurred over a nine-year span are \nnot minor offenses nor did they occur under unique circumstances. The recency of his \nviolations, including a violation in August 2020 after he recognized he made a \u201cmistake\u201d \nin April 2020, continue to cast doubt as to his trustworthiness, reliability and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. Although he claimed to understand his company\u2019s \npolicies, he has shown an inability or unwillingness to take corrective action. Applicant \nhas not established that future security violations are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline K and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd.

However, his \npoor management of proprietary information and his multiple security violations show a \npattern of conduct lacking in security awareness. Additionally, by sending proprietary \ndocuments to his personal email, he substituted his judgment for that of company policy \nand prioritized work over security. Even though his actions were not \u201cnefarious\u201d in \nnature, they continue to raise doubts as to his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the handling protected information and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 28, 2021. \nOn March 17, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Service (DCSA CAS) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H and E. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

(Hearing Exhibit I) The case was assigned to me on November 10, 2023. On \nDecember 1, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted on January 16, 2024. The \nhearing was postponed because of inclement weather and rescheduled for January 29, \n2024. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 2, and 3 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 6, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old business analyst employed by a federal contractor since \nJuly 2020. She has taken college-level courses but has not received a degree. She \nmarried in 2012 and divorced in 2021. She has three children, ages 16, 13, and 11. \nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since April 2006, with periods of \nunemployment from August to October 2011, November 2018 to February 2019, and \nJanuary to July 2020. She has held a security clearance throughout this employment. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA in February 2012, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?\u201d (GX 1 at 42) When she submitted another SCA in October 2021, she \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to the same question. In response to the question about the nature, \nfrequency, and number of times used, she stated, \u201cIt reduces my anxiety. Usage is once \na year at most.\u201d She estimated that she first used it in May 2002 and that her most recent \nuse was in October 2020. When asked if she intended to use it in the future, she \nresponded, \u201cTo reduce anxiety, no intent to use it again.\u201d (GX 2 at 50-51) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2022, she \nadmitted that she used marijuana from May 2002 to October 2020 \u201cwith various friends \nand acquaintances,\u201d such as a female friend and an ex-boyfriend. When she responded \nto DOHA interrogatories in March 2023, she stated that her first use of marijuana was in \nMay 2002 and her last use was in October 2020. She described her frequency of use as \n\u201crarely.\u201d She stated that she did not intend to use it in the future. (GX 3 at 2-3) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she was not sure why she did not disclose \nher marijuana use in 2002 in her 2012 SCA. She testified that she used marijuana only \ntwice in her lifetime, once in 2002 and once in 2020. (Tr. 18, 22) Her use in 2002 was \noutside the seven-year window for the question in the SCA. (Tr. 15) She was only 16 \nyears old at the time, and her 18-year-old sister, who lived in her own apartment, offered \nher marijuana. After Applicant\u2019s parents found out about her marijuana use, they \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprohibited her from going to her sister\u2019s apartment. (Tr. 43) Applicant testified that, after \nthe incident with her older sister, she did not use it again, because she was playing sports, \nwent on to college, and then was raising children. (Tr. 43-44) She decided to disclose her \nmarijuana use in her 2021 SCA, even though she knew there could be adverse \nconsequences, because she wanted \u201cto be honest.\u201d (Tr. 16) \nApplicant testified that when she used marijuana in 2020, she was finalizing her \ndivorce, her children were at home because of COVID, and she was working at home. All \nthese circumstances caused her \u201ca lot of anxiety,\u201d and she thought the marijuana would \nalleviate her anxiety, but it did not. (Tr. 20) \nWhen Applicant used marijuana in 2020, she was with a female friend that she \nlived with for about a month while she was going through her divorce and her boyfriend \nwhom she had dated for about three and a half years. Her boyfriend used marijuana \nregularly, and he provided the marijuana that she used on this one occasion in 2020. (Tr. \n31-33) She testified that her boyfriend usually did not use marijuana in her presence, \nbecause he knew that she did not like the smell and how people acted after using it. (Tr. \n34) She is no longer involved with her marijuana-using boyfriend. She still speaks with \nher female friend, but she has no personal contact because her friend moved to another \narea. (Tr. 31) \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel cross-examined Applicant about her use of \nthe word, \u201crarely,\u201d in her response to DOHA interrogatories about the frequency of her \nmarijuana use. She explained that she could not say \u201cnever\u201d because she had used it \ntwice, and she did not say \u201cfrequent\u201d because it would be incorrect, so she chose to say \nshe used it \u201crarely\u201d because it was \u201ca rare time\u201d when she used it. (Tr. 22) She testified \nthat her description of her marijuana use was \u201cjust poorly worded.\u201d (Tr. 37) \nApplicant did not report her use of marijuana to her facility security officer (FSO). \nShe testified, \u201cI knew it was an issue, but I didn\u2019t know it was something that I had to go \nreport to my FSO.\u201d (Tr. 34, 53) She is willing to submit to counseling or drug testing at \nany time. (Tr. 42) She testified that she now deals with anxiety by exercising. (Tr. 27) She \nhas not sought any treatment from a medical professional for her anxiety. (Tr. 35) \nWhen Applicant used marijuana in October 2020, she held an active secret \nclearance, but her job did not involve handling classified materials. She testified that she \nhad not had access to classified information for a \u201cvery long time.\u201d However, she holds a \npublic trust position and has access to sensitive information. (Tr. 45-47) \nA former coworker submitted a letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s dedication, attention \nto detail, reliability, and trustworthiness. (AX A) Applicant\u2019s close friend for 20 years \nconsiders her a dedicated mentor, with exceptional judgment and \u201cunwavering dedication \nto upholding the highest standards of integrity, honesty, and professionalism.\u201d (AX B) \nApplicant\u2019s FSO, who is also her close friend, describes her as \u201ca trustworthy and honest \nperson who is loyal to her work with the government.\u201d (AX C) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA friend who has known Applicant for 20 years submitted a letter attesting to her \nintegrity, reliability, and kindness.

(AX D) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nMay 2002 to October 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that she used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about May 2012 to about October 2020 while granted access to classified \ninformation (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that she used marijuana from about February 2012 to about \nOctober 2020 after submitting an SCA (SOR \u00b6 1.c). She admitted all three allegations in \nher answer to the SOR. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and her testimony \nat the hearing. However, her admission of SOR \u00b6 1.b is undermined by her testimony at \nthe hearing, where she testified that she has not had access to classified information for \na very long time. There is no evidence in the record contradicting her testimony on this \npoint. A security clearance alone does not grant an individual access to classified \nmaterials. In order to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual must have \nnot only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure \nagreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd.

I am not satisfied that Applicant\u2019s admission of this allegation was based on a \ncorrect understanding of the nature of a security clearance. I conclude that SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nnot established by her admission, but that it was sufficient to place her on notice that she \nwas alleged to have used marijuana while holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c and the evidence in the record are \nsufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nUse of marijuana while holding a sensitive position is sufficient to establish a AG \n25(f), but it was not specifically alleged. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long \nago) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There are no bright line rules \nfor determining when conduct is recent.

ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in August 2020, more than three years ago. \nHowever, it occurred after she submitted her most recent SCA and while adjudication of \nher security clearance was pending. Under these circumstances, it was \u201crecent.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s belated disclosure of her marijuana involvement in her 2020 SCA is \ncommendable. However, her testimony at the hearing that she used marijuana only twice \nin her lifetime and only once since after her most recent SCA is inconsistent with other \nrecord evidence. When she submitted her SCA in October 2021, she stated that she used \nit \u201conce a year at most.\u201d When she was interviewed by a security investigator in January \n2022, she said she used it \u201cwith various friends and acquaintances.\u201d When she responded \nto interrogatories, she said that she used it \u201crarely.\u201d It was only after she received the \nSOR and testified at a hearing that she claimed that she used it only once after submitting \nthe 2012 SCA. \u201cOnce\u201d is less frequent than \u201conce a year\u201d or \u201crarely.\u201d Her testimony at the \nhearing that she used it only \u201conce\u201d strongly suggests that she was attempting to minimize \nthe frequency of her use, because she realized after receiving the SOR that her security \nclearance was in jeopardy. Her apparent effort to minimize her earlier admissions about \nthe frequency of her drug use leaves me with doubts about the credibility of her testimony. \nIt also causes me to question her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or \nparse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information. That compelling interest includes the government's \nlegitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, based on complete and \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government \nin connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002) \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has not fully acknowledged the extent \nof her drug involvement. While she no longer associates with her marijuana-using \nboyfriend, it is not clear whether she has changed her environment. She has not \nsubmitted a statement of intent to abstain from drugs and an acknowledgement that \nfurther drug abuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified her February 2012 SCA by deliberately \nfailing to disclose her marijuana use beginning in May 2002. The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under this guideline is: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThis disqualifying condition is not established. Applicant admitted using marijuana \nin May 2002, but there is no evidence that she used it again before she submitted her \n2012 SCA. Her admitted use of marijuana in May 2002 was outside the seven-year \nwindow of the question about prior drug use. The evidence is insufficient to show that she \nfalsified her 2012 SCA. No other disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her drug involvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 13, 2023 (Answer) and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

He is 36 years old, \nmarried, and he has a one-year-old child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2016. He worked as a DOD contractor from 2012 to 2015, when he was hired as a DOD \ncivilian. Since March 2022, he has worked as a senior professional staff member for his \nemployer, another DOD contractor. He conducts artificial intelligence research and \nengineering for combat-related platforms, a position that requires a security clearance. \nHe was first granted a clearance in 2015. (Tr. 6, 19-33, 50-53, 80-81, 84-85; GE 1-3; AE \nH) \nApplicant used marijuana on three occasions from April 2021 to December 2021, \nwhile he was granted access to classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) On each occasion, he \nwas at a social gathering and he had consumed alcohol. In the spring of 2021, he was at \na friend\u2019s party and he ate a portion of a marijuana brownie. In the fall of 2021, he was at \na party and he took one puff of a marijuana cigarette that was passed around by his \nspouse\u2019s friend. On the third occasion, he was out of state at a New Year\u2019s party hosted \nby his in-laws and he took one puff of a marijuana cigarette that was passed around by \nhis brother-in-law. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C) \nThese were the only occasions in which Applicant used marijuana. He described \nhis use as experimental in nature, and he regretfully did not consider the implications that \nhis marijuana use would have on his security clearance. Although he did not access \nclassified information as part of his day-to-day job duties, he acknowledged that he \nattended optional, classified seminars between April 2021 and December 2021 and his \nsecurity clearance enabled him to do so. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C) \nApplicant did not think to report his marijuana use until he voluntarily disclosed it \non his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA). He did so, despite the potential \nconsequences on his security clearance, because he wanted to be honest. He further \ndiscussed it in his December 2022 response to interrogatories. He took responsibility for \nhis marijuana use. He also acknowledged that he violated federal law and the rules and \nregulations governing individuals with security clearances, having received annual \nsecurity trainings since 2015. (Tr. 41-50, 52, 68, 71-80, 83; GE 1-2; AE B-C) \nApplicant stated that his marijuana uses were extraordinary lapses of judgment. \nHe stated that it permanently stained his personal integrity and he is committed to \nrehabilitation. He voluntarily completed a drug and alcohol education course in March \n2022. He also voluntarily submitted to drug screens, testing negative for marijuana and \nother illegal drugs, in April 2022, November 2022, February 2023, April 2023, July 2023, \nand October 2023.

They are committed to Applicant\u2019s decision to refrain from illegal \ndrug use. He also informed his family and friends of his intent to refrain from any illegal \ndrug use and they are supportive of his decision. If he were to find himself in a situation \nwhere illegal drugs are being used, he would leave. In December 2022, he signed a \nstatement of intent to never use any illegal drugs in the future and that any violation would \nresult in him losing his security clearance. (Tr. 46-47, 61-62, 65-68, 71-73, 81-83; GE 2; \nAE A) \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s impressive educational background, he has made \nvaluable contributions as an aerospace engineer since he first started working as a DOD \ncontractor in 2012. He was awarded for his exceptional work in 2012, 2018, 2019, and \n2022. He is an esteemed member of his team, as evidenced by his stellar performance \nevaluations from 2016 to 2021. He also continues to contribute to his community. He \nprovided numerous letters of support from close friends, colleagues, a former supervisor, \nand former colleagues, some of whom were aware of his past marijuana use. All of these \nindividuals vouched for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (GE 2; AE D-G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information . . . . \nApplicant used marijuana on three occasions from April 2021 to December 2021, \nwhile granted access to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are \nestablished. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant self-reported information about his illegal drug use on his SCA and \nduring his response to interrogatories. He acknowledged that he violated federal law and \nthe rules and regulations governing individuals with security clearances. He voluntarily \ncompleted a drug and alcohol education course in March 2022 and he voluntarily \nsubmitted to six drug screens from April 2022 to October 2023 wherein he tested negative \nfor marijuana and other illegal drugs. He also chose to stop consuming alcohol in the \nsummer of 2023. He no longer associates with individuals who use illegal drugs, he \ninformed his family and friends of his decision to refrain from illegal drug use, and he \nsigned a statement of intent to abstain from all future drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana on three occasions from April 2021 to \nDecember 2021, while granted access to classified information, occurred just over two \nyears ago. An applicant who continues to use marijuana, after applying for a security \nclearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance, demonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility \nstandards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See \nISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021); See also ISCR Case No. 21-\n02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) and ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. \n21, 2023).  \nApplicant was candid, credible, and remorseful at the hearing. However, more time \nwithout marijuana use is necessary to establish his future abstinence from marijuana use \nand possession. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s impressive educational background and \nvaluable contributions to his profession. I also had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor during his hearing and he was credible, candid, and remorseful. However, the \nevidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old cost analyst employed by a federal contractor since April 2022. He was employed by various non-federal entities from August 2011 until being hired for his current position. He was unemployed for a few months in 2017, from February to September 2019, and from May 2020 to June 2021. He has more than 150 college credit hours but has not earned a degree. He never married and has no children (GE 1; Tr. 51- 53, 91-95) Applicant attributes his financial problems to unemployment, the COVID 19 pandemic, financial support for his disabled mother since at least 2012, and occasional financial support to his extended family. He said from 2015 until the start of the COVID 19 pandemic, he was doing fine until he lost his job.

Both cases were dismissed in part because he could not \nafford the required payments. Once he realized he would be getting his current job with \na defense contractor, he decided he would not finish the bankruptcy, to sell his vehicle, \nand decided to start to address the debts on his own.

(GE 5 at 8-9) Both petitions were dismissed because Applicant failed to timely \npay filing fees. (GE 5-6) \nApplicant testified he filed the bankruptcy petitions in 2010 and 2011 after he lost \nhis job and fell behind on vehicle loan payments. He was not financially literate at the time \nand his mother advised him that filing for bankruptcy was probably his best option to \nprevent repossession of his vehicle. He needed the vehicle for transportation and to assist \nhis disabled mother. He was inexperienced and did not understand the importance of \nprocedural compliance.

He submitted evidence the state approved a 60-month \npayment plan in January 2024, for a state tax debt of $1,333, and with the first monthly \npayment of $25 due on January 31, 2024.

Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k, but denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.l noting he was working with the \ncreditor and that the past-due balance had been reduced to $4,801. (Answer) Credit \nreports from July 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 show the credit accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k as assigned in January 2019, with last activity or payment in June \n2022 and March 2021, and charged off in the amounts alleged.

In September \n2022, $16,500 he obtained from sale of the vehicle was applied to the vehicle loan debt \nand reduced the balance to $4,801. (AE B) He said the creditor is amenable to resolving \nthe debts through a payment plan. He plans to set up a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor for all three debts once he has sufficient funds available. He plans to address \nthese debts before other delinquent consumer accounts. (Tr. 44-60, 83-85, 120-126) \nThese debts are not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.n: credit card accounts charged off for $2,477 and $705, \nrespectively. Applicant admitted both allegations. (Answer) Credit reports from July \n2022, April 2023 and April 2024 show the credit card accounts were opened in November \n2018 and March 2019, with last payment or activity in June and July 2019, and charged \noff in the amounts alleged. (GE 7 at 4,10, GE 8 at 4-5, GE 10 at 9-10) Applicant has not \ncommunicated with the creditors and he plans to address both debts after he resolves the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.l. (Tr. 48, 83-85, 126) These debts are not resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances have improved since he started his current job \nin April 2022. He initially earned about $83,500 a year and now earns about $87,500. (Tr. \n53-54) He estimated his net monthly income at about $4,700 after taxes.

(GE 10) Applicant submitted a \u201cFICO Score 3B Report as of April 4, 2024,\u201d \nwhich characterized his amount of debt as fair or poor, and his payment history as fair to \nvery good, his amount of new credit as poor to fair, and his credit mix as very good or \nexceptional. (AE D) This report does not identify specific debts or show debt details. \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from a former coworker and a \ncurrent colleague who works for a federal agency. They commented favorably on his \nprofessionalism, trustworthiness, integrity, compassion, work ethic, and ability to \novercome challenges.

(Tr. 99-\n106, 112-120)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence reflecting his bankruptcy \nfilings, failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns or pay taxes due, and \nother delinquent debts alleged in the SOR establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems date back to at least 2010. From July 2010 to March \n2022, he filed four Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions, and each case was dismissed \nbecause he failed to complete required actions. He had a significant amount of debt \ndischarged through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015. His most significant action on \ndelinquent consumer debt alleged in the SOR was to apply the proceeds from the sale of \na vehicle to reduce the balance of his delinquent auto loan in September 2022. The \nfollowing month he obtained a $59,523 loan to purchase a vehicle and has made monthly \nloan payments of $953 since. There is no evidence he has made any payments on the \nremaining $26,749 in delinquent consumer debt since October 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are long-standing, \nongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. His \nfinancial behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, \nunderemployment, and his family\u2019s financial problems were largely beyond his control. \nHowever, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant completed financial counseling, but his \nfinancial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nbecause it was a lawful and reasonable measure to resolve his significant debts and to \nattain a fresh start. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the Chapter 13 bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, or for the delinquent consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.n. \nApplicant can be given credit for initiating Chapter 13 bankruptcies as a means of being \nprotected from creditors but also as a way of making them partially whole. That would, \nhowever, require that he adhere to the plan\u2019s payment schedule and other requirements. \nHe did not do so on four occasions from 2010 to 2022. He has provided insufficient \nevidence to support a conclusion that he has initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort \nto repay his creditors, or otherwise resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.n. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for the delinquent federal and state income tax returns \nand overdue income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.i. Applicant filed his delinquent federal \nand state income tax returns for TY 2020 along with his TY 2021 returns in 2022. A credit \nfrom his TY 2021 federal income taxes was applied to and resolved his delinquent federal \nincome tax debt for TY 2020 as well as tax debts from TY 2013, TY 2017, and TY 2018. \nHe entered a payment agreement with the state in January 2024 to resolve his state tax \ndebt of $1,333. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nemployment history, character evidence, and honorable efforts to provide financial \nsupport to his family members, and that his financial problems were caused, in part, by \ncircumstances beyond his control. I also considered his improved financial \ncircumstances, and that he has paid some of his delinquent debts. However, he has not \ndemonstrated a reliable financial track record of addressing delinquent debts. In October \n2022, he incurred a $59,000 vehicle loan debt when he had $26,749 in delinquent \nconsumer debt outstanding. Although he has made the required vehicle loan payments, \nhe has not made a single payment on his delinquent consumer debt since. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. This decision should not be \nconstrued as a determination that he cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary \nfor award of a security clearance in the future. With a longer track record of financial \nresponsibility, he may be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nclearance worthiness. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been with her company as an hourly employee since August 2022. She served honorably in the U.S. Army for a brief period in 2011, when she was medically discharged. She is single and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. at 21, 50-51.) She attended college between 2009 and 2016 but did not obtain a degree. (GE 1; Tr. at 25.) During her time in school, she held various jobs in the service industry.

DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 11, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been with \nher company as an hourly employee since August 2022. She served honorably in the \nU.S. Army for a brief period in 2011, when she was medically discharged. She is single \nand has no children. (GE 1; Tr. at 21, 50-51.) She attended college between 2009 and \n2016 but did not obtain a degree. (GE 1; Tr. at 25.) During her time in school, she held \nvarious jobs in the service industry.  \nWhen Applicant received the SOR in February 2023, she stated she became \naware what the specific debts were that the Government was concerned about. (Tr. at \n30.) She admitted in her Answer to the following: 13 delinquent student loans totaling \nabout $56,000 (GE 2 at 2-6) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m; a delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) \ntotaling about $1,181 that had been placed in collection, which she testified had been \nresolved and she provided a letter dated December 4, 2023, stating her payment \nobligations had been fulfilled. (GE 2 at 6; AE EE; Tr. at 33.); a delinquent wireless service \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.o) for $721 that had been placed in collection, which she testified had \nbeen resolved and she provided a letter dated December 1, 2023, stating her payment \nobligations had been fulfilled (GE 2 at 7; AE DD; Tr. at 33.); and a delinquent automobile \ninsurance account (SOR \u00b6 1.p) for $226 that had been placed in collection, which she \ntestified had been resolved and she provided an email dated March 31, 2023, stating her \npayment obligations had been fulfilled with her March 31, 2023 payment. (GE 2 at 7; AE \nN; Tr. at 36.) She denied a delinquent automobile loan for $8,689 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) and offered \na letter from the creditor dated February 7, 2023, AE K, stating the debt had been paid in \nfull on June 30, 2020. (GE 2 at 8.) \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the costs associated with changing \njobs and moving frequently. (GE 1; Tr. at 29.) When she stopped attending school, she \nwas aware her loans would come due in six months. (Tr. at 25.) She did not begin \npayments but stated she made an inquiry with the Department of Education (DoEd). She \ndid not follow-up. (Tr. at 25-26.) Between 2015 and September of 2023 she did not have \nany communications with her loan providers until she submitted an application in October \n2023 for the Fresh Start program. She acknowledged receiving notification letters over \nthe years about the delinquent status of her student loans but never started making \npayments because she did not have sufficient income. (Tr. at 27.) She was accepted into \nthe Fresh Start program in November 2023. (Tr. at 27; AE C; AE FF.) The first delinquent \nstudent loan was assigned to collection in August 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and the last student \nloans to be assigned to collection were in May 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h). All of the \nstudent loans have a date of last activity (DLA) of December 2017. (GE 2.) She testified \nthat she was aware of her student loans but only made an occasional inquiry over the \nyears until she received the SOR. (Tr. at 25.) She testified she did not seek forbearance \non her student loans and about 30 days before the hearing she submitted an application \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto enroll her student loans in the Fresh Start program. (Tr. at 27, 28, 56-57; AE C; AE \nFF.) \nI have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the President directed the DoEd to provide the following temporary relief on \nDoEd-owned federal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on \ndefaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures through \nSeptember 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief was extended several times by \nsubsequent Executive Orders. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-\n19. Congress barred any further extensions and DoEd announced that student loan \nrepayments would resume in October 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-\nannouncement. \nApplicant maintains a budget on her phone. She makes about $3,000 from work \nand receives $731 monthly for her Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating. \nShe received her VA rating in early 2012. She has no money in savings or in a retirement \naccount. She estimated she has about $300 left over after paying her bills. (Tr. at 21-22, \n52.) She submitted her bills template showing $3,222 in bills and $3,508 income. (AE \nCC.) \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the SCA. She completed her SCA online. \n(Tr. at 41.) When she submitted her SCA, she answered \u201cno\u201d to all questions asking \nwhether she had any financial delinquencies. She stated in her Answer and testimony \nshe \u201caccidently\u201d triggered the submission. She did not inform anyone immediately \nafterwards that she had not completed all of the SCA when she submitted it. (Tr. at 43, \n62-63.) She testified when the investigator contacted her, she told him immediately of the \nissue, \u201cAs soon as he got on the phone, I let him know, sir, there was an error on my \nbehalf as far as the application e-QIP.\u201d (Tr. at 43.). She gave the investigator the \ninformation about her finances, and they went through them during the interview. (Tr. at \n45.) She testified credibly that she made a prompt and good-faith effort to correct the \nomission by informing the investigator during her interview, which she had not seen prior \nto her testimony, and the Government did not offer her interview to rebut her testimony. \n(Tr. at 43-46, 62-64.) \nApplicant offered two character letters attesting to her exceptional performance, \nattention to detail, and positive influence amongst other excellent personal qualities. (AE \nA; AE B.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's federal student loans were assigned for collection starting in 2017. A \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nApplicant\u2019s student loans may no longer be considered delinquent since March 2020 \nbecause of the COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans such as these. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nThe above listed conditions are made applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. She has a history of financial \nproblems with other miscellaneous delinquent debts, as well. All of her admitted debts \nwere only recently addressed after years of inaction. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the costs of moving and changing \njobs over the years. She acknowledged letting her student loans go because she did not \nhave sufficient income to make payments. She stated that she lost contact with several \ncreditors. \nApplicant did not initiate her payment actions on her nonstudent loan debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o and 1.p) that she admitted until after the SOR was issued. She did not avail \nherself of the Fresh Start program until after the SOR was issued. Her actions that led to \nher student loan delinquencies and the insufficiency of the evidence that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances are determinative. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.p. She submitted evidence explaining the automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.q) \nhad been paid off in 2020. AG \u00b6 20(a) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.q. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant enrolled in the Fresh Start \nprogram about 30 days before the hearing.

Her student loans \nbecame delinquent in 2017, well before the Fresh Start program went into effect. She \noffered no evidence of any difficulty in working with her creditors. Her actions and \nstatements regarding her handling of the debts alleged prior to the SOR show that she \nhas not acted responsibly under the circumstances. \u201cA person who begins to address \nconcerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy \nmay lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019, citing ISCR Case No. \n17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). \nI am unable to find that she acted responsibly under the circumstances or that she \nmade a good-faith effort to pay her student loans or the other debts until the SOR was \nissued. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her recent actions are insufficient \nto mitigate the concerns about Applicant\u2019s student loans and other debts. None of the \nother mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified the specific \nquestions alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are \nconcluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant's honorable \nmilitary service and character letters. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. This decision should not be \nconstrued as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform \nnecessary for award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards \nestablishment of a track record of paying or resolving her debts, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her eligibility for a public trust position with access \nto sensitive information. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 20, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 17, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on March 23, \n2023. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.

There \nwere no objections to any documents offered in evidence, and they are all admitted. The \ncase was assigned to me on March 27, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.d though 1.j and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c. In his response to the FORM, he changed his answer to the SOR and \nadmitted all of the allegations in it. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He attended college but did not earn a degree. He never \nmarried and has no children. He served in the Army National Guard from 2013 until his \nhonorable discharge in November 2019. He has worked for his current employer since \nOctober 2021. He disclosed on his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA) \nthat he was employed from June 2018 until September 2021, and he left the job for better \nopportunities and by mutual agreement after notice of unsatisfactory performance. He \nlisted that he was unemployed from September 2014 to June 2018 and during that time \nhe was focused on his military service. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA asked him about any past financial delinquencies, and he \nresponded \u201cno\u201d to all of the questions. In August 2022, he was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator. He was asked if he had defaulted on any loan in the past seven \nyears and he said \u201cno.\u201d He was asked if he had any delinquencies over 120 days, and he \nsaid he had two credit cards that became delinquent in 2018 after he lost his job. He could \nnot recall any of the details about the accounts. He explained that when he completed his \nSCA, he was unaware of the relevancy of his financial matters and believed the only thing \nthat would be considered was his military service. He said he rushed to complete the SCA \nand quickly answered \u201cno\u201d to all the questions. Applicant\u2019s statement that he lost his job \nin 2018 conflicts with his employment disclosure in his SCA. (Item 4) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($12,699). He agreed it was his debt for a car he purchased in March 2018. He said he \nfell behind on his payments when he was terminated from his job around 2018. He was \nstopped by the police, and he said he was told his paperwork on the car had issues. The \ncar was impounded and then repossessed. He received correspondence from the \ncreditor, and he ignored it because he felt the creditor did not give him a chance to make \nthe payments that he missed to retrieve the car from the impoundment lot. He said he \nwas not sure how he would repay the debt. (Item 4) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($9,066), 1.c ($4,208) and 1.e ($1,045) are delinquent \nstudent loans. Applicant told the investigator he began taking out student loans in 2012 \nand was unable to pay them. He planned to apply for a federal student loan forgiveness \nprogram. They are unresolved.

He was in a car accident and had an \nx-ray and rehabilitation. He said the accident was not his fault and he had insurance. He \nsaw the debt on his Credit Karma report and ignored it. (Item 4) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,030) was for cell phone service. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that the debt belonged to him. He missed monthly payments and could not \nafford to pay the bill. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant told the investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($921) did not belong to \nhim. He said he was disputing the debt with the credit bureau. (Item 4) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($622) is a charged-off credit card account. Applicant \nagreed the account belonged to him, and he fell behind in paying it in 2018. He said he \nmade some sporadic payments, but eventually was unable to pay the debt. He said he \nplanned to pay it in the future when he is able. (Item 4) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($576) is for satellite television service. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he was aware of the debt and viewed it on his Credit Karma report but \ndisagreed with it. He admitted he was required to return the creditor\u2019s equipment, and he \nprocrastinated in doing so. He said he returned it two months late and received a phone \ncall in August 2022 and was told he still owed the amount due. He said he is disputing \nthe debt. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($184) is a debt to a bank. No information was provided \nabout this debt, except that Applicant disputed it. He told the investigator that he monitors \nhis Credit Karma report and is aware of his debts but could not afford to pay them. He is \ntrying to improve his credit and once he is financially able, he will contact the creditors \nand resolve the debts. \n \nThe SOR debts are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from \nMay 2022 and December 2022. (Items 4, 5, 6; AE A) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he changed his answer to the SOR and \nadmitted he owed all the debts alleged. He stated that he now has a settlement agreement \nfor all of his debts, and he is willing to pay the debts to show good faith and that he is \nresponsible. He hopes this will be viewed favorably for him to obtain a security clearance. \n(AE A) \nApplicant provided a copy of the agreement with a debt relief company that he \nentered into on April 11, 2023. The debts enrolled in the agreement are alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. Applicant did not provide any information about the status or \nwhat he planned to do regarding the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g and 1.j. \nNo other evidence was provided.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n(b) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted he owed all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, which \ntotal approximately $32,195. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant admitted he owes all the alleged debts in the SOR. He said he could not \npay some debts after he lost his job in 2018. According to his SCA he has been employed \nsince 2018 and with his present employer since October 2021. Applicant stated he could \nnot afford to pay his debts. His debts are unresolved and therefore ongoing and recent. \nEven if his delinquent debts were beyond his control, he failed to show how he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. After receiving the FORM, he contracted with a \ndebt relief company and enrolled some of his debts in a settlement program. He failed to \naddress any action he is taking on the other delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. Perhaps \nhe received some counseling when he contracted with the debt relief company, but it is \nunknown. He did not enter into the settlement program until after he received the FORM. \nThis does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He did not \ninclude all his debts in the program and did not provide evidence regarding how he intends \nto resolve those not in the program. Applicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts \nuntil after realizing that they were an impediment to obtaining a security clearance \u201cdoes \nnot reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016.) \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. In his original answer, Applicant said he disputed \ncertain debts, but then changed his answer and admitted them all. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(e) \nis not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He successfully mitigated the \nGuideline F, financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2023, the Department of Defense issued to Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline K, handling protected \ninformation, Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 15, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 9, 2024. I contacted \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant on January 11, 2024, and confirmed the date of hearing. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 17, 2024, \nscheduling the hearing by Microsoft Teams for January 31, 2024. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. Applicant objected to GE 4, the \nsummarized results of interviews. I sustained the objection. There were no other \nobjections, and GEs 1 through 3 and 5 through 11 were admitted in evidence. Applicant \nand two witnesses testified on his behalf. He did not offer any exhibits at his hearing. I left \nthe record open until February 14, 2024, to permit him to submit documents. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted documents that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E. There was no objection, and they were admitted in evidence and the record \nclosed. DOHA received the hearing transcript on February 9, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, \n2.g, 2.i, 2.j, 3.a, and 3.b. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.h, 2.a, 2.b, 2.f, and 2.h. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old. He served in the Army National Guard from 1988 to 1998 \nand then the Army Reserve from 1998 to 2019 when he retired in the paygrade E-6. He \nwas recalled to active duty from 2005 to 2007 and served in stateside posts. He married \nin 1992 and has two grown children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2020. He has \nworked for federal contractors and other employers throughout his civilian career. He has \nheld a security clearance since approximately 2008 while working for federal contractors \nand during his military career. (Tr. 33-37; GE 1, 2, 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2022 security clearance application (SCA) he listed his job title \nas \u201cCyber Security\u201d from February 2015 to June 2020 for different employers. From \nSeptember 2013 to March 2014, he was a systems administrator. (GE 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant was employed by Company X, a federal contractor, from October 2019 \nuntil June 2020 when he was terminated. He held a security clearance while employed \nthere. On his June 2022 SCA, he disclosed the termination and stated the reason he left \nthis job was because \u201cemployment terminated didn\u2019t work out for myself.\u201d He also stated: \n\u201cBad fit didn\u2019t work out.\u201d He further disclosed that he was fired, and the reason was \n\u201cauditing was incomplete a few systems didn\u2019t get audit for the week.\u201d In response to the \nquestion on whether he received disciplinary action or a warning, he disclosed an action \noccurred in February 2020, and he said the reason for the action was because \u201ccontainer \nwas secured at the end of the day and my name was listed last[.] [I] didn\u2019t agree with the \ndecision.\u201d (GE 3) \nApplicant testified and confirmed that he was knowledgeable about the National \nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), had new employee orientation \nfrom Company X, and had received training on its policies and security protocols. \n2 \n\n \nDocuments from Company X also state that he received training on the aspects of \nCompany X\u2019s policies and procedures as it pertains to the NISPOM. It stated that he had \nreceived Information Systems (IS) training, retraining on ISs and shadowed by \nCompliance and Risk Assessor (CRA) and Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) \nMs. Y to ensure he was familiar with all IS and security protocols. The Government\u2019s \nevidence includes investigative reports for each alleged incident with the cited regulations \nfrom the NISPOM for reporting and safeguarding requirements for classified information. \nApplicant testified that he did not receive any training when he started working with \nCompany X. He later admitted he was trained for the position he was hired. (Tr. 77,179-\n185; GE 6, 7, 8, 9) \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j that Applicant committed security violations \nwhile at Company X. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his testimony, he stated that \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d are for the same incident. The Government agreed. \nHis admissions and explanations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in about January 2020, Applicant committed a security \nviolation when he failed to properly secure an unclassified laptop computer at the end of \nthe workday. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleged he committed a security violation in about January 2020 \nwhen he left his badge in an unclassified computer overnight. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.a and \nadmitted \u00b6 1.d. In his SOR answer, he said he only had a desktop computer and did not \nremember working on an unclassified laptop computer. He admitted he left his badge in \nhis desktop computer overnight. He did not remember why he failed to retrieve it but \nsurmised he was in a rush, and his actions were unintentional. He testified that when he \nreturned to work the next day, he had to retrieve the badge from security personnel who \nfound the badge the night before. The security officer made the report about the incident. \nApplicant did not report it to his supervisor. He testified that he was aware that it is against \nCompany X\u2019s rules to leave your computer unattended with a badge inserted in it. He said \nhe was aware it was a security violation, and it did not happen again. Applicant attributed \nhis conduct to lack of training by his employer. I find SOR \u00b6 1.d more accurately describes \nthe incident. (Tr. 70-77, 83-91; GE 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant committed a security violation in about January \n2020 when he failed to complete an open/close log for a secured area at the end of the \nworkday. Applicant denied this allegation. In his SOR answer and his testimony, he stated \nthat when entering a secured area, the first person in the area must make an entry in the \nlogbook. Anyone who enters the area while the first person is still in the secured area \ndoes not have to make an entry in the logbook. The only other person required to make \nan entry in the logbook is the last person to leave the secured area. If the secured area \nis unoccupied later in the day and someone enters, they must make an entry in the \nlogbook. Applicant denied this allegation because he said he was not the first person to \nenter the secured area, and he was not the last person to leave, so he was not required \nto make an entry in the logbook. He was familiar with the prescribed protocol. He said the \nCompliance and Risk Assessor (CRA) notified him that she was aware he was in the \nsecured room, but he denied he was the last to leave. He stated that she could not have \nknown who the last person was in the room. I was not provided evidence to show \n3 \n\nApplicant was the last person to enter the secured room. I was only provided a one-line \nconclusion that said \u201cFailure to complete the open/close log for a secured area\u201d in \nCompany X\u2019s General Administrative Inquiry/Security Violation report. There is \ninsufficient evidence to find Applicant committed a security violation. (Tr. 91-108; GE 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that in about January 2020, Applicant committed a security \nviolation by failing to secure a classified safe at the end of the workday. Applicant admitted \nthis allegation in his SOR answer and stated he retrieved a laptop from the classified safe \nand then returned it. Later a security guard checked the safe and found the safe door was \nopen and the combination knob had not been properly closed. Applicant said it was his \nfirst month on the job, and he may have accidentally not turned the knob enough times. \nHe said it was unintentional and due to lack of training. He testified he believed he had \nturned the knob adequately, but maybe he did not. He then testified that perhaps \nsomeone after him had used the safe and did not turn the knob. His name was in the \nlogbook as the last person to use the safe. He acknowledged that it was possible he did \nnot secure the knob. Applicant could not recall if he received written disciplinary action. \nThe next day he and coworkers were given refresher training for locking and securing \nsecurity containers. Applicant provided conflicting testimony. I find Applicant committed a \nsecurity violation. (Tr. 108-130; GE 5, 7, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged that in February 2020, Applicant brought his personal cell phone \ninto a classified area. He was placed on a performance improvement plan. Another \nemployee found the cell phone and reported it. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted \nthis allegation. He explained that he was unaware that the area outside of a secured room \nwas also considered a classified area. He testified to get into this area that is outside of \nthe secured room, he had to use a combination code to access it. He would then have to \nuse another combination code to access the secure room. He said it was the first time he \nhad accessed the area and was unfamiliar with it. The employee who found the phone \nreported the incident. Applicant did not report it to his supervisor because it had already \nbeen reported. I find this was a security violation. Applicant admitted he made a mistake. \nThe violation was reported by his coworker. Applicant said his supervisor advised him he \nwas on a performance improvement plan. He does not remember what it said. He said \nhe thought it was an initial performance review that new employees receive. (Tr. 130-152; \nGE 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that in about May 2020, Applicant committed a security violation \nby failing to secure a classified safe and failing to perform an end-of-day security check. \nA classified safe was found unsecured and open for over four hours. Applicant was the \nlast person to log opening the safe. Applicant gave the same explanation as he did for \nSOR \u00b6 1.c that someone who did not properly log in could have opened the safe after him \nand be responsible. He denied he was required to perform an end-of-day security check \nas part of his responsibilities. There is insufficient evidence regarding whether it was part \nof Applicant\u2019s work responsibilities to do an end-of-day security check. There is \nsubstantial evidence to conclude Applicant committed a security violation by failing to \nproperly secure the classified safe. He confirmed that the CRA discussed with him his \nnegligence in leaving the safe open. (Tr. 152-179-185; GE 6, 7) \n4 \n\n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that in about May 2020, Applicant committed a security violation \nwhen he left an unclassified CD/DVD in a classified system. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in his SOR answer and said it was unintentional and inadvertent. He testified \nthat he received an unclassified CD/DVD and loaded it into his computer and then forgot \nthe disk was in the computer. Later someone found it and reported it. He admitted it was \na security violation. (Tr. 185-187; GE 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged that Applicant committed a security violation by failing to secure \nan unmarked DVD containing classified information. It was determined by his employer \nto be an act of gross negligence, and he was suspended. Applicant denied this allegation \nin his SOR answer and said he remembered leaving a DVD out but it was not labeled \n\u201cunclassified\u201d and he never put classified information on it. He denied he was suspended. \nApplicant testified that he was conducting an audit on his computer and his server was \nfull. He took a blank DVD and formatted it, but said he never put it in the computer. The \ninvestigation determined that an unclassified DVD was found during an investigative audit \nand determined to be Applicant\u2019s responsibility. The DVD became classified when it was \nlabeled. Applicant could not recall labeling it but said maybe he did. It was found in a \nclassified system and determined to have been in the computer for three days prior to the \naudit. He further testified that he thought he left the disk on his desk and not in the \ncomputer drive. He admitted he was aware he should not leave a DVD in a classified \nsystem. He said he did not believe his conduct constituted gross negligence but was just \na mistake. I find there is substantial evidence to conclude Applicant committed a security \nviolation. (Tr. 187-206; GE 7, 8, 9; SOR answer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleged that in about June 2020, Applicant committed a security violation \nwhen he failed to secure a laptop that contained classified information. His employer \ndetermined his conduct to be an act of gross negligence. Applicant admitted this security \nviolation in his SOR answer. The investigation revealed that Mr. Q discovered Applicant\u2019s \nlaptop sitting on top of a cabinet in front of Mr. Q\u2019s cubicle. He opened the laptop and \ndiscovered that it was a \u201cSecret/NOFORN\u201d (not releasable to foreign national) laptop, and \nno one was around to properly secure it. He instructed Applicant to come over and \nproperly secure the laptop in the safe. Mr. Q asked Applicant why he left the laptop on \nthe cabinet unattended because it was classified and should have been in his possession. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation to Mr. Q was he usually places the laptop on top of the safe after \nhe has concluded his audit and then places it in the safe. He was at the safe with another \nemployee acting as a second person verifier on the logbook, a new practice instituted. He \nsigned the logbook. He forgot the laptop power cord and went to get it. He said while he \nwas gone, Mr. Q must have come around the corner and saw the laptop. In the \ninvestigative report, Applicant said he was only gone for a minute. He said he could see \nover the cubicle, and no one came into the area. He said another employee was in the \narea, and he asked him to keep an eye on it. The other employee told the investigator \nthat he did not hear Applicant ask him to watch the computer as he was in his cubicle and \nthere was no one else in the area. Applicant was suspended after this incident. (Tr. 206-\n222; GE 9) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt this hearing Applicant, stated he could see the laptop at all times, and he was \nno more than five feet away from it. He said he believes that his superior thought he was \ntoo far away. He said he was unaware of how far away was permissible but thought it \ncould be a hand-distance away. When asked about being \u201caround the corner\u201d he \nexplained he could see the laptop above the divider. He said he took additional training \nand realized his mistake. I find Applicant committed a security violation. (Tr. 206-222; GE \n9) \nAudits on systems and computers were part of Applicant\u2019s job. The purpose of an \naudit is to monitor computers to ensure classified information is not compromised. It is an \nautomated system that runs software that reviews what was accessed on that computer. \nThe person responsible for an audit could be required to conduct an audit on 100 \ncomputers. Before doing an audit, the computers must be backed up. If a computer is \nturned off, it cannot be backed up and an audit cannot be accomplished. Applicant had \nseveral computers that he was responsible to audit, but they had not been backed up. \nWhen he ran the audit on the computers that he was responsible for, he could not conduct \nthe audit on those that were not backed up. He was responsible to find the computers \nthat had not been audited and conduct it. He failed to audit several computers. His \nemployer terminated him in late June 2020 due to his inability to comply with company \nregulations and security procedures. Applicant admitted in his SOR answer this \nallegation. He explained that while conducting an audit of a computer he found that a disk \nwas full, and he had to move files around to create space and thought a file got saved to \na different location. He said he only missed doing the audit on one laptop. He testified \nthat there were other employees that failed to do all of their audits. (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Tr. 77-\n83, 223-227; GE 9) \nApplicant testified that he committed some security violations and denied others. \nHe admitted he made mistakes. He believed he was not properly trained by his employer. \nHe believed his supervisor was attempting to make him look bad. He said other \nemployees committed similar offenses and were not written up or terminated. He testified \nthat he has worked for other government contractors and did not have any security \nviolations. (Tr. 229) \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant was at times evasive and less than candid. He \nfrequently changed his testimony when confronted with specific facts. Although some of \nhis statements could be due to memory failure, I also believe at times his vague and \nnonresponsive statements were intentional. \nThe investigative inquiries report that Applicant received additional training after \nthe first incident of leaving a safe unsecure (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also reported the corrective \nactions taken to preclude future violations were as follows: \nRebriefing, retraining on procedures to safeguarding classified information \nvia the Learning Management System and STEPP database, security \nproviding discussion on security protocol, shadowing by ISSM [Information \nSystems Security Manager] or Compliance and Risk Assessor. (GE 8) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent debts. He testified that in 2015 \nhe was on a family reunion trip to Las Vegas. While there, he was approached by two \npeople who attempted to sell him a timeshare (SOR \u00b6 3.a - $7,123). He said he signed a \ncontract and was told he could cancel it. They also signed him up for a credit card and \nput the downpayment for the timeshare on the credit card (SOR \u00b6 3.b - $1,674). He denied \nthat he signed up for this credit card and said he has never used it. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he was told he could cancel the agreement within a couple of days, and he \nrepeatedly attempted to do so within the time period but no one would answer the phone \nat the number he was provided. He never used the timeshare and never made payments. \nHe said he has tried for years to resolve these debts. (Tr. 37-59; AE A-E) \nIn 2023, Applicant was contacted by two men about the timeshare. They invited \nhim to dinner and told him that he could resolve the debt for the timeshare by taking out \ntwo credit cards and splitting the balance owed on each card. Applicant credibly testified \nthat he was trying to take care of this debt that was on his credit report. He agreed to take \nout the two credit cards, which were supposed to resolve the timeshare debt, but they did \nnot. He said each card was charged $3,000. He has been paying the amounts due on \nthese credit cards. They are not alleged as being delinquent. Applicant disputed the debts \non his credit report. His most recent credit report from January 2024 does not report the \ndebts. He does not know if the two credit cards were actually used to pay the timeshare \ndebt. He has no other delinquent debts. Post-hearing, he provided documents to show \nhis efforts to dispute and resolve these debts. (Tr. 37-69; GE 11; AE A through E) \nA former coworker and friend testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The coworker \ndescribed Applicant as a person of integrity who always did the right thing. If he made a \nmistake, it was unintentional. He believed the employer was inconsistent in their warnings \nto employees for security violations. Some received verbal warnings for things that others, \nincluding Applicant, were written up for. His brother-on-law testified for him. He also \nserved with him in the military. He believes Applicant did a great job while a soldier. They \nwent to church together and Applicant is a man of character and is truthful. Applicant \nprovided a narrative in his SOR answer. He said he is a family man and a trustee at his \nchurch. He volunteers at a facility for foster children. He was a youth coach for over ten \nyears. He has never been arrested. (Tr. 238-254; SOR answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive\ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability\nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nThere is substantial evidence1 from Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, along \nwith documents, that support he failed to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor sensitive information and was lax or negligent in his security practices when he failed \nto secure a classified safe, left his badge in an unclassified computer overnight, took his \ncell phone into a classified area, left an unclassified CD/DVD in a classified system, failed \nto secure an unmarked DVD containing classified information, failed to properly secure a \nclassified laptop computer, and failed to complete audits of systems as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c through 1.j). Despite being trained and counseled by his employer the incidents \npersisted. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate handling protected information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities ; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or \nrevoking access to classified information, as they raise serious questions about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Once it is established that an \napplicant has committed a security violation, he or she has a very heavy burden of \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994); ISCR Case \nNo. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006). \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrating that he or she should be entrusted with classified information. Because \nsecurity violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an \nadministrative judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny. In \nmany security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an indicator \nof a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts, \nor drug use). Security violation cases reveal more than simply an indicator of risk. See \nISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006). \nI am cognizant of the heavy burden under this guideline. However, we are all \nhuman beings and mistakes will happen, even by the most careful of individuals. \nApplicant disclosed that he has worked in cyber security for several years. He was familiar \nwith his duty to comply with the NISPOM and his employer\u2019s rules and regulations. He \nreceived training when he began his job. Some of security incidents did not require special \ntraining, such as ensuring the safe was locked and spinning the knob, ensuring you do \nnot leave your badge in your computer overnight, leaving a DVD in a classified system \nand failing to secure a classified laptop. Other security violations may be unique to the \nemployer, such as what area is considered a secured area where cell phones are \nprohibited. All of these are security incidents or violations that Applicant committed and \ndemonstrate a pattern. I am unable to find his conduct was infrequent or happened under \nunusual circumstances and are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 35(g) does not apply. \nApplicant took some responsibility for his conduct, but also deflected it and offered \nalternative explanations for why he was not responsible. He cited his lack of training to \nbe the reason for some of the security incidents, but also noted that he has held a security \nclearance for many years, was familiar with the NISPOM and had received training when \nhe was hired. In addition, his years working as a cyber security analyst would indicate \nthat he was aware or should have been aware of his duties to ensure a safe is properly \nclosed, a badge is retrieved from your computer before leaving for the night, and classified \nlaptops are not left unattended. The pattern of security violations indicates he failed to \ndemonstrate a positive attitude toward the discharge of his security responsibilities. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 35(b) and 35(c) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s security violations were due to negligence. It appears that they were \nreported by other employees. The investigative reports indicate there was no compromise \nof classified information. However, there was clearly a pattern of security violations that \ncannot be overlook. AG \u00b6 35(d) does not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s eight security incidents (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c though 1.j) as alleged under \nGuideline K, were cross-alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.a) under the personal conduct guideline. His \nconduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 \n16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the handling protected information \nguideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was serious. He has not fully acknowledged his responsibility \nfor his conduct, which raises concerns that he is not truly rehabilitated. I cannot find that \nfuture questionable conduct is unlikely to recur. His conduct continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions, individually or collectively, are sufficiently applicable to overcome Applicant\u2019s \nconduct. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has two delinquent debts associated with a timeshare he purchased in \n2015. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant credibly testified that in 2015 he was the victim of predatory timeshare \nvendors who sold him property, required him to secure a credit card to pay the down \npayment and advised him he could cancel the contract within a couple of days. He \nattempted to cancel it within the time period and could not reach the company because \nthey would not respond to his attempts. He then was approached about taking out two \nnew credit cards to pay for the timeshare. Wanting to resolve the debts, he complied with \nthe plan. He is making payments on those credit cards. For years he has been attempting \nto resolve the debts associated with the timeshare and credit card. He produced sufficient \ndocumentary evidence to show his efforts. The debts are no longer on his most recent \ncredit report. I find he has acted responsibly, attempted to resolve the debts, and has a \nreasonable dispute. I find all of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines K, E, and F in whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Applicant has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline K, \nhandling protected information and Guideline E, personal conduct. He successfully \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant (except failing to \nperform end-of-day security checks) \nSubparagraphs: 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He graduated high school in 1996. He married in 2003, \nand has three children, two of which are minors. He has worked as project manager for \nhis current employer since September 2020. He served on active duty in the Army from \n1996 to 2017, when he retired from service. He had multiple deployments to combat \nzones during his time of service. (Answer; Item 3) \nIn August 2019, Applicant had surgery, followed by seizures, and he was unable \nto work. He was unemployed for a total 15 months. He stated that he only received one \nmonth of short-term disability, and then he was terminated by his employer. (Answer; \nItems 3, 4; AE A) \nThe 15-month period of unemployment put a strain on Applicant\u2019s finances. His \nwife does not work, and he is the sole income earner of their family. He reported that he \nwas able to use his military retirement and disability earnings to sustain their basic living \nexpenses, but he fell behind on his other expenses.

The status of the debts \nis as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off for $30,124. Applicant stated that \nhis car was totaled during a medical emergency, and his auto-insurance rejected the \nclaim because he had a lapse in payments on his policy. He claimed to have had contact \nwith the creditor, and intends to pay, but this account is not resolved. (Answer; Items 3, \n4, 5; AE A)    \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an auto loan that was charged off for $24,452.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit report in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the SOR debts, other than SOR \u00b6 1.d, are resolved or being paid. He \nrecently paid \u00b6 1.d after the record reopened, which was delinquent even after he became \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreemployed in 2020.

His failure to pay his delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, \nand not isolated. His failure to meet his financial obligations continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. While his health issues and resulting unemployment \nwere beyond his control, he failed to provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has not submitted sufficient documentation \nshowing that he has received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, \nor that there are not clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) only applies to SOR \u00b6 1.d, which is now paid. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient documentation of payment arrangements, a record of debt payments, or \nresolution of any of the remaining SOR debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation that \nhe had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of the debts alleged, or that \nsubstantiates the basis for the dispute, or evidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn his 2022 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nasked to provide documentation regarding his financial delinquencies after the interview, \nwhich he did not submit. He did not provide documentation along with his Answer to the \nSOR, and he did not provide a response after receiving the FORM. When the record \nreopened in this case, he was offered the opportunity to \u201csubmit documentation that \nshows that you paid off or are paying any of the debts alleged, and the current balance \nof the debts\u2026\u201d In response, he only provided a short narrative and one receipt regarding \none of the eight accounts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his honorable military service. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of his delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After completing his military service, he began pursing higher education. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2011, and a master\u2019s degree in November \n2013. He financed his education with the federal student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.u. (Tr. 18-24, 31, 40-42; GE 1; Ans Ex.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed two \ndelinquent consumer accounts, totaling $8,101 and 19 federal student loans, totaling \n$127,098.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following financial considerations disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) an inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt in the years following his mother\u2019s December \n2015 death, an event beyond his control. In his grief, he did not pay attention to his \nfinances. Given the length of time he left his finances unattended, his actions to resolve \nhis delinquent account cannot be considered as acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. As a result, AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. However, his actions merit the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith-effort to \nrepay his creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d After receiving the SOR, he has made a \ngood-faith effort to repay his creditors. He resolved the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b in January 2023. He has also taken advantage of the Fresh Start Program to \nrehabilitate his delinquent student loans. His actions are sufficient mitigate the financial \nconcerns alleged in the SOR. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered the whole-person \nfactors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d Furthermore, applicants are not held to a standard of \nperfection. Applicant experienced emotional difficulties in the aftermath of his mother\u2019s \ndeath. Grief is not linear. An individual cannot control their grief response or how long its \neffect may linger. Applicant responded appropriately to SOR and addressed the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns. He is otherwise financially healthy and there are no other \nsecurity concerns related to his finances. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.u:  \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency between 2006 \nand April 2022. In April 2019, he tested positive for THC after urinalysis testing. The \nabove listed disqualifying conditions are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has used marijuana for over 15 years. The amount of time that he \ncould have been abstinent (since April 2022) is insignificant in comparison. He \ncontinued to use marijuana after twice being convicted of marijuana possession and \nlosing a job because of it. He also used it after completing the SF 86. Given these \nconsiderations, he has provided insufficient evidence that his marijuana involvement is \nunlikely to recur. While he has acknowledged his drug involvement, he has not provided \nevidence showing his action to overcome his problem. He failed to provide sufficient \nevidence that his marijuana involvement and the circumstances surrounding it do not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the \nGuideline H mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official. \nApplicant deliberately omitted his illegal drug involvement and employment \ntermination on his SF 86. In June 2022, he also deliberately lied to a DOD authorized \ninvestigator about his employment termination. Both of the above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant did not correct his omission or concealment of his employment \ntermination prior to being confronted by the DOD investigator with the truth. He \ncorrected his concealment of his marijuana involvement after having been confronted \nabout his employment termination because the true nature of his termination involved \nhis marijuana use. Given these circumstances, I find that his efforts to correct the \nconcealment of his marijuana involvement were not prompt or made in good faith. AG \u00b6 \n17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately omitting required information and lying to DOD investigators is not \nminor. Instead, these actions strike at the heart of the security clearance process, which \nrelies on candid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in this deceitful and \nmisleading activity with respect to two separate aspects of his background. Therefore, \nhe has not shown that the offense is minor, his behavior was infrequent, it happened \nunder unique circumstances, or it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant ultimately acknowledged his intentionally dishonest behavior, he \nhas provided no evidence of counseling or other steps he has taken to alleviate this \nbehavior. Moreover, for the reasons I provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I cannot \nfind his behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse or personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The record was held open until July 28, 2023, and extended \nto September 15, 2023, to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional post-\nhearing evidence. I subsequently reopened the record on February 6, 2024, to review \nApplicant\u2019s recent credit report. After reviewing the transcript and evidence, I proposed \nto the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. Both parties had ten days to consider the matter and to provide written notice of \ntheir objections. Neither party objected. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old transcriptionist employed by a defense contractor since \nApril 2019 and assigned to a military hospital. She is a single mother with two \ndaughters, ages 27 and 17. Her annual salary is approximately \u201c$31,000 to $32,000.\u201d \nThis case centers on the significant debt that Applicant incurred after she lost a previous \njob when her then employer went out of business in April 2019. She was unemployed \nfrom May 2019 to November 2019. She was briefly employed from November 2019 to \nApril 2020 until she was laid off as a result of the COVID epidemic. In 2021 her father \npassed away, and in 2022 her sister passed away. Applicant incurred unplanned \nexpenses to help defray funeral expenses for her father and sister. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts totaling $26,920. Realizing her debt \nhad become unmanageable, Applicant sought the advice of a bankruptcy attorney. She \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on May 8, 2023. Before filing, she completed the \nmandatory financial counseling. Her budget reflects that she leads a modest lifestyle \nand lives within her means. At the time of her hearing on May 25, 2023, she was \nawaiting Chapter 7 discharge. She received her discharge on August 15, 2023, and \ntimely submitted proof of her discharge while the record was open. A review of \nApplicant\u2019s February 6, 2024 credit report indicates that she has not incurred any \ndelinquent debt since her discharge and her accounts are in good standing. Applicant\u2019s \nreference letters document her excellent work record, good character, trustworthiness, \nand willingness to help other at work and in her community. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel \npresented sufficient evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nF. I also conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts proven by Department Counsel. In particular, I conclude that the \nsecurity concerns are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).  \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence \nor vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her national security eligibility for a public \ntrust position. This case is decided for Applicant. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n3 \n",

He was previously granted access to classified information in connection with his service in the U.S. Navy from April 1991 to May 2015. On December 18, 2020, the Continuous Evaluation Program (CEP) developed information from a December 17, 2020, credit report that he had ten delinquent accounts, totaling $22,084. He completed a security clearance application, dated January 5, 2022. He disclosed his failure to pay federal income taxes assessed by the IRS in 2018 after correcting Applicant\u2019s 2018 federal income tax return. He did not disclose any other derogatory financial information. The investigation revealed that Applicant received Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in July 2016 and that he owed $21,437 on seven delinquent accounts.

This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to grant his security clearance.

He was previously granted access to classified information in connection with \nhis service in the U.S. Navy from April 1991 to May 2015. On December 18, 2020, the \nContinuous Evaluation Program (CEP) developed information from a December 17, \n2020, credit report that he had ten delinquent accounts, totaling $22,084. He completed \na security clearance application, dated January 5, 2022. He disclosed his failure to pay \nfederal income taxes assessed by the IRS in 2018 after correcting Applicant\u2019s 2018 \nfederal income tax return. He did not disclose any other derogatory financial \ninformation. The investigation revealed that Applicant received Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection in July 2016 and that he owed $21,437 on seven delinquent accounts. The \nbankruptcy and the delinquent accounts are alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 29; GE 1, 6-8; AE \nD,E) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began while he was on active duty. Since at least \n2004, Applicant has maintained State 1 as his primary residence. He received orders for \nan assignment in State 2. The couple attempted to maintain residences in State 1 and \nState 2. He and his wife decided to keep their primary residence and rent a home in \nState 2. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2011. The record \ndoes not contain information about the amount of debt included in the petition or the \namount of the plan payments. The petition was discharged in July 2016.

He testified that he never got a good handle on his finances and \nbegan to accumulate debt again. He admits to accumulating the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.h. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.b is for the deficiency balance on a \nvoluntary car repossession. The debt originated with the financing company. A \ncollection agency purchased the debt. This transaction is reported on as paid charged \noff or transfer to another creditor. Applicant admits that he has not made any payments \ntoward this account. The accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e are for credit \ncards. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is owed to an auto insurance company. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are debts owed to a telecommunications company. (Tr. \n37, 43-48, 50-53, 74-75; GE 9) \nAfter he received the SOR in December 2022, he decided to hire a credit repair \ncompany, which he paid between $600 and $900 to help him clean up his credit report.  \nThe company contacted Applicant\u2019s creditors and disputed the delinquent accounts \nunder the Fair Credit Reporting Act. As of December 2022, none of the alleged \naccounts were over seven years old. Applicant believes that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.e, and 1.g \nwere resolved through the dispute process without Applicant having to make any \npayments to the creditors. However, he does not have any documentation from the \ncredit repair service or the creditors to corroborate his claim that the disputes were \nresolved in his favor, such as an IRS FORM 1099-C indicating that the creditor \ncancelled the debt, or that they were not legitimate debts. He believed that he remained \nresponsible for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h. (Tr. 38-40,46,54-56, 64-65,77-\n80,82) \nA November 20, 2023, credit report, admitted to the record as GE 9, showed that \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are current and ongoing. GE 9 reported the was late on his \ntwo car loans. He admitted that he had gotten behind on the car payments because he \nprioritized sports fees for his children. \nApplicant has over $3,000 in disposable household income. He admitted that he \nhas not used any of it to pay his delinquent accounts. Applicant also testified he \nexpected to see an increase in income because his service-related disability rating \nincreased to 80%. He testified that he planned to use the extra disposable income to \npay SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h. He did not provide any proof of payment. After the hearing, \nApplicant provided evidence that he resolved two non-SOR debts, including paying off \nthe $4,000 balance on one of his past-due car loans. He testified that he would take \nfinancial management classes to help understand his finances better. (Tr. 57-62, 81; AE \nA-C) \nApplicant had two witnesses testify on his behalf at the hearing. Both know \nApplicant in his professional capacity. Both spoke highly of his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Both recommend him for continued access to classified information. \n(Tr. 17-29) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$21,437 on seven delinquent debts. The following financial considerations disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of his ability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that necessitated his filing for bankruptcy protection. In the aftermath of the \npetition\u2019s discharge, his finances did not improve. He did not rehabilitate his financial \nhabits and began to accumulate debt again. However, Applicant\u2019s recent accumulation \nof debt is not a result of his inability to pay his financial obligations, but financial \ndisorganization. Despite being on notice since at least December 2020 about the \nGovernment\u2019s concern about his finances, he did not take any significant action toward \nresolving the delinquent debt until after he received the SOR in December 2022. He did \nnot provide any evidence of his contract with the credit-repair service or evidence of \ntheir work on his behalf. He also did not provide evidence of his debt payments. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a \nstandard of perfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his \ndelinquent accounts and executing that plan. He did not present evidence of his plans \nor efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d, with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old network systems administrator employed by a federal contractor since May 2022. He has never married and has no children. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2015. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was employed by a commercial bank from August to December 2014 and was terminated for repeated tardiness. He testified that he was a full-time college student during this period, and that he was often late for work because he was tired due to the demands of school and his job. (Tr. 37, 73) Applicant was employed as a part-time leasing agent for a rental agency from August 2013 to May 2015. He worked for five hours each Saturday and Sunday. His job was to call potential clients, complete leasing applications that were not completed by the full-time employees, and respond to maintenance requests. (Tr. 34) He was terminated for not following the procedures for completing resident surveys. He testified that he was required to obtain input from residents and record it on a survey form. However, because he had \u201cbuilt relationships\u201d with some of the residents, he knew their concerns and he filled out the surveys for them. He believed that his way of conducting the surveys was more efficient than the prescribed procedure. (Tr.",

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 3, 2023, and \nthe case was assigned to me on February 1, 2024. On February 8, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted on March 6, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nbut did not submit the testimony of any other witnesses. He submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through I with his answer to the SOR, and they were admitted without objection. \nHe submitted AX J through M at the hearing, and they also were admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until March 17, 2024, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence, but he did not submit any additional evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on March 15, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.b, \n2.c, and 2.d, with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old network systems administrator employed by a federal \ncontractor since May 2022. He has never married and has no children. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in December 2015. He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant was employed by a commercial bank from August to December 2014 \nand was terminated for repeated tardiness. He testified that he was a full-time college \nstudent during this period, and that he was often late for work because he was tired due \nto the demands of school and his job. (Tr. 37, 73) \nApplicant was employed as a part-time leasing agent for a rental agency from \nAugust 2013 to May 2015. He worked for five hours each Saturday and Sunday. His job \nwas to call potential clients, complete leasing applications that were not completed by the \nfull-time employees, and respond to maintenance requests. (Tr. 34) He was terminated \nfor not following the procedures for completing resident surveys. He testified that he was \nrequired to obtain input from residents and record it on a survey form. However, because \nhe had \u201cbuilt relationships\u201d with some of the residents, he knew their concerns and he \nfilled out the surveys for them. He believed that his way of conducting the surveys was \nmore efficient than the prescribed procedure. (Tr. 70-71) He testified that he believed he \nwas terminated because of gender discrimination, because he was the only male in the \noffice and was required to perform maintenance work that his female coworkers could not \ndo, in addition to his duties as a leasing agent. (Tr. 72) \nApplicant was employed at a call center for three credit unions from July 2015 to \nApril 2017. He was fired for not meeting company goals and objectives. The company \ngoal was to take 100 help calls per day, but he took only 70 to 80 calls because he \nbelieved more time was needed with some individual callers, and he could make his quota \nof calls only by being more abrupt than he thought was appropriate.

He worked as a contract \nspecialist for a non-federal consulting company from November 2017 to November 2019. \nHe worked as an IT specialist at a help desk for a state-run medical system from \nNovember 2019 to January 2020. While working for the state-run medical system, he \ncompleted professional courses to qualify as a system administrator. (Tr. 20-21) He \nworked as a system administrator for a federal contractor from January 2020 to August \n2021. His project manager described him as a reliable and dedicated employee, with a \nreputation for helping users resolve technical difficulties with care and respect. He was \noften commended for his personalized and thoughtful approach to sharing his knowledge \nand helping users resolve difficulties. (AX E) \nApplicant worked as a system administrator for a non-federal employer from \nAugust 2021 until May 2022, when he was hired by his current employer. His current \nemployer rated him as a \u201csolid contributor\u201d on a five-category scale for the partial year \nfrom May to December 2022. \u201cExtraordinary contributor\u201d is the highest rating, followed by \n\u201cmajor contributor,\u201d \u201csolid contributor\u201d, \u201cminor contributor,\u201d and \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d (AX G) \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance review from the same employer for 2023 rated him \nas a \u201csolid contributor,\u201d His rater commented that he needed improvement in four \ncategories: (1) Follow directions as given without deviating; (2) Use an in-house tool to \ndocument work with good notes; (3) Arrive on time to work and meetings; and (4) Better \nretain information and develop technical skills. Two coworkers submitted letters attesting \nto his technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, honesty, and sincerity. (AX L) \nBetween August 2015 and June 2018, Applicant gave \u201ca good friend,\u201d access to \nhis PayPal account. He testified that the \u201cgood friend\u201d asked him for access to his PayPal \naccount so that he could transfer funds to his girlfriend. On cross-examination, Applicant \nadmitted that he did not know his \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d last name and did not know where he lived. \n(Tr. 44-45) He also admitted that he removed his own credit card account from PayPal to \nprevent his \u201cfriend\u201d from using his credit card for transactions. (Tr. 52) His \u201cfriend\u201d gave \nhim about $150-$200 in exchange for his account information. His \u201cfriend\u201d and his \n\u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d girlfriend used his account to steal money from credit-card and debit-card \naccounts of other PayPal users. \nApplicant was notified by PayPal in June 2018 that someone was using his account \nwithout his knowledge. (AX D) When he learned that his \u201cfriend\u201d had changed his \npassword, he contacted PayPal, reinstated his password, and learned about the illegal \nactivities. His \u201cfriend\u201d stole between $4,000 and $5,000 from other PayPal users. \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother was one of the victims of the PayPal fraud, losing about \n$1,000. (Tr. 28, 61) Applicant did not notify law enforcement authorities about the \ncompromise of his PayPal account. (Tr. 65) PayPal has not attempted to recoup any \nfunds from Applicant. Applicant was not charged with any criminal conduct. He disclosed \nthe PayPal fraud in his SCA. (GX 2; Tr. 29-30) \nIn May 2018, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In his petition, he \nreported monthly income of $2,625 and expenses of $2,618.

(Tr. 40-41) In addition to several \nstudent loans, his debts were a car loan of $15,770, and credit cards and collection \naccounts totaling $10,021. One of the debts was for a bank overdraft of $1,212. When he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in June 2022, he explained that he was the \nvictim of a scam in which he was asked to cash a check and send the scammer the \nproceeds. The check was fraudulent, and Applicant\u2019s checking account was overdrawn \nto cover it. (GX 3 at 16) He did not report the scam to law enforcement authorities.  \nApplicant completed the debtor education course required by the bankruptcy court \nin July 2018. (AX A) He received a discharge in August 2018. (GX 4; AX B) He testified \nthat he decided to file a petition for bankruptcy after a creditor threatened to garnish his \nwages. At the time, he was supporting his mother, a younger brother, and a younger \nsister. He consulted with a lawyer, who advised that bankruptcy was his best option. It \ntook him about a year to save up enough money to hire the lawyer. All his debts except \nfor the student loans were discharged. (Tr. 16-19) \nApplicant\u2019s current annual pay is about $100,000 per year. In addition, he works \nabout 20 hours per week for a graphics company and earns $40 per hour. (Tr. 75-76) A \ncredit report dated March 21, 2023, reflected that he was current on all debt payments. \n(GX 5) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in about \nMay 2018 and received a discharge in about August 2018. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that \nApplicant allowed two acquaintances to use his personal PayPal account to fraudulently \nsteal money from other people\u2019s credit and debit card accounts. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .

There is no evidence that Applicant was directly \ninvolved in the theft from credit-card holders through PayPal. However, he allowed \nanother person to bypass the PayPal security system by giving his credentials to that \nperson. He was suspicious of that person\u2019s request for Applicant\u2019s credentials, to the \nextent that he closed his own credit-card account so that the other person could not have \naccess to it. However, the evidence falls short of showing that he was an accomplice in \nthe PayPal fraud. His poor judgment in allowing another to have access to his account is \nmore appropriately addressed in the discussion of Guideline E below. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. The bankruptcy discharge was almost six years ago. \nApplicant is now financially stable and has a steady and substantial income. A recent \ncredit report reflects that he is current on all his financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were \nmajor factors in his inability to pay his debts. However, his periods of unemployment were \nnot largely beyond his control, but rather due to his failures to follow the rules established \nby his employers. His most recent performance evaluation reflects that he continues to \ndeviate from established procedures and continues to have problems with tardiness. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant completed the financial counseling required \nby the bankruptcy court, and his financial situation is under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge is not a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.b (the PayPal fraud) under this \nguideline. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e allege three instances in which Applicant was \nterminated from employment. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying condition under this guideline is established by the \nevidence: \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s na\u00efve facilitation of the \nPayPal fraud demonstrated a serious lack of good judgment. He did not learn from this \nexperience. Instead, he fell for another scam and incurred a substantial debt when he \ndeposited a worthless check in his bank account. His multiple periods of unemployment \nwere due to his unwillingness to follow rules. His most recent performance appraisal for \n2023 reflects that he continues to demonstrate a pattern of tardiness and failure to follow \nprocedures. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and \nremorseful at the hearing, but he tended to make excuses for his conduct. His candor \nabout the PayPal scheme was questionable when he first described the perpetrator of the \nscam as a \u201cgood friend,\u201d but he then admitted that he did not know his \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d last name \nor where he lived. He also admitted that he protected himself from this \u201cfriend\u201d by \nremoving his personal credit card from PayPal. His gullibility in facilitating the PayPal \nscheme, unwitting participation in a fraudulent check scheme, and his spotty employment \nrecord leave me with serious concerns about his judgment and his willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd.

The record \nwas kept open until April 8, 2024, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence. He \ntimely submitted exhibits (AE) A-D, which were admitted without objections. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 18, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has been in \nhis current position for approximately two years. Overall, he has been in the medical \nfield almost 20 years. He enlisted in the Army in 2005 and served until 2012, when he \nreceived an honorable discharge. He was a medical technician in the Army. He \ndeployed from 2009 to 2010 to Iraq. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married and \nhas three children, ages 17, 15, and 9. His wife also works in the medical field. (Tr. 24-\n28; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent debts. The first is based \nupon a mortgage account with a past-due balance of approximately $32,900, which \nlater went into foreclosure status with a total loan balance of approximately $171,000. \nThe second debt is a charged-off account for approximately $27,900. Applicant \nadmitted both debts in his SOR answer, and his May 2021 personal subject interview \nconducted by a background investigator. Credit reports also establish these two debts. \n(SOR answer, GE 3-7) \nApplicant admitted that in approximately 2007, he cosigned on two loans with his \nbrother-in-law (BL), so BL could purchase a home. He believed the purchase price was \naround $190,000. He confirmed that both SOR debts arose out of the same underlying \nhome purchase transaction. BL could not qualify for a loan on his own. While he is not \nparticularly close with BL, he felt obligated to do so because his wife asked him to do \nso, and because of his cultural heritage, which creates an expectation to help relatives. \nApplicant was still on active duty in the Army at this time. He was also young and \nunsophisticated in these types of financial transactions. An example of this, was that \nApplicant believed he would only be liable for 50 percent of the debt in the event BL \ncould not pay it. He told BL that he would cosign on the loans, but he expected BL to \nmake all the payments, because he was in no position to do so. BL agreed to this. (Tr. \n30-34; 48, 50) \nThe home purchased was located in a different state from where Applicant lived. \nApplicant never resided in the home, only BL and his family lived there. When Applicant \nwas deployed in 2009-2010, he was notified by the original mortgage-loan lender that \nBL had missed some payments. Applicant or his wife contacted BL about the missed \npayments and BL said he would take care of them. Apparently that happened because \nApplicant heard nothing further from this lender.

He answered affirmatively. Concerned about this \ncontact, Applicant\u2019s wife contacted BL to see what was happening. BL told his sister \nthat his wife was handling the matter. A few weeks later, Applicant was served with \nlegal process for a foreclosure action. Applicant received no warning from BL before \nbeing served that he was behind on his mortgage payments. Applicant believes the \ndelinquent amount was approximately $10,000. BL has never apologized for putting \nApplicant and his wife in this bad situation. (Tr. 52-56, 58) \nApplicant did not receive any correspondence from the lender about the \ndelinquent mortgage payments before he was served with process. BL did not attend \nthe foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure was ordered and the property sold. The \nactual date of the foreclosure is not in the record, but Applicant\u2019s most recent credit \nreport indicated a last payment date of January 2019. Applicant provided documentation \nshowing that a sale of the property took place in December 2019, with a sale price of \n$249,000, which exceeded the loan amount of $171,481. From this documentation, it \nappears SOR \u00b6 1.a was resolved. (Tr. 37-38, 68; GE 6; AE B) \nApplicant also provided a copy of a 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt form received \nfrom a mortgage lender in the amount of $9,467, which he claimed as income on his tax \nyear 2023 federal tax return, as required. He believes this 1099-C is for the mortgage \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 43-44; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound. He owns his own home and is current on \nthat mortgage loan that he incurred in 2012. His cars are paid. He is current on his \nstudent loans. His current credit report shows no delinquencies, except for the SOR \ndebt and a debt for which his wife is responsible and he is only an authorized user. He \nprovided his pay statement from his employer showing a net monthly income of \napproximately $5,600. His wife\u2019s net income is approximately $2,300. His monthly \nexpenses total approximately $4,600, leaving a monthly remainder of $3,300. He has \nnot cosigned for anyone else since this incident. (Tr. 59-60, 64; GE 2 (September 20, \n2021 personal financial statement); AE C-D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant agreed to cosign with BL on two mortgage loans that BL failed to pay \nand resulted in delinquency and ultimately foreclosure. I find the above disqualifying \ncondition is raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially applies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \nThis is a case where the cynical axiom, \u201cno good deed goes unpunished\u201d proved \nto be true. Applicant helped BL out by cosigning on two mortgage loans so BL could \npurchase a house. He did this because his wife asked him to do so and because he felt \na cultural obligation to do so. While several years went by with BL making the \npayments, at some point between 2014 and 2019, he stopped making the payments. \nHe did not inform Applicant about the trouble he was experiencing and Applicant did not \nfind out about the foreclosure until he was served with court papers. The property was \nforeclosed and sold in 2019 for more than the mortgage amount. Applicant received a \n1099-C for the second mortgage, which he claimed on this year\u2019s tax return. Otherwise, \nApplicant\u2019s financial record is very good. This was a one-time poor decision based upon \nfamily and cultural loyalty, which is admirable, but not necessarily the wisest choice. \nHowever, I believe Applicant learned a hard lesson from this experience and his \notherwise good financial history supports that this is unlikely to recur. Overall, his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment are in good standing. AG \u00b6 20(a) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a sensitive position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information.

(Tr. 17-18, 21-28; Answer; GE 1, \n2, 4) \nAfter his 2004 DWI arrest, Applicant contacted the DMV in State A to determine \nthe requirements to have the restrictions removed from his driver\u2019s license. His \nunderstanding of the information that the DMV provided him was that he had to pay \nfees. After he paid those fees, he thought he was permitted to drive. However, in 2005, \npolice pulled him over for driving with an invalid license. He had only removed two of the \nthree suspensions that had been placed on his driver\u2019s license. As a result, he spent a \nday in jail and had his period of community service extended. However, he soon \nthereafter completed all the requirements of the sentence from his 2004 DUI and was \nable to have his driver\u2019s license fully reinstated. (Tr. 25-28; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4) \nFrom 2005 until April 2021, Applicant did not engage in any disqualifying conduct \nwith alcohol, nor did he engage in criminal conduct. However, in April 2021, he was \narrested in State A and charged with DWI, second offense, after he was involved in a \nminor, single-vehicle accident. He had five beers at a golf driving range and decided to \ntry to drive home despite having had too much to drink. While testifying, he clarified \nwithout being asked that the beers he drank were not normal size beers but were \u201clarge\u201d \nbeers. While driving, he took his eyes off the road to check driving directions on his \nphone, hit a curb, and hit his head against the steering wheel, dazing himself. Police \narrived at the scene and took him to the hospital where he consented to a blood draw. \nHe does not recall his BAC percentage, but knows it was over the .08 legal limit. After \ntreatment at the hospital, he spent a night in jail.

(Tr. 35-37, 47-48; Answer; GE 1-3; AE A) \nApplicant suffered significant childhood trauma. In early 2021, when his own son \nreached the age where Applicant began suffering said trauma, he began to experience \nrenewed mental anguish from it. He did not know how to deal with his feelings and \ninternalized them. He and his wife began having marital problems, and he engaged in \nthe conduct that resulted in his April 2021 arrest during this time. He claimed that this \narrest was a wakeup call to get help for himself and his marriage. In May 2021, he \nbegan psychotherapy that he has continued up to the date of the hearing. His counselor \nholds a master\u2019s degree in counseling education and is a licensed professional \ncounselor. She opined that he has been learning healthy coping skills and has been \nreceptive and cooperative during the therapy process. She does not believe that he has \na substance-use disorder. Applicant plans to continue with this treatment. (Tr. 18-19, \n29-39, 43-47; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nAfter his 2021 arrest, Applicant and his wife have attended marital counseling \nand his marriage is in a much better place. Prior to his arrest, he had not shared his \nchildhood trauma with his wife, but he has since. He has discussed it with her and with \nhis family. He feels much better after attending psychotherapy and has learned better \ncoping mechanisms. He also attends church-organized group self-improvement \nsessions for his betterment three times per week. While he has not been diagnosed with \na substance-use disorder, he has abstained from alcohol since the day of his April 2021 \narrest. He plans to continue his abstinence. He claims that he does not need alcohol to \nenjoy himself and it has only brought him trouble.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DWI in 2004 and 2021, after drinking \ntoo much and deciding to drive. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions are \nestablished and the burden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nWhile Applicant showed poor judgment by drinking to the point of intoxication \nand driving on two occasions, he also has provided sufficient evidence that he has \nlearned from his mistakes. He was contrite and remorseful for his actions and backed \nthose sentiments up with action. While he has not been diagnosed with a substance-\nuse disorder, he has not consumed alcohol since his DWI in April 2021. He credibly \ntestified that he does not plan to drink alcohol again. He has sought and is attending \ntreatment from a qualified professional for the significant childhood trauma from which \nhe suffered that contributed to his alcohol consumption. He is undergoing marital \ncounseling to better cope with these issues. He complied with all the terms of his \nsentencing for his DWIs, including completing a 32-hour alcohol repeat-offender \nprogram and a Mother\u2019s Against Drunk Driving (MADD) victim-impact panel. He also \nhas attended self-improvement groups several nights per week at his church. His two \nDWIs no longer cause me to question his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character-reference evidence.

Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated, \nforeign terrorist organizations such as Hizballah and ISIS train and operate in Lebanon, and \nhave a particularly strong presence in southern Lebanon and south Beirut.

(HE V at 31-33) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating c onditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These gui\n \ndelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances considering the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nUnder this concern, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Moreover, foreign interests and security concerns \u201cmay also \nbe a national security concern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion \nby any foreign interest.\u201d (Id.) \nGiven Poland\u2019s status as one of the United States\u2019 strongest partners in the world in \nfostering security, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s Polish citizenship and residence \ndoes not generate a heightened security risk. There are no security risks and I resolve SOR \nsubparagraph 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAlthough Lebanon is a parliamentary republic, terrorist groups wield an inordinate \namount of influence and virtually control entire regions of the country. Under these \ncircumstances, the presence of Applicant\u2019s family members in Lebanon triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of, or resident in \na foreign county if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \nApplicant never cultivated close relationships with his siblings because they are \nseveral years older and had grown up and left home when he was a pre-teen. Two of his \nbrothers live in the United States. One of these brothers living in the United States has \nbeen living here for more than 18 years and the other brother living in the United States has \nlived here for more than 40 years. Although both of Applicant\u2019s sisters live in Lebanon his \ncontact with them is limited. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence of exploitation,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his brother that splits his time between the United States \nand Lebanon is similarly casual and infrequent. However, the casual and infrequent nature \nof their relation is outweighed by the security concern generated by this brother\u2019s previous \nposition as a brigadier general in the Lebanese army. In addition, Applicant\u2019s relation with \nhis parents is clearly not casual because he supports them financially and talks to his \nmother three to four times per week. Consequently, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with these relatives living in Lebanon. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant is an intensely patriotic U.S. citizen with a tattoo of an American flag on his \narm. He has performed admirably with the U.S. military while working for multiple \ncontractors in support of the U.S. interest, at times, in dangerous situations where he has \nexchanged fire in combat against enemy forces. This history of support of the United States \nunder the gravest of circumstances is a significant indicator that Applicant would resolve in \nthe U.S. interest any attempts by the Lebanese government or any extranational entity \noperating in Lebanon to pressure or influence him. (ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. \nBd., Feb 5, 2008)) Under these circumstances, I conclude that the mitigating condition set \nforth in AG \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected resolve any conflict of \ninterests in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nforeign interest security concerns with respect to his family contacts in Lebanon. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, particularly with respect to my analysis of Applicant\u2019s meritorious \nservice in support of the U.S. military while in combat. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \nthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(d), and 20(g) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nand taxes are ongoing, and not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nHe has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his debts or taxes. \nHis behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s former spouse\u2019s debt, marital debt, \ndivorce, and underemployment were largely beyond his control. However, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is not fully established.

Applicant has not provided evidence to substantiate \nthe basis of any disputed debt or provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nmilitary service, and employment history, and that his financial problems were caused, in \npart, by circumstances beyond his control. Although I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nclearance.

His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old. He has worked for defense contractors since January \n2018. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. He is married but has no \nchildren. He has held a security clearance since 2018. (Tr. 11, 54-55; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on his March 2018 security clearance application (SCA), and his March 2021 \nSCA when he failed to disclose his illegal drug use of marijuana, cocaine, and Adderall, \nat various times on both SCAs. It also alleged he failed to disclose his purchases of \nmarijuana, at various times, on both SCAs. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) \nApplicant's answers were false because he admitted using marijuana various \ntimes in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He admitted purchasing marijuana at various times in 2014 \nand 2015. He admitted using cocaine once in 2016 and once in 2017. His last use of \nillegal drugs was in 2017. (None of this conduct was alleged in the SOR and it will not be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be used for credibility, mitigation, and for a \nwhole-person assessment.) Applicant admitted intentionally falsifying his answers to the \nMarch 2021 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases. He did so because he \nwas afraid that if he answered truthfully on his March 2021 SCA, the inconsistency of his \nanswers with his March 2018 SCA answers would cost him his job. (Tr. 24-25, 27, 30; GE \n2, 3) \nAt the time Applicant filled out his first SCA in March 2018, he was working for his \nfirst defense contractor (DC1). He admitted the falsity of the information that he submitted \non his 2018 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases, but denied any deliberate \nintent to deceive with that information. Rather, he maintains that he misunderstood the \nquestion and provided the negative response based upon his misunderstanding. He \nbelieved the question was asking him if he was currently using any illegal drugs or if he \nhad a drug addiction problem. He maintained that he had no reason to report to his \nsecurity officer or any other management official his false answers on this 2018 SCA any \ntime before his realization that he misunderstood the questions, which did not occur until \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe was completing his March 2021 SCA. Applicant testified that he did not undergo a \nbackground interview with an investigator after submitting his March 2018 SCA. There is \nno evidence in the record of a background interview after he submitted his March 2018 \nSCA, or before completing his March 2021 SCA. (Tr. 23-24, 45; GE 1-2) \nThe Section 23 of the SCAs states as follows: \nIn the last seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, \ninhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug \nor controlled substance? \nIn the last seven years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase . . . \nof any drug or controlled substance? \nApplicant responded with \u201cNo\u201d answers to both the above questions. (Tr. 23; GE 1-2) \nApplicant testified that he considers himself a detailed-oriented person. A witness \nalso acknowledged that Applicant was detailed oriented in his work where he had to \ncomprehend schematics and planning documents. (Tr. 45, 75) \nApplicant denied that he misused the prescription drug Adderall and therefore his \nMarch 2018 SCA answer indicating the same was not a deliberate false answer. He was \nprescribed Adderall while in college. His doctor recommended taking the medication in \nthe morning with food. Sometimes he took the medicine in the evenings so he could stay \nawake to study. Upon completing interrogatories in December 2022, he stated that it was \nwrong and illegal for him to do so (taking Adderall in the evenings). Since supplying that \nanswer, he has come to realize that he did not misuse the prescription because he never \nexceeded the prescribed dosage and while the recommended dosage taking time was in \nthe morning, there was no legal prohibition preventing him from taking the medication \nlater in the day, as needed. (Tr. 25, GE 3 (See interrogatory narrative answers under \u201cII. \nDRUG USE\u201d); SOR Answer) \nIn March 2021, Applicant was hired by a second defense contractor (DC2), his \ncurrent employer. He completed a new SCA in March 2021. He testified that when he \nwas completing the drug use/abuse section of this SCA, he realized that he had \nmisunderstood the related questions listed above when he completed his March 2018 \nSCA. At this moment, he understood that the questions were asking whether in the past \nseven years he had used or purchased illegal drugs and that his March 2018 SCA \nanswers were false. He again answered falsely to the March 2021 SCA drug questions \nknowing they were false at the time. (Tr. 27, 30, 47; GE 1) \nThese answers were false because he admitted using marijuana various times in \n2014, 2015 and 2017. He admitted purchasing marijuana at various times in 2014 and \n2015.

Applicant admitted intentionally falsifying his answers to the March \n2021 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases. He did so because he was afraid \nthat if he answered truthfully on his March 2021 SCA, the inconsistency of his answers \nwith his March 2018 SCA answers would cost him his job. (Tr. 24-25, 27, 30; GE 2, 3) \nOn March 11, 2021, Applicant signed and certified his SCA answers were true, \ncomplete, and correct, after acknowledging the warning under 18 USC 1001, which sets \nforth the consequences of providing intentionally false information. He claims that he felt \nguilty almost immediately about intentionally providing false answers on his March 2021 \nSCA after he completed it. He even lost sleep thinking about his dishonest answers. He \ndid not inform his supervisor or facility security officer about what he did. Instead, he \nwaited approximately seven weeks until his background interview on April 28, 2021, to \nbring it up with the investigator. He initially testified that he thought his background \ninterview was just two weeks after he completed his March 2021 SCA. (Tr. 28-29, 49, 58; \nGE 1, 3) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s April 28, 2021, background interview, after he was administered \nthe oath, he immediately admitted his past drug use and history. He admitted giving false \ninformation about his past drug use on his 2021 SCA, as well as on his 2018 SCA. He \ntold the investigator he did this because he was scared that he would not get a clearance \nand might lose his job. There is no mention of Applicant stating he misunderstood the \n2018 SCA questions about past drug use. He further expressed his regrets for providing \nthe false information. (GE 3 (See enhanced subject interview)) \nApplicant regrets his poor decisions. To help with his future decision-making, he \ncompleted an education program entitled \u201cDiscovering Better Choices.\u201d He learned that \nhe cannot let his own moral values be compromised by the decisions he makes. He must \nbe honest and accept the consequences of his actions. (Tr. 32-33; AE A)  \nApplicant had three witnesses testify for him. Two of the witnesses know him \nthrough his current job. Both spoke highly of his honesty, trustworthiness, work ethic, and \ncommunication skills. Both recommended that he continue to have access to classified \ninformation. The third witness is a family friend who has known Applicant since he was a \nchild. This witness is also a retired military officer who held a security clearance. He \ndescribed Applicant as honest, truthful, and reliable. He knows that Applicant deeply \nregrets his actions that brought him here. He has no security concerns about Applicant. \n(Tr. 60-61, 63-64, 71-75, 80, 83-86) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his March \n2021 SCA concerning his past use of marijuana and cocaine, and his past purchases of \nmarijuana. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nIn both the March 2018 SCA and March 2021 SCA, Applicant denied any misuse \nof Adderall and the Government failed to produce substantial evidence to the contrary. \nDeliberate falsifications as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f were not established. \nAs far as the alleged falsifications of Applicant\u2019s March 2018 SCA, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant denied any deliberate falsifications. He claimed that he \nmisunderstood the question at the time and answered it based upon his \nmisunderstanding. He believed the question was asking about any current drug use or \ndrug addiction problems. I do not find Applicant\u2019s denial and explanation credible. I draw \nthis conclusion based upon several factors. (1) Applicant is a college-educated engineer; \n(2) Both he and a witness describe Applicant as a detail-oriented person; (3) A plain \nreading of the questions at issue reveals, without any ambiguity, the questions ask about \nany drug use and purchases in the last seven years. There is no language in the questions \nasking about \u201ccurrent\u201d use or purchases or \u201caddiction problems;\u201d (4) Applicant admitted \nhis falsifications to an investigator when interviewed in April 2021, however, he failed to \ntell the investigator that he misunderstood the questions on his March 2018 SCA; (5) He \nadmitted to his investigator and during his testimony that he was afraid that if he provided \ntruthful information, he would lose his job. \nBased upon the above factors, I conclude that Applicant deliberately provided false \ninformation on his March 2018 SCA concerning his past use of marijuana and cocaine, \nand his purchases of marijuana. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant did not make prompt good-faith efforts to disclose his falsifications on his \nMarch 2018 SCA. He failed to inform his security officer or company officials. Since I did \nnot find his explanation as to why he gave false information on his March 2018 SCA \ncredible, I do not find his argument compelling that he did not inform anyone because he \nwas unaware there was a problem with his answers until he completed his March 2021 \nSCA. He had a chance to \u201ccome clean\u201d when he completed his March 2021 SCA by \nanswering the drug questions honestly, but he chose to lie about them once again. While \nI will give Applicant some mitigation credit for telling his background investigator about \nhis previous falsifications on both SCAs, this disclosure is insufficient to overcome the \ntotality of his lack of trustworthiness. Although he ultimately disclosed his drug use and \npurchases during his 2021 background interview, he was granted a security clearance in \n2018 based upon his earlier false statements. Deliberately providing false information on \nan SCA is not a minor offense. It strikes at the heart of the security clearance investigation \nprocess. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the good character testimony \noffered by Applicant\u2019s witnesses. I also considered his completion of the Discovering \nBetter Choices education program. However, I also considered he deliberately falsified \nboth his March 2018 SCA, which resulted in him receiving a security clearance, and his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nMarch 2021 SCA. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He married in 2007 and has two minor children and an \nadult stepchild. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015. He has worked for his \nemployer, a federal contractor, since August 2021.

In 2016, he went to a Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) Article 15 nonjudicial punishment hearing after he tested positive \nfor marijuana on a random urinalysis. His wife provided a letter that stated she is a \nmarijuana user in a state where it is legal.

(Items 2, 3, 4, 6) \nApplicant disclosed on his July 2022 security clearance application (SCA) that his \nfirst background investigation for a security clearance occurred in 2007, and he was \ngranted a secret clearance. He was on active duty in the military at the time. In 2016, he \nhad another background investigation for eligibility for a security clearance, in which he \nwas again granted a secret clearance. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in March 2023. As part of them, \nhe affirmed that his statements made to government investigators were correct, and he \nhad no additions or corrections. (Item 4) \nAs part of his security clearance investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in November 2018. He explained to the investigator the \ncircumstances surrounding his 2016 UMCJ Article 15 hearing after testing positive for \nmarijuana on a urinalysis. He said his wife provided a letter to the commander explaining \nthe circumstances, and he was subsequently acquitted of the charge.

(Item 4) \nIn September 2019 Applicant failed another random urinalysis when he tested \npositive for marijuana. He admitted he had been using marijuana twice a week for three \nor four months in 2019. Applicant held a security clearance at this time. He went to a \nUCMJ Article 15 disciplinary hearing. He was found guilty at the hearing and received 45 \ndays extra duty. He attended a drug education class. It was recommended that he be \ndischarged from the military for misconduct due to drug use. He went before an \nadministrative discharge board, and it was recommended that he be retained and \nmedically retired. He was subsequently medically retired and received an Honorable \nDischarge. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nOn his July 2022 SCA, Applicant disclosed his 2019 UCMJ Article 15 noting the \noffense charged was \u201cconsumption of a control substance, THC.\u201d He wrote \u201cFOUND NOT \nGUILTY; EXTRA DUTY.\u201d Documentary evidence and his previous statements made to \nthe government investigator clearly prove he was found guilty at his 2019 Article 15 \nhearing for wrongful use of marijuana and then was administratively processed for \nseparation from the military. (Items 3, 5) \nThe SOR does not allege these falsifications, and I will not consider them for \ndisqualifying purposes, but may consider them in the application of mitigating conditions \nand in my whole-person analysis. \nSection 23 of the SCA-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity states: \nWe note, with reference to this section, that neither your truthful responses \nnor information derived from your responses to this section will be used as \nevidence against you in a subsequent criminal proceeding. As to this \nparticular section, this applies whether or not you are currently employed by \nthe Federal government. The following questions pertain to the illegal use \nof drugs or controlled substances or drug or controlled substance activity in \naccordance with Federal laws, even though permissible under state laws.  \nThis section then asks: \nIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances: Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, \nsnorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming \nany drug or controlled substance.  \nIn the last seven (7) years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, \nmanufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, \nreceiving, handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance?  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHave you EVER illegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a\ndrug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other\nthan previously listed. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to each question. During his September 2022 \nbackground interview, he told the government investigator that he used marijuana twice \na week for three to four months in 2019 for pain management when lifting weights and \nbecause pain medications did not work. He purchased it from a dispensary. He told the \ninvestigator that his wife continues to use marijuana in their state where it is legal. He \nsaid her use does not impact his employment. His oldest daughter, after she was 18 years \nold, has used marijuana after surgery. He had no thoughts regarding the fact that \npossession of marijuana is against federal law. He said if it became legal under federal \nlaw, he would use it if his employer permitted it. (Items 3, 4) \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s March 2023 interrogatories, he stated he had not used \nmarijuana since September 2019. He could not recall when he last purchased marijuana. \nHe stated he did not intend to use it in the future. He stated the reason was because, \u201cIt \nis prohibited in my line of work.\u201d (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer he admitted that in 2019 he used marijuana for three \nto four months twice a week while in the military. He admitted he purchased it and used \nit despite the potential ramifications and fact that he had gone to an Article 15 hearing in \n2016 when he consumed his wife\u2019s drink laced with marijuana. He admitted he held a \nsecurity clearance in 2019 and held a sensitive position while attached to an elite unit in \nthe military. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his July 2022 \nSCA his drug use in the last seven years and his drug use while holding a security \nclearance. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but then states he \ndid not intend to falsify material facts and not tell the truth. He stated the following: \nI misunderstood the line of questioning. I was under the impression that \nsince those incidents had already been adjudicated and also handled on \nthe military side, and no other incidents had occurred since then, that the \nanswer was \u201cno\u201d. In addition, those incidents were thoroughly discussed \nwith the investigator during my interview, which demonstrates that I was \nclearly not trying to withhold information.  \nI spoke with the investigator during the in person interview, where she asked \nme a series of questions regarding past THC use and I answered all her \nquestions candidly; just as I did back in 2018 for my SECRET clearance \ninterview, referencing the accidental consumption in 2016. (Item 2) \nHe further stated in his SOR answer, \u201cAs a former service member, I would not try to \ncoverup that factual occurrence, knowing it would be the first thing noticed within my \n[military] background.\u201d He said he has learned his lesson and has sought alternative pain \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanagement from his physician.

He has always taken operational security very seriously. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant held a security clearance and a sensitive position while part of an elite \nmilitary unit when he knowingly used marijuana twice a week for three to four months in \n2019. He purchased marijuana at a dispensary. He tested positive for marijuana during \na random urinalysis test. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (the Security Executive \nAgent (SecEA)) issued DNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the SecEA promulgated clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life to \ndetermine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nIn 2019, Applicant knowingly used marijuana for three to four months while holding \na security clearance and a sensitive position as part of an elite military unit. He previously \nhad been put on notice of the seriousness of illegal drug use during a 2016 UCMJ Article \n15 hearing where he was found not guilty for marijuana use due to an unknowing ingestion \nfrom his wife\u2019s drink. In his November 2018 background interview, he said he had no \nintention of using marijuana in the future, and he and his wife had taken extra precautions \nto prevent a similar situation from happening. He said he had no additional instances of \nuse of an illegal drug or controlled substance, including while holding a security clearance. \nMonths later he began using marijuana. It is somewhat baffling that he was obviously \naware of the military\u2019s random urinalysis testing policy and the strict anti-drug policy, \nwhich he flaunted with his regular marijuana use. In his March 2023 response to \ninterrogatories, he again stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. \nI do not find his statements credible about his intent to refrain from future illegal \ndrug use. I also do not find his statement credible that he takes operational security \nseriously when he was using marijuana regularly over three to four months while holding \na security clearance and in a sensitive position. He had an opportunity to provide a \nresponse to the FORM to update whether he continued to abstain from marijuana use. \nHe did not provide information about his current use or about whether his wife continues \nto use marijuana in their home. Because Applicant requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his illegal drug use \nor evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-\n12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). I am unable to conclude Applicant\u2019s drug use was \nso long ago or happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His knowing, \nfrequent, and deliberate use while on active duty raises serious concerns about his \nreliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will\nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national\nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .. \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana in 2019, which resulted in a UCMJ Article \n15 disciplinary hearing where he was found guilty. On his July 2022 SCA he did not \ndisclose his frequent drug use from 2019 when he responded \u201cno\u201d to questions about his \nuse in the last seven years. He also responded \u201cno\u201d to the SCA question that asked if he \nhad ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Applicant explained in his \nanswer to the SOR that he misunderstood the questions and believed that because his \ndrug use had been adjudicated by the military and no additional drug use had occurred \nsince then, his \u201cno\u201d response was accurate. I do not find these explanations credible. \nApplicant indicated he held a security clearance for 19 years and had completed other \nSCAs. He said as a former uniformed person he would not try to cover up that factual \noccurrence, knowing it would be the first thing noticed within his military background. \nHowever, he failed to disclose his drug use and Article 15 under the military history \nsection, which would have put the government on notice about his past drug use. \nApplicant told the investigator in 2018 that he did not intend to use illegal drugs \nand then months later proceeded to use marijuana for three to four months while holding \na security clearance and a sensitive position. The SCA question specifically asked if he \nused illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He responded \u201cno.\u201d Considering \nApplicant\u2019s background and experience, I find he deliberately failed to disclose his past \ndrug use and while holding a security clearance or sensitive position. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate the \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana in 2019, despite his experience of testing \npositive for it in 2016, which resulted in a UCMJ Article 15 hearing where he was found \nnot guilty. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsification before \nhe was interviewed by a government investigator. I did not find his explanations credible \nfor his failure to disclose his past illegal drug use and while holding a security clearance. \nHe did not disclose it under the military history section of the SCA. With his military \nexperience, background, and holding a security clearance for many years, I do not believe \nhis failure to disclose his drug misconduct was because he did not understand the \nquestions. \nFailure to be honest on an SCA is not a minor offense and strikes at the very heart \nof the security clearance process. His conduct and falsifications did not happen under \nunique circumstances. He obviously continues to associate with his wife who presumably \nstill uses marijuana. He did not provide evidence of steps he has taken to eliminate his \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. None of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has four adult children. (Tr. 42-43; GE 1; GE 2; AE F) \nOn December 2, 2019, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. (GE 1) A \nsubsequent background investigation raised the security concerns listed in the SOR. \nUnder the Guideline K \u2013 Handling Protected Information security concern, the \nSOR alleged Applicant, in or around 2007, improperly took home a classified cover \nsheet. Instead of returning the cover sheet and reporting the incident, he destroyed the \ncover sheet by tearing it into little pieces and consuming them. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 3 at 9-\n10). He improperly took home a printed e-mail that contained protected information. \nWhen he surrendered the e-mail at a nearby SCIF in 2020, he declined to file a report. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: GE 3 at 10-11).  \nUnder the Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct security concern, the SOR alleged: \nApplicant failed to fully and timely report or disclose the conduct in subparagraphs 1.a \nand 1.b (SOR \u00b6 2.a: GE 3 at 9-11); and he was terminated from his employment with \nContractor A after the government customer requested he be removed from their \nproject. (SOR \u00b6 2.b: GE 1 at 15-16; GE 3 at 7) \nIn 2007, Applicant was a federal contractor working at Government Agency #1. \nWhile working there, he often printed unclassified e-mails, unclassified documents, and \nunclassified power point slides. He took them home to use for work or for scrap paper to \nwrite notes on. One day, he printed out a handful of unclassified documents to use as \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrap paper. After printing out the documents, he left work and drove home. Once he \narrived home, he went to his office to do some work. When going through the \nunclassified documents he had just brought home, he discovered a classified cover \nsheet from the printer where he printed his unclassified documents. He claims it was an \nunclassified printer and the cover sheet did not contain classified information, but there \nwas a statement on the cover sheet stating to treat the cover sheet as classified \ninformation. (Tr. 21-24; GE 3 at 9, 22-23, 51) \nApplicant decided to tear up the cover sheet into little pieces and ate it rather \nthan turning it into the office and reporting the incident. He chose to eat the document \nbecause he assumed it would be unrecoverable. He claims this was his first job \ninvolving classified information and that he was not trained on how to handle this \nincident. He never reported the incident to his security officials or supervisor. He did not \nremember whether he had a duty to report this incident. In 2018 or 2019, he underwent \na polygraph exam with Government Agency #2. He was applying for Top Secret \u2013 \nSensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) access. He failed the polygraph. The \npolygrapher asked him if there was anything that caused him to fail the polygraph. He \ntold the polygrapher about the 2007 incident where he swallowed the classified cover \nsheet. He is embarrassed about this incident. He handled it poorly and apologized. In \nhindsight, he should have taken the fax cover sheet back to the office and told his \nsupervisor. (Tr. 23-26, 47-57; GE 3 at 9-10, 21-23) \nShortly after this polygraph, Applicant began to destroy the unclassified \ndocuments that he took home from various work sites. He had over 1,000 pages of \nunclassified documents at his home. In April 2020, while cleaning out documents, he \ndiscovered an e-mail from the 2007 timeframe that he had marked as Confidential. He \nimmediately became concerned and took the document and surrendered it to the \nnearest Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), which was located at a \nmilitary installation. He stopped at the main gate and informed the security police that \nhe wanted to turn a classified document into the SCIF. He had to wait for a person who \nheld a security clearance and had access to the SCIF. When the person arrived, \nApplicant explained how he discovered the document and that he thought it best to \nsurrender it to the SCIF for safekeeping. He was there for over an hour, possibly two. \nAt the end of discussions, he was asked if he would like to make a formal report. He \ndeclined, indicating that he provided them the information and did not want to take up \nany more of their time. He stated one of the military policemen told him informally that \nhe should have just shredded the document. He did not know that he was required to \nmake a formal written report. He understood the report to be optional. There is nothing \nin the record indicating that he was required to make a formal written report. (Tr. 27-34, \n59-66; GE 3 at 9, 23-24; AE A) \nApplicant describes both incidents as accidents. He believes that he had over-\nclassified the e-mail involved in the 2020 incident out of an abundance of caution. He \nalso printed out unclassified documents to take home because they showed his \naccomplishments on various projects that he worked on. He has since destroyed all of \nthe unclassified documents that he brought home and no longer prints out any \nunclassified documents to take home. He claimed it was more common to print out \ndocuments back then than it is today.

He was never told why his position on the \ncontract ended and does not believe he did anything wrong. All he was told is that he \nwas removed from his position at the request of the government customer. Contractor A \nattempted to find a position for him on another government contract but was \nunsuccessful. On April 16, 2018, they terminated his employment. They indicated that \nthey enjoyed having him as a member of the team, appreciated his hard work, and \nwished him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Applicant was unemployed for \nabout a month. He easily found employment with another contractor. (Tr. 34-39, 73-79; \nGE 1, section 13A at 15-16; AE B; AE C) \nWhole-person Evidence \nMr. M., a government customer, wrote an e-mail to the contractor who employed \nApplicant in 2022 praising his duty performance. He said he was impressed with \nApplicant\u2019s \u201clevel of detail, expert knowledge, peer mentoring support, and overall \nperformance.\u201d Mr. M. was grateful to have his thoughtful risk analysis and broader \ntechnical experience to help him make decisions for the organization. He indicated \nApplicant was \u201cour best contractor staff.\u201d (AE I) \nUnalleged Conduct \nThe following incidents were raised during the hearing. They are not alleged in \nthe SOR. I consider each instance under matters of extenuation and mitigation and not \nas matters of disqualification. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant volunteered that he two minor incidents involving \nwalking into a SCIF with his cell phone between 2017 and 2019. The first time occurred \nbetween 2017 and 2018, he was going to a meeting in a SCIF and forgot to put his cell \nphone in a cell phone receptacle outside the SCIF. He felt his pocket after going \nthrough a turnstile. He had not entered the SCIF. He immediately turned around and put \nhis cell phone in a cell phone receptacle. The second time occurred between 2018 and \n2019, he forgot to put the cell phone in a cell phone receptacle before entering the \nSCIF. He discovered he still had his cell phone before the start of the meeting. He \nimmediately went outside the SCIF to put his cell phone in a cell phone receptacle. (Tr. \n72-73, 91-94) Both incidents are similar, relatively minor and appear to have been \noversights that Applicant caught before entering the SCIF and/or before the classified \nmeeting in the SCIF began. It is highly unlikely classified information was compromised. \nApplicant also testified during the hearing that he was abruptly terminated from \ncontracts with five different employers. (Tr. 82-84) It is unclear whether there was any \nmisconduct or security issues on Applicant\u2019s part in each of these instances. There is no \nevidence that any of the employers or government customers filed a security incident \nreport. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information \u2013 raises \ndoubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern.  \nAG \u00b6 34 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe following potentially apply to Applicant: \nAG \u00b6 34(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized \nlocation; and \nAG \u00b6 34(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 34(b) and AG \u00b6 34(g) apply. The evidence supports that Applicant stored \nclassified information at home. While inadvertent, he was not authorized to take and \nstore classified information at home. He also failed to comply with the rules pertaining \nthe protection of classified and sensitive information when he chose to tear into little \npieces and eat the classified cover sheet in 2007. He also failed to insure that the \ndocuments that he took home during that time did not include classified information. \nThirteen years later, he discovered that he had taken home an e-mail that was marked \nConfidential that was mixed in with the unclassified documents that he took home. \nDuring his career, Applicant took home up to 1,000 documents. It is not clear whether \nany of these documents were sensitive. Upon discovering the Confidential e-mail, \nApplicant\u2019s decision to turn the document into the closest SCIF from his house was \nprudent. He fully disclosed how he came to possess the confidential document to the \nofficials at the base where he surrendered the document. There is nothing in the record \nthat indicates he was required to file a formal report. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information. The burden \nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)) \nGuideline K also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Handling Protected Information. The following mitigating \nconditions potentially apply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances , that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 35(c) the security violations were due to improper or in adequate \ntraining or unclear instructions; and \nAG \u00b6 35(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is \nno evidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nAG \u00b6 35(a) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a, more than 17 years have passed \nsince Applicant discovered he inadvertently took home a classified cover sheet. There \nremains a question as to whether the cover sheet itself was classified. While Applicant \nshould have returned the cover sheet to the office and informed his supervisor or \nsecurity officer of what happened, it was an unusual occurrence. \nAG \u00b6 35(a) also applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant inadvertently took \nhome a paper that was classified as Confidential in 2007. It was mixed in with many \nother unclassified documents that he took home. Upon the document\u2019s discovery in \n2020, he immediately turned the document into the nearest SCIF that was located on a \nmilitary installation. He provided full disclosure to the authorities when he surrendered \nthe document. Several years have passed since this incident and it is unlikely to recur \nsince Applicant no longer brings documents home. \nAG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply. While Applicant claims he was not fully trained before \nthe 2007 incident, he admitted that he chose to eat the document because he did not \nwant to drive back to work. His decision was made for his own personal convenience. I \nalso considered that he did not disclose this incident until his 2018/2019 polygraph. \nAG \u00b6 35(d) partially applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a because the violation was initially \ninadvertent and there appears to be no evidence of a compromise. It is unclear whether \nthe faxed cover sheet was even classified. While he did not exercise the best judgment \nwhen he decided to eat the fax cover sheet, he destroyed the document. I cannot \nconclude he promptly reported the incident. He did not disclose this incident until a \n2018/2019 polygraph interview. \nAG \u00b6 35(d) also applies to SOR \u00b6 1.b. He inadvertently took home an e-mail \nwhich he labeled as Confidential. Upon the discovery of the e-mail, he promptly \nreported the incident, He immediately took the e-mail to a military installation that had a \nSCIF. The likelihood of compromise is low since the document was mixed in with a lot of \nunclassified documents that Applicant kept in his home. \nWhile both of these incidents raise concerns, they were relatively minor and it is \nunlikely there was a compromise of classified information. Overall, Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns raised under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) Engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a, \u201cYou failed to fully and timely report or disclose the \nconduct in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, as required.\u201d, and with respect to the allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a, both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) apply. The conduct alleged was the 2007 \nincident where Applicant discovered that he took home a classified cover sheet and ate \nthe document rather than taking it back to the office. He failed to insure that he did not \ntake home classified information, his decision to eat the classified fax cover sheet, and \nfailure to report the incident to his chain of command and/or security officials raise \nquestions about his trustworthiness, reliability and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The concealment of this incident also created a vulnerability. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to promptly disclose the incident made him vulnerable to exploitation or \nmanipulation. \nI find for Applicant with respect to the second allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, addressing \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. When he discovered that he had inadvertently taken home an e-mail \nclassified as Confidential, he immediately drove to a local military installation to turn it \ninto a SCIF. He cooperated with the authorities at the military installation.

Applicant testified he was never informed why he was removed from the \ncontract. The evidence is insufficient to conclude that Applicant\u2019s termination from the \nproject at the government customer\u2019s request raised a security concern. I note that the \ncontractor attempted to place him on other contracts. They were unable to find another \ncontract, so they had to let him go. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other appropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a. It has been over 17 years, since \nApplicant ate the classified cover sheet and failed to report it to his supervisory chain. \nHe fully disclosed the incident during a polygraph exam in 2018. The record remains \nunclear as to whether the cover sheet itself was actually classified. There were no \nclassified markings on the cover sheet. There was a statement on the cover sheet that \nthe cover sheet should be treated as classified information. While Applicant should have \ntaken the more reasonable approach and returned the fax cover sheet to the office as \nwell as disclosed the incident to his supervisor, his conduct is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. Applicant was terminated in April \n2018 from Contractor A after the government customer requested he be removed from \nthe project. There is nothing in the record that provides a basis for his removal. There is \nnothing in the record that shows this is related to him being a security risk. There is no \nevidence that government customer filed a security incident report. Since 2018 and \n2019, Applicant has worked for numerous contractors. While he admits to being \nremoved from five different government contracts, the record does not show the basis \nfor these removals. The record evidence is lacking as to whether Applicant created a \nsecurity concern when he was taken off these contracts. He could have been taken off \nthe contracts due to other reasons such as insufficient work, personality conflicts, failure \nto fit in with the office culture, etc. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies. Applicant acknowledged that he did not report the 2007 \nincident involving the faxed cover sheet for classified information. Regarding the \ndiscovery of a confidential e-mail in 2020, Applicant immediately turned this document \n9 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ninto a local SCIF. Applicant\u2019s decision to take home a lot of unclassified documents for \nhis personal files was the not the best judgment. He failed to insure that no classified \ndocuments were among the documents that he took home. He has since reviewed and \ndestroyed the documents that he took home earlier in his career. He no longer takes \nunclassified documents home. He has taken steps to prevent these issues from \nhappening again. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies because Applicant disclosed both minor security incidents. He \nhas reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nAt times in the past, Applicant has not demonstrated the best judgment in relation \nto handling classified and sensitive documents. However, his past security incidents \nwere relatively minor. They do not appear to have compromised classified information. \nHe no longer takes unclassified documents home. I found him to be forthcoming during \nthe hearing. While he has been removed from government contracts at the request of \nthe government customer on several occasions, the record evidence is unclear as to the \nbasis for his removal from each contract. It is not unusual for employees to move often \nin contract positions. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns under Handling \nProtected Information and Personal Conduct are mitigated. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) could not render affirmative \nfindings required to grant a security clearance and issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), dated December 21, 2022, detailing security concerns raised by the \nguidelines for drug involvement (Guideline H), and personal conduct (Guideline E).

He admitted \nthe first sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.a (drug involvement) but denied that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future as alleged in the second sentence of the \nallegation. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c. He did not answer (admit or \ndeny) SOR \u00b6 2.a (personal conduct). Instead, he directed the adjudicator to refer to the \nanswers to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The lack of an answer is interpreted as a denial of \nthe allegation. He provided an explanation for his answers to the drug involvement \nallegations. He stated that he stopped using THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD \n(cannabidiol) oils in early December 2022 due to the positive outcome of the second \nsurgery in September 2022 and ongoing therapy. As noted below, he resumed use of \nvarious forms and strengths of THC/CBD because of a painfully deteriorating medical \ncondition that was inadequately controlled with opioids. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on February 28, 2024, for a hearing on April 16, 2024. The live in-person \nhearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibits, (GE) 1 and 3 were entered \ninto evidence without objection. (Tr. 11) GE 2 was objected to because there was no \nGovernment witness to authenticate the exhibit. The objection was granted, and GE 2 \nwas withdrawn pursuant to E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6. (Tr. 9, 131) Applicant\u2019s 11 \nexhibits, (AE) A through K (bound in a black binder), were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. (Tr. 12) DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 25, 2024, \nand the record closed the same day. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is single and has a 17-year-old daughter. (Tr. 16) \nHe is engaged to his fianc\u00e9 that he has been living with since about 2020. (Tr. 16) From \nNovember 2017 to the present, he has been a self-employed subcontractor working \nthrough a contractor on defense projects for the United States Army (USA). (Tr. 18-20) \nFrom February 2018 to June 2020, he was a sales consultant for a multinational \ncomputer service company. From August 2017 to November 2017, he was self-\nemployed as a chief economic officer (CEO) of a company. From August 2014 to \nAugust 2017, he was a principal consultant and technical manager of a defense \ncontractor. In 2016, he received his first security clearance and has had access to \nclassified information since that year but has not always worked on classified \ninformation. (Tr. 77, 92-93) He was a data systems architect from November 2010 to \nAugust 2014. Prior to 2010, he worked in various contractor jobs or in state agency \npositions.

He was charged with forgery, a felony, in March 1997 and placed \non probation until 2001. The criminal conviction was expunged. (GE 1 at 37) He used \nmarijuana (THC) once in 2013 to ease work-related stress. When the drug did not \nrelieve his stress, he stopped using the drug. In August 2021 and under medical \nsupervision, he resumed using the drug in different forms and strengths for pain \nassociated with hip issues. He was using THC, including topical oils, because the hip \npain interfered with his sleep. He was using the drug for medical purposes deemed \nlegal under state law. The THC or hemp-related products enabled him to discontinue \nopioid medication for a period. Reflecting on his use of hemp-based products, Applicant \ncredibly testified that he never used the drug for recreation, but to tranquilize his hip \npain. (GE 1 at 38-39; Tr. 30-36, 84-85) \nFor about a year before his first surgery in December 2020, Applicant had been \nexperiencing acute hip pain when he walked or jogged. (Tr. 30-31) Two months after \nthe surgery, his pain became more intense, and he was sent to a pain specialist who \nprescribed a variety of drugs. In his medical notes, the pain specialist described \nApplicant\u2019s medical condition, his medications (both opioid and non-opioid), and other \nmedical procedures administered on his hip and the nerves controlling pain in the area. \nThe specialist noted that Applicant\u2019s hip pain interfered with his sleep and concentration \nat work as a subcontractor for the USA. Based on the comments from his other patients \nwho achieved relief from the THC/CBD oils, the pain specialist indicated to Applicant \nthat it was okay to use hemp products for medicinal purposes under medical \nsupervision, even with his security clearance. Applicant resumed using THC products in \nAugust 2021 when he could not sleep because of the pain. He legally purchased the \ndrug at least a couple of times legally at drug dispensaries. He never purchased the \ndrug illegally. He indicated in his June 2022 security clearance application that he used \nthe drug while possessing a security clearance and would use it in the future under \nmedical supervision. (GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 32-45, 47, 50, 51, 90-91; AE A at 1-37) \nBecause of lingering pain, Applicant had an arthroscopy performed on his hip in \nSeptember 2022. And he began physical therapy shortly afterward. His medications \nbefore and after the September 2022 surgery are listed in the medical records of the \ntreating doctor. (AE B at 2-3, 9, 14-15; Tr. 51-55) \nIn a medical note dated January 6, 2023, summarizing Applicant\u2019s treatment at \nthe above date, and entitled \u201cLETTER OF MEDICAL NECESSITY,\u201d one of Applicant\u2019s \ntreating doctors (Dr. AA) indicated that Applicant stopped using hemp-based products \nafter his surgery in September 2022. As noted in his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nceased using the hemp-based products in December 2022. However, the period of \nabstinence that followed was temporary. At some time in 2023, Dr. AA encouraged him \nto reduce and replace his THC use with the CBD alternative.

Dr. AB indicated \nthat he had been treating Applicant for over a year (since January 2023) with low dose \nTHC oil, hip injections, spinal injections, and physical therapy. Dr. AB\u2019s chronology of \ntreatment tends to controvert Applicant\u2019s testimonial claim that he stopped using all \nhemp-based products in March or April 2023. (Tr. 65) Dr. AB and Applicant were aware \nthat THC use was against federal law, but Dr. AB explained that the state law certified \nhim to prescribe low dose THC oil under stringent conditions. Applicant\u2019s THC card \nauthorized him to receive low-dose THC oil. (Tr. 61, 64; AE E) Dr. AB noted that \nApplicant\u2019s intensifying pain and depression, coupled with his desire to comply with \nfederal laws regarding illegal drug use and concern for his future employment, \ncompelled the need to shift from low-dose THC oil use to opioids and surgery. Applicant \nstopped all use of hemp-based products in August 2023. Dr. AB referred Applicant to \nDr. CD for a complete hip replacement that was scheduled for April 18, 2024, two days \nafter the hearing. (AE F; Tr. 66), Dr. AB agreed that Applicant should eventually quit his \nuse of opioid medication and step up his exercise regimen. (AE D at 1-3; Tr. 58-61, 65) \nThe drug policy of Applicant\u2019s current employer prohibits illegal drug use under \nany circumstances. He could not recall whether his employer requires employees to \nreport illegal drug use. He has never been randomly tested for drugs but is willing to \nundergo such testing in the future. (Tr. 120-121, 126-127) Applicant\u2019s urinalysis in \nMarch 2024 registered negative results for marijuana and several other drugs. (AE J) \nOn April 12, 2024, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal substances, acknowledging that future drug involvement would be grounds for \nrevocation of his national security eligibility. (AE K) \nApplicant testified that he does not associate with drug users. His fianc\u00e9 does \nnot use THC. He has never used any other illegal drugs or been arrested for illegal \ndrugs. He has never associated with individuals who use drugs. (Tr. 124-125) \nCharacter Evidence \nOn April 5, 2024, Applicant\u2019s manager indicated in a letter that he self-reported \nhis health and security clearance status. She praised his dedication and expertise as a \ncybersecurity administrator. His team-player performance was rewarded with a recent \npay increase. (Tr, 69-72, 121; AE G) There is no indication that Applicant self-reported \nhis THC use to the manager. \nIn a character reference dated April 2, 2024, a doctor and head of emergency \nmedical services of a hospital disclosed that he has been Applicant\u2019s friend for 20 years. \nThe doctor described his concern for Applicant\u2019s continued use of opioids to treat his \npain. He opined that THC seemed to be more effective in controlling his pain than the \nopioids. The doctor extols Applicant\u2019s stability and integrity.

The review, requested \nby Applicant\u2019s manager in January 2023, indicates that he provided outstanding support \nfor audits on certain projects, demonstrating his team-player attitude by temporarily \nundertaking an administrative position so a key monitoring service could continue to \nfunction. (Tr. 74; AE I)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision.  \nAnalysis \nThe SOR lists two allegations under Guideline H. They are: \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nGuideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the Director of \nNational Intelligence Memorandum (October 25, 2014), Adherence to Federal Laws \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProhibiting Marijuana Use, which clearly emphasizes that state laws do not authorize \npersons to violate federal laws, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It highlights that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Disregard of federal law relevant to marijuana use (including \nprior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but not determinative to \nadjudications of security clearance eligibility. Agencies are required to employ the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of THC/CBD meet the definitions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). In order to use the drug, he had to possess it, and he purchased the drug in \nvarious forms on at least a couple of occasions as defined by AG \u00b6 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(f) \napplies because he started using marijuana in August 2021, after he was granted a \nsecurity clearance or a sensitive position in 2016. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of THC did not stop until August 2023. His use throughout the \nperiod of August 2021 through August 2023 cannot be characterized as infrequent or \nsporadic. However, attempting to alleviate his hip pain, multiple surgical and nerve \nprocedures were performed between December 2020 and 2023, with little success. \nApplicant was prescribed numerous medications that seemed to do nothing more than \nmask the continuing pain. He is confident that the hip replacement scheduled for April \n18, 2024, will eliminate his pain altogether. \nFor about a year before his first hip surgery in December 2020, Applicant had \nbeen experiencing acute hip pain when he walked or jogged. Two months after the \nsurgery, his hip pain, which moderated for a time, became more intense. A pain \nspecialist, based on the comments from his other patients who achieved relief from the \nTHC/CBD oils, indicated to Applicant that it was okay to use hemp products for \nmedicinal purposes under medical supervision, even with his security clearance. \nApplicant resumed using THC products in August 2021 when he could not sleep \nbecause of the pain. In June 2022, he voluntarily reported his THC use on his security \nclearance application. He stated his intention to use some form of the drug in the future \nbecause he mistakenly believed that his use was lawful since he had a medical \nmarijuana card, and he was using the drug under medical supervision. \nBecause of persistent pain, Applicant had a second arthroscopy performed on \nhis hip in September 2022. The hip pain decreased to a level where Applicant \nconcluded that he could discontinue the drug altogether in December 2022. However, \nthe hip pain returned. \nDr. AB, who had been treating Applicant throughout 2023 and the early part of \n2024, reinforced Applicant\u2019s mistaken belief that he could continue low-dose THC use \neven though the drug continued to be against the Federal law. Based on Applicant\u2019s \noverriding concern to comply with Federal law prohibiting THC use and to continue his \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfuture employability, he discontinued THC use in August 2023 and resumed opioid use \nwith an eye towards surgery on April 18, 2024. I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s THC \nuse occurred under unusual circumstances that he will not repeat in the future. \nPrior to his use of hemp-based products between August 2021 and August \n2023, Applicant\u2019s last involvement with THC or any other illegal drugs, was a one-time \nuse eight years ago in 2013. He disclosed that use in his June 2022 e-QIP. Other than \nhis infrequent purchases of hemp-based products from dispensaries, he has never \nassociated with drug users due to his abiding concern to preserve his security \nclearance. He was candid in his admissions of his THC/CBD use in his June 2022 e-\nQIP and at the hearing in April 2024. He stated his intention to use the drug in the future \nbecause his use of the drug was under medical supervision, and he had a marijuana \ncard. His signed statement of intent signifies his understanding that all THC/CBD use, \nas well as other drug use, is against federal law. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that she may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwilling to comply with \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\u2026\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana between August 2021 and August 2022 while \nbeing granted access to classified information or employment in a sensitive position, his \nintention in June 2022 to continue future use, and his purchase of hemp-based products \nfrom August 2021 to at least August 2022, is fully covered under Guideline H. His \nconduct under Guideline E simply reiterates the Applicant\u2019s behavior under Guideline H. \nSignificantly, there is no adverse behavior by Applicant to infer or suggest that he \nintentionally falsified his illegal drug use during any phase of the security clearance \ninvestigation. He was forthcoming about his THC/CBD use in his June 2022 e-QIP, and \nsince that time. The personal conduct guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for drug involvement in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has a 17-year-old daughter and intends to marry \nhis fianc\u00e9. He has been employed by his company since 2017, and his character \nevidence shows that his team player attitude has translated well at work. \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nAbout a year before his first hip operation in December 2020, Applicant had \nexcruciating hip pain that interfered with his sleep and his work. As the medical records \nreveal, he has been prescribed a laundry list of medications and surgical procedures on \nhis hip and nerves controlling the area. The medications have done little to alleviate his \npain. At the April 2024 hearing, he was still experiencing intermittent pain. \nApplicant\u2019s use of THC/CBD, especially after being granted a security \nclearance in 2016, displayed poor judgment. However, he was searching for an answer \nto his pain. He mistakenly thought that he was allowed to use the THC/CBD because it \nwas permitted under state law and medical supervision. Applicant is not a drug user and \nhas signed a statement of intent to forego illegal THC/CBD use in the future, \nunderstanding that future drug involvement will be grounds for revocation of his security \nclearance eligibility. He has mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct \nguidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He viewed online pornography on his personal devices for 30-60 minutes \nmost days through high school and college. In early 2021, he installed software to block \nhis access to pornography on his home computers because he was getting married and \nthought it would be wrong to continue viewing pornography online and because it was \ncontrary to his religious beliefs. In about October 2021, he was using his company-issued \ncomputer to search an authorized file-sharing website, noticed an adult category, and first \naccessed pornography on his work computer. He was not looking for pornography, but \n\u201cmade the choice to pursue [pornography] when the opportunity presented itself.\u201d (Id.)

(Answer; Tr. 39) He has met with a counselor for about two hours a \nweek since. After he received the SOR, he talked with his pastor and learned his church \nhad a support group for men who have faced similar sexual addictions. He joined the \nsupport group in late February 2023 and has attended weekly meetings since. He \nbelieves he has been forthright and cooperative with others in his recovery, found support, \nencouragement and accountability for himself and others, gained insights into his \naddiction and the discipline needed to break it, and has not displayed indications he would \nimproperly use a company\u2019s IT system again. He has not used a computer issued by his \ncurrent employer to access pornography online. (Answer; AE G; Tr. 26-32, 38-43, 59-63) \nApplicant estimated he has viewed pornography online less than 10 times since \nAugust 2022. He said he last viewed pornography online in July 2023, and that he looked \nat sexual material \u201che wouldn\u2019t want to look at . . . shortly before Thanksgiving [2023].\u201d \n(Tr. 62-63) He said \u201c[i]t hasn\u2019t been a perfect recovery\u201d, and that he has disclosed his \nrelapses to his wife, counselor, and support group. (Tr. 63) He stated: \n[He and his wife have] gotten more software since then . . . to kind of close \nthe loopholes. And that\u2019s been pretty effective. \nAny lapses, I would say the July and the Thanksgiving lapse, were because \nof . . . . we've had to bring the [software] down to add a website to the \nwhitelist, and either we forget about it, or we set it correctly (sic), and a \nlapse happens. And then I tell [my wife] a lapse happened, and tell my group \na lapse happened, and we'll get things fixed back up. \n[When asked if he felt a strong impulse to view pornography if the blocking \nsoftware was not in place \u2013 Applicant responded] Not always. There have \nbeen several times where the filters have been down and I've said, hey, we \nneed to bring these back up. (Tr. 70-71) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified they worked through some difficult issues regarding his \nurges that has strengthened them, improved accountability, intimacy, and honesty. She \nsaid he has faithfully attended individual counseling and group sessions and spends \nhours doing his homework. Before they were married Applicant informed her that he \nstruggled with a pornography addiction, and he installed accountability software in about \nFebruary 2021. She learned he relapsed when he lost his job in August 2022. He sought \nand has seen trained and certified but unlicensed counselors through their church, and \nshe has seen a lot of growth.

They \ndescribed him as reliable, a good worker who adheres to rules applicable to handling \nclassified information, and neither had concerns about him having a security clearance. \n(Tr. 104-128) His appraisal from Company B for 2022 was successful overall. (AE A) \nThe facilitator for the faith-based support group for men struggling with sexual \naddiction testified Applicant had attended weekly group meetings since about March \n2023.

The witness, a former Army Chaplain and \ncurrent defense contractor with a security clearance, said he had no concerns with \nApplicant being granted access to classified information. (Tr. 128-139) \nApplicant\u2019s pastor noted Applicant had shared his situation at work, took the \ninitiative to seek help and strongly desired to overcome the challenge he has faced since \nbeing exposed to pornography at a young age. He described Applicant as receptive to \naccountability, noted he joined a men\u2019s group to address this topic, and that Applicant \nhad been honest and shown significant success in facing this challenge.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted use of a company-issued computer to access adult websites \nin violation of Company A\u2019s AUF raises the following security concern under AG \u00b6 40: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good\u00adfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions.  \nAG \u00b6 41(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s admission he misused a company-\nissued computer when questioned in August 2022, the lack of recurrence since, \ndisclosures to his wife, and continued participation in faith-based counseling and group \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsessions are positive developments. These actions evidence his commitment to gaining \ninsight into and better controlling his desire to view pornography online and to prevent \nrecurrence. However, his interest in viewing pornography online, albeit apparently \nreduced, is long-standing, and his misuse of a company-owned computer to do so in \nAugust 2022 is relatively recent. Since Applicant was fired for his computer misuse, he \nhas legally viewed pornography on his personal computer on multiple occasions by \nexploiting gaps in software he installed for the express purpose of preventing him from \ndoing so as recently as July 2023. He also viewed sexual material \u201che wouldn\u2019t want to \nlook at\u201d after he received notice of the date his security clearance hearing was scheduled. \nThe evidence is insufficient to conclude his unauthorized use of an IT system happened \nunder unusual circumstances or is unlikely to recur. His behavior casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 41(b) through 41(d) do not apply. Applicant misused a company-issued \ncomputer to view pornography online numerous times over a period of 10 months, and \nalmost daily from about April 2022 until August 2022. His misuse was intentional, for \npersonal reasons, with knowledge it was prohibited by his employer, and only stopped \nwhen his employer discovered his misuse and terminated his employment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline M in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nemployment history, counseling and participation in a support group, and the strong \nsupport from his wife, counselors, and supervisors. I also found Applicant to be credible \nand sincere. \nI weighed these factors against his extended and relatively recent unauthorized \nuse of a company-issued computer to access pornography and resulting termination of \nhis employment, his apparently reduced but continuing interest in viewing pornography \nonline including his exploitation of vulnerabilities in software he installed on his home \n7 \n\n \ncomputer to prevent him from doing so. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under his current \ncircumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline M and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his unauthorized use of an IT system. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

One of \nthese sailors was a woman he had been casually dating but they had not previously had \nsexual relations. She later told investigators that she and Applicant were intoxicated that \nnight and participated in consensual kissing. He then attempted to have her touch him. \nShe pushed him away and told him she wanted to go to sleep. She later woke up naked \nand felt that she had been penetrated. She reported the event and the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS) initiated an investigation. (GX 13-15; Tr. 24-25, 53-61) \nApplicant submitted a voluntarily sworn statement to NCIS in which he claimed that \nneither the woman nor he was intoxicated at the time and that they were both awake \nduring their consensual sexual relations. However, when further questioned by \ninvestigators, he stated that he underestimated the amount of alcohol that they had \nconsumed and provided contradictory statements on the extent that she was awake or \nasleep during sex. Applicant was charged with sexual assault (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The charges \nwere dismissed in June 2001, following an Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ) hearing. He testified that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d that the event occurred and that he \nnever should have put himself in that situation.

In the years that followed, he served on multiple ships and deployed \nduring Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. In 2010, Applicant was promoted to E-6. \n(GX 1; Tr. 25-20, 50-53) \nIn August 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife gave birth to their second child and went on \nmaternity leave. Shortly afterwards, Applicant began to have health issues and was later \ndiagnosed with cancer. In order to assist with his treatment and recovery, his wife did not \nreturn to work. After treatment, he was placed on limited duty and there was discussion \nof processing him for medical retirement. However, he successfully stayed in the Navy. \nIn 2013, he returned to active duty, but did not immediately return to a ship. This reduced \nhis income because of the loss of sea pay and family separation allowance. (GX 1; \nTr. 29-34) \nUnable to maintain his finances, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April \n2015. He estimated that about $20,000 of debt, primarily relating to credit cards, was \nincluded in the bankruptcy which was discharged in August 2015. (SOR \u00b6 4.f) Applicant \ntestified, that following the bankruptcy, he was able to get his finances back into good \nstanding. (Answer; GX 16-18; Tr. 29-36) \nBy 2016, Applicant was again serving on a ship as an E-6. At the time, he was 35 \nyears old. One night in May 2016, he and several sailors enjoyed an evening out where \nthey consumed alcohol. While out, he met a female sailor who was an E-4 and in her \nearly 20s. They walked back to the ship together. She knew that he had mentored other \nsailors on board and felt comfortable talking with him. (Answer; GX 6-7; Tr. 72-85) \nOnce on board, he took her to an isolated section of the ship. She later reported \nto NCIS investigators that he started to kiss her and she initially \u201cwent along with it.\u201d He \nthen proceeded to place his hand inside the backside of her jeans and then slid his hand \naround to her front near her pubic area. At that point, she stated that she \u201crealized what \nwas happening\u201d and pulled his arm out of her pants, pushed him away and exited the \nroom. (GX 6) \nApplicant was subsequently charged with violation of UCMJ Article 120(d) \u2013 \nAbusive Sexual Contact. In his Answer, Applicant admitted \u201cto engaging in a consensual \nintimate kissing incident that my accuser initiated and escalated,\u201d and that \u201cI maintain my \ninnocence addressing this allegation.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Answer; GX 6-7, GX 12; Tr. 72-85) \nWhile that matter was under review, in September 2016, Applicant intentionally \nviewed pornographic images on his government computer. He was aware that this was \nagainst regulations. Although he did not go directly to pornographic websites, he \ndescribed using a search engine to preview the explicit images. His activity was \ndiscovered and he was charged with violation of UCMJ Article 92 \u2013 Failure to Obey Order \nor Regulation.

(GX 6-8; GX 12; 81-86) \nApplicant testified that by 2017, he was experiencing a lack of intimacy with his \nwife and began looking at pornography with increasing frequency. He also began \ndownloading pictures and imagery onto his cellphone through peer-to-peer networks \nwhich provided no preview of the file until downloaded and opened. He testified that he \ncame across his first image of child pornography \u201cby accident\u201d through one of these \ndownloads. (Tr. 92) At first, he deleted the images. However, over time, he submitted \nsearch terms that he knew would lead to the download of child pornography.

Several images of suspected child pornography were found on his cell phone, \nand he admitted to possessing child pornography. He was charged with violations of 18 \nU.S. Code \u00b6 2252 \u2013 Production, Distribution, and Possession of Child Pornography and \nUCMJ Article 134 \u2013 Possessing, Receiving or Viewing Child Pornography.

He was released in July 2022 and required to register with State B, his \ncurrent state of residence, as a sex offender. With that registration, he is restricted from \nliving near parks and schools, lost his right to vote and is prohibited from owning a firearm. \nHe must also report any email address he uses to State B. He believes he is required to \nstay registered as a sex offender through 2029. He stated that his family, friends and \nemployer are aware of the circumstances surrounding his confinement and discharge. \n(GX 5; Tr. 38-47, 103-107) \nApplicant continued to participate in counseling after his release with his family\u2019s \ntherapist through mid-2023 when he no longer found it to be beneficial.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 described conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nIn 2001, Applicant was charged with committing sexual assault on an intoxicated \nfemale sailor. Although he provided inconsistent statements to investigators at the time, \nthose charges were eventually dismissed. In 2017, he received nonjudicial punishment \nfor abusive sexual contact upon a female sailor of a lower rank onboard ship and for \nviewing pornography on his government computer. \nBeginning in 2017 through his arrest in 2020, Applicant also viewed child \npornography on his cell phone. Under Guideline D, the security concern over sexual \nbehavior \u201cincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission.\u201d I find that Applicant\u2019s downloading and accessing sexually explicit images \nof children satisfies this definition. I find that Applicant\u2019s conduct in all of these instances \nreflects a serious lack of judgment and that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), \nand 13(d) apply. \nAG \u00b6 14 describes potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual conduct, \nincluding: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nOver the course of his Navy career, Applicant was twice charged with sexual \nassault and received nonjudicial punishment on one occasion. Although he expressed \nremorse over his actions, he still contests that he did anything wrong and believes that \nboth charges arose from consensual sexual actions that he and his partner took at the \ntime. However, he has not established that those interactions were strictly private, \nconsensual and discreet. AG \u00b6 14 (d) does not apply. \nAdditionally, Applicant viewed pornography on a government computer in 2016. \nMost significantly, he downloaded and viewed child pornography from sometime in 2017 \nuntil about May 2020. It cannot be said that his actions were infrequent or occurred long \nago. Additionally, he remains registered with State B as a sex offender, indicating that \nState B authorities do not trust him to be out in society without restrictions. AG \u00b6 14(b) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant testified that he attended counseling sessions while in confinement and \ncontinued with a family counselor after his release. He described the benefits of those \nsessions, but did not provide any treatment records. It is unclear from the record whether \nhe has demonstrated ongoing compliance with a treatment plan or received a favorable \nprognosis from a qualified mental health provider. AG \u00b6 14 (e) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s actions put him in a position where he might have been subject to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. As he notes, however, his family, friends and employer \nare aware of the circumstances leading up to his arrest and confinement. His registration \nwith State B as a sex offender is also a matter of public record. Therefore, AG \u00b6 14(c) has \nsome application. However, insufficient time has passed to establish that Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior is solely in his past. The Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 31.

At \na General Court-Martial in September 2021, he was convicted under UCMJ Article 134 \u2013 \nPossessing, Receiving or Viewing Child Pornography. As a result of his criminal activity, \nhe received a bad conduct discharge from the Navy. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), \nand 31(e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes potentially applicable mitigating conditions for criminal conduct, \nincluding: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nOver the course of his Navy career, Applicant was twice charged with sexual \nassault and received nonjudicial punishment on one occasion. As recently as May 2020, \nhe was in possession of child pornography. While in confinement and afterwards, he has \nexpressed remorse over his past actions, attended counseling and stated his focus on \nregaining the trust of those around him. There is some recent evidence of rehabilitation. \nHowever, Applicant has shown over time, and most recently with his possession \nof child pornography, a pattern of extremely poor judgment. Insufficient time has passed \nto establish that the rehabilitation has been successful and that Applicant\u2019s past actions \nno longer raise questions as to his reliability, trustworthiness or judgment. Neither \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) nor 32(d) applies. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 40. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nIn 2016, Applicant used his government computer to access and view \npornography. From 2017 through his arrest in May 2020, he used his cell phone network \nto perform a criminal act by downloading child pornography. Disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 41 describes potentially applicable mitigating conditions for the misuse of \ninformation technology including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s viewing of pornography on his government computer occurred during \na limited period eight years ago. His actions were discovered, he admitted his error and \ndid not further attempt to view pornography on a government or work computer. However, \nrather than establish that this was an unusual circumstance or singular error in judgment, \nhe proceeded to download and view child pornography over his cell phone network over \nthe next three years until his arrest in May 2020. Similar to the reasons discussed under \nGuideline D and Guideline J, insufficient time has passed to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) \ndoes not apply.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nIn 2015, after several years of financial difficulties, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Recently, he has again experienced financial difficulties largely related to his \nconfinement and loss of military benefits following his bad conduct discharge. Recent \ncredit reports show accounts in delinquent status. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes potentially applicable mitigating conditions for the financial \nsecurity concerns including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s wife left her employment to give birth to their second child. \nShortly afterwards, Applicant was diagnosed with cancer which severely impacted his \nfamily\u2019s financial circumstances leading to his filing for bankruptcy in 2015. These were \ncircumstances largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control and, for a period following the \nbankruptcy, he was able to maintain his finances in good standing. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 4.f. \nRecently though, Applicant is again maintaining several delinquent accounts. \nUnlike the previously unforeseen events, his current financial difficulties are the direct \nresult of his criminal activity, confinement and loss of military benefits following his bad \nconduct discharge. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) nor 20(b) is applicable to the remaining debts \nalleged in the SOR. \nApplicant further testified that he was communicating with creditors and paying on \nseveral of his delinquent debts. However, the record only reflects that he has paid or \notherwise resolved the debts associated with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.e. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.e. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b, 4.c and 4.d remain unresolved. \nSince returning to employment in September 2022, Applicant has resolved some \ndebts and not experienced any new delinquent debts. However, he has not yet \nestablished a sufficient track record of payments to mitigate the ongoing financial security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J, M and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOver the course of his military career, Applicant served on multiple ships and \ndeployments and stated his desire to continue to serve his country. However, he has also \nmade several choices reflective of extremely poor judgment. During his hearing, Applicant \nadmitted to hitting \u201crock bottom\u201d while in confinement. He appeared remorseful over his \npast actions and stated his desire to rebuild his family and career. Still, he was twice \ncharged with sexual assault including one charge that resulted in nonjudicial punishment. \nEven more distressing, he downloaded and viewed child pornography for a period of \nabout three years and as recently as May 2020, which resulted in his trial and conviction \nby General Court-Martial. \nThe frequency, recency, and severity of Applicant\u2019s actions leave me with \nquestions and doubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \ndid not mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.b-4.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.e-4.f: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, both factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. as amended, and \u00b6 1.b.), but denied the allegations under personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as the co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) with his current employer providing cybersecurity and digital services since 2021.

On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories, and also asked him to verify the accuracy of \nan investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. He responded to those interrogatories and \nverified the summary on December 19, 2022. On December 30, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 27, 2023, but re-formatted on February 9, \n2023, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on March 30, 2023. The case was assigned to me on September 11, 2023. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on January 18, 2024, scheduling the hearing for February \n12, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE G were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \nand two witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 23, 2024. I kept \nthe record open to enable the parties to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted additional documents, which were marked and admitted, \nwithout objection (AE H through AE M). The record closed on February 26, 2024. \nRulings in Procedure \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel made a Motion to Amend the SOR by \ndeleting the words \u201cwhile granted access to classified information\u201d in subparagraph 1.a. \nand substituting therefore the words \u201cwhile holding a sensitive position.\u201d There being no \nobjection, the Motion was granted. (Tr. at 9-10) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, both factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. as \namended, and \u00b6 1.b.), but denied the allegations under personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \nand 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas the co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) with his current employer providing \ncybersecurity and digital services since 2021. He was previously employed by various \nemployers in a variety of positions, including vice president (February 2019 \u2013 June 2021); \ndirector (June 2016 \u2013 January 2019); and senior technical advisor (September 2009 \u2013 \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJune 2016). A 2000 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. He \nwas commissioned into the U.S. Army in August 2004 and served on active duty until \nJanuary 2009, when he was honorably discharged as a captain (O-3). He transitioned \ninto the U.S. Army Reserve and served in the active reserve until he was honorably \ndischarged in November 2011. In June 2010, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) awarded him a ten percent disability rating for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \neffective January 27, 2009. (AE J) He was granted a secret clearance in 2004. He was \nmarried in 2011. He has a stepson born in 2000 and a daughter born in 2013. \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his military service, including two deployments to Iraq (July 2005 \u2013 July \n2006, and September 2007 \u2013 October 2008), Applicant was awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service \nRibbon (two awards), the Iraq Campaign Medal (two awards), and the parachutist badge. \n(AE L) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges the following: \n1.a. From about September 2009 until at least November 2022, you \nused marijuana with varying frequency, including use while holding a \nsensitive position. You intend to continue to use marijuana in the future. \n1.b. In about September 2009, you were charged with Possession of \nMarijuana. \nIn his April 2022 SF 86, Applicant reported that in September 2009, he was \ncharged with possession of under .5 grams of marijuana. In November 2009, the charge \nended in a Nolle Prosequi, and the charge was subsequently expunged from the state \njudiciary case research system. (See AE A at 1; AE B; Tr. at 39-41) He noted that he had \ndocumented PTSD and the marijuana was helping him cope with the graphic memories \nof the deaths of some comrades during his deployment during Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe also reported that his estimated first use of marijuana occurred in September 2009 \nand his estimated most recent use occurred in April 2022. He contended that marijuana \nhelps him cope with the memories of certain traumatic events, and when he uses it, it is \na very small amount, mostly to help him get to sleep. He inhales marijuana sometimes \nonce a week, and sometimes two to three times per week, or some weeks or months \nwithout doing so, depending on when the memories of the traumatic events are most \nprevalent. He acknowledged that as part of the state court process, the judge \n\u201cencouraged\u201d him to join a marijuana substance abuse group counseling in September \n2009. Applicant reported that after about two months in the program, the program \ncounselor understood why he used marijuana and his participation in the group was no \nlonger necessary.

Applicant stated that when he was arrested for \npossession of marijuana, he spent the night in jail, and with the assistance of an attorney, \nas part of a plea agreement, he was given probation before judgment and agreed to one \nyear of drug education and testing. He acknowledged sporadic use of marijuana \nsometimes once a week, and sometimes two to three times per week, or some weeks or \nmonths without doing so. He never mentioned that there were periods longer than a few \nmonths when he had not used marijuana. He acknowledged that after four months in the \nprogram \u2013 not merely two months as he had previously stated \u2013 he was released from it. \nApplicant stated that although he does not intend for this type of event to occur again, he \nacknowledged that there was the potential for further marijuana use in the future to \nalleviate his PTSD issues. He has not made any attempts to stop or reduce his use of \nmarijuana, and he continues to use it to deal with his PTSD. He added that other than the \nfriends who \u201cfreely\u201d provide him with marijuana for medicinal purposes (not prescribed for \nhim), he does not associate with people involved in criminal activities. (GE 3 at 6) \nIn his response to interrogatories following his OPM interview, Applicant admitted \npurchasing less than 1 gram of marijuana from a public dispensary on September 13, \n2022, and that he had continued to use marijuana with the most recent use taking place \non November 5, 2022, claiming it was the 15th  anniversary of his traumatic incident. (GE \n3 at 10-12)  \nSince the summer of 2017, through as recently as the week of the hearing, \nApplicant has been a patient of a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)/psychotherapist \nwhose specialty is couples\u2019 counseling therapy. Although she claims in her report to be \ntreating him for PTSD, her qualifications do not reflect any such specialty, and her report \ndoes not indicate any reference to treatment for substance abuse regarding marijuana. \nDuring her testimony she acknowledged that the nature of the therapy never changed \nfrom couples therapy to other therapy. (AE D; Tr. at 99-102) Applicant considered the \ncounseling to be marital counseling. She did not administer any tests, never reviewed any \nmedical records and did not consider his use of marijuana to be an issue of her concern. \nWhile not discussing his use of marijuana, she opined that he is a highly functioning, \ncaring and supportive member of his family, is an active and productive member of \nsociety, and has \u201ca willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AE A; AE D; \nTr. at 86) \nOn February 1, 2024, in response to Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s request for a \npsychological evaluation of Applicant, a Telehealth video connection facilitated by Zoom \nwas performed by a licensed clinical psychologist \u2013 a Ph.D. \u2013 for over two hours. In \naddition to an interview, Applicant was administered the 335 question Minnesota \nMultiphasic Personality Inventory \u2013 3 (MMPI-3) questionnaire. Because Applicant was not \nconsidered to be a regular user of marijuana, the questioning never delved into the \nfrequency of his use. No medical records from the VA were reviewed. Based on his \nanalysis of the interview and test, the psychologist concluded that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with PTSD, in partial remission (F43.10), under the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Revised (DSM-5-TR), but that a diagnosis of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nCannabis Use Disorder (F12.10 and F12.20), DSM-5-TR, was ruled out. (AE G; Tr. at \n103-123) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified and added to, or seemingly modified, \nseveral of his former comments regarding his use of marijuana. He admitted that his most \nrecent use of marijuana took place on November 5, 2022 \u2013 approximately seven months \nafter he submitted his 2022 SF 86 \u2013 and approximately five months after he was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator. (Tr. at 63) In his Answer to the SOR, he had noted \nthat one of the traumatic incidents occurred on November 5, 2007. He now acknowledged \nthat November was a particularly sensitive month for his PTSD flare-ups because his \nbrother-in-law passed away with melanoma in November a decade earlier; and Veterans \nDay falls in November, and it brings things like the traumatic events in Iraq to the surface. \n(Tr. at 53-54) \nApplicant used marijuana less than a handful of times while in high school, as well \nas in April or May 2009 \u2013 use that he had previously not revealed. (Tr. at 64-65) Although \nhe had admitted using marijuana from about September 2009 until at least November \n2022, and had previously said in his 2022 SF 86 that he used it sometimes once a week, \nand sometimes two to three times per week, or some weeks or months without doing so, \nhe now stated that he had not used it for one entire year, between August 16, 2015, and \nAugust 16, 2016. (Tr. at 42-43, 48) Rather than mentioning abstinence for weeks or \nmonths as he had in the past, he now claims that he sometimes went for \u201cyears between \nuses.\u201d (Tr. at 49) In fact, he now denies using marijuana for four entire years from 2013 \nthrough 2016. (Tr. at 66) Applicant has never obtained a medical marijuana card. (Tr. at \n71) He knows that it is federally illegal to possess and use marijuana, but he continued to \nuse it after he was given a position of public trust in 2016. (Tr. at 72, 76-77)  \nApplicant submitted a statement and two proclamations associated with marijuana \nfrom President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., that he issued on October 6, 2022, and December \n22, 2023, respectively. In the statement, the President announced that he intended to \n\u201cpardon of all prior Federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana;\u201d was urging all \nGovernors to do the same with regard to state offenses; and he was seeking an \nadministrative process to review expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under federal \nlaw. (AE C) In his proclamation, of the same date, President Biden stated that he grants \na full and complete pardon to all current United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents who committed the offense of simple possession of marijuana in violation of the \nControlled Substances Act, on or before October 6, 2022. Those eligible applicants for \nsuch a pardon would have to apply for a pardon through the Attorney General. (AE E) \nThe additional pardon proclamation covered both the simple possession and the use of \nmarijuana. (AE F) Applicant argued that under the new policy as stated by President \nBiden, that because criminal records for marijuana possession have imposed needless \nbarriers to employment opportunities, and that we have a failed approach to marijuana, I \nshould \u201cright this wrong.\u201d (AE A at 1-2) Applicant never applied for a pardon under \nPresident Biden\u2019s policy.

(GE 2 at 17) In his Response to the \nSOR he denied intending to falsify his response and claimed that he was never convicted \nof any crime and that he simply miscalculated the period in question and thought that it \nhad occurred outside the seven-year period covered by the question. (AE A at 2) He \neffectively ignored having been arrested. \nWhen Applicant completed his 2016 SF 86, in response to a question in Section \n23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs: In the last year, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbiturates, \nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription \ndrugs?\u201d, he answered \u201cno.\u201d (GE 2 at 17) In his Response to the SOR, and during his \ntestimony, he denied intending to falsify his response and claimed, as stated above for \nthe first time during the processing of the investigation, that he denied using marijuana \nfor four entire years from 2013 through 2016, including the year before the inquiry. (Tr. at \n48) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase. . .; \n(f)  any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2004. In June 2010, the VA awarded \nhim a ten percent disability rating for PTSD, effective January 27, 2009. In September \n2009, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. Upon a plea \nagreement, the charge was Nolle Prosequi, and it was subsequently expunged from the \nstate judiciary case research system. Unbeknownst to his employers, he purchased \nmarijuana from a public dispensary on September 13, 2022, and from about September \n2009 until at least November 2022, to self-medicate for his PTSD, Applicant admittedly \nused marijuana with varying frequency, including use while holding a sensitive position. \nHis reported history of marijuana use has changed over time, and he initially admitted \nusing it sometimes once a week, and sometimes two to three times per week, or some \nweeks or months without doing so, and later stated that he had not used it for one entire \nyear, between August 16, 2015, and August 16, 2016. Rather than mentioning abstinence \nfor weeks or months as he had in the past, he claims that he sometimes went for \u201cyears \nbetween uses.\u201d He now denies using marijuana for four entire years from 2013 through \n2016. Because of the severity of his PTSD symptoms, he was previously unable to \ncommit to discontinue such misuse, but now claims that while he does not want to use \nmarijuana in the future, he acknowledged that there was the potential for further marijuana \nuse in the future to alleviate his PTSD issues. Such a statement fails to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(f), and 25(g) \nhave been established. \nApplicant argued that under the new policy as stated by President Biden, that \nbecause criminal records for marijuana possession have imposed needless barriers to \nemployment opportunities, and that we have a failed approach to marijuana, I should \n\u201cright this wrong.\u201d Applicant never applied for a pardon under President Biden\u2019s policy. \nFederal law regarding marijuana remains unchanged despite President Biden\u2019s declared \npolicy. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s struggles with PTSD are \nunfortunate. But he has offered no evidence to show efforts to be treated for PTSD \nintertwined with marijuana use by the VA or even his own therapist. Marital counseling is \nnot PTSD or substance abuse counseling, and while he claimed that he had completed \nfour months of a court-mandated substance abuse education and counseling program, \nhe failed to submit any documentation to verify such participation. Moreover, his licensed \nclinical psychologist was unaware of his history of marijuana use and because Applicant \nwas not considered to be a regular user of marijuana, the questioning never delved into \nthe frequency of his use. No medical records from the VA were reviewed. Thus, the \nclinical psychologist\u2019s conclusion with respect to marijuana lacks this important \ncorroborative basis. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s eventual candor in April 2022 in admitting some marijuana use \nis considered to be a positive factor, his last-minute alteration of the facts regarding the \nfrequency and recency of such use is disappointing. Applicant\u2019s PTSD purportedly arose \nin November because of certain identified activities. It was purportedly so bad that after \na multi-year period, he resorted to self-medication with marijuana in violation of federal \nlaw. He sought counseling. While he repeatedly attributed his use of marijuana to his \nPTSD, and because of those symptoms, he could not rule out using marijuana in the \nfuture. Now, he contends that those symptoms have not appeared for four entire years \nfrom 2013 through 2016. With that statement, his credibility has been severely \ndiminished. All of the above continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b616: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nMy discussions above related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are adopted herein. When Applicant completed his 2016 SF 86, he answered the \nquestions \u2013 one related to arrests, charges, or convictions for any criminal offenses; and \nthe other related to the use of illegal drugs within the last year \u2013 both with denials. While \nApplicant\u2019s explanation regarding the criminal arrest merely weeks before the period in \nquestion had expired can be understood as a mere miscalculation and not a deliberate \nfalsification or concealment of the truth, his new assertion regarding the claimed period \nof abstinence during 2015 \u2013 2016, and actually during the four-year period from 2013 \nthrough 2016, when compared with his other explanations associated with his substance \nmisuse, is not credible. \nComplete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified \ninformation is essential to make an accurate meaningful security clearance assessment \nand eligibility determination. Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance \ndetermination is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation\u2019s security. Applicant\u2019s \nactions lead me to conclude that at some point in August 2016 he was not candid; in April \n2022, he was partially candid; and in June 2022, he was more candid; but that his candor \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nhas subsequently diminished. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements describing his \nmarijuana use have significantly damaged his credibility. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s response to the 2016 SF 86 inquiry about arrests, \ncharges, or convictions for any offenses in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), I believe \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude that he intentionally falsified his response and \nAG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. However, with regard to Applicant\u2019s response to \nthe 2016 SF 86 inquiry about his use of illegal drugs within the last year (SOR \u00b6 2.b.), AG \n\u00b6 16(a) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the conditions apply. Although Applicant was admittedly regularly self-\nmedicating with marijuana since about September 2009 \u2013 at least 12 years before he \nreported such use in his 2022 SF 86, such a delay does not qualify as a \u201cprompt, good-\nfaith effort\u201d to correct his prior concealment of such use. It is unfortunate that he is afflicted \nwith PTSD from his service to the Nation. However, accepting his explanation that the \nhealth situation was so difficult for him that it led to self-medicating efforts with a \nsubstance that is illegal to possess and use under federal law; acknowledged use of \nmarijuana as recently as November 2022 \u2013 approximately five months after his OPM \ninterview \u2013 and an inability to promise no future use of marijuana, one cannot conclude \nthat the offense of concealing or falsifying the truth is minor, sufficient time has passed, \nthe behavior is infrequent, or that it is unlikely to recur. All of the above continues to cast \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 41-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as the co-founder and CEO with \nhis current employer providing cybersecurity and digital services since 2021. He was \npreviously employed by various employers in a variety of positions, including vice \npresident; director; and senior technical advisor. A 2000 high school graduate, he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. He was commissioned into the U.S. Army in August \n2004 and served on active duty until January 2009, when he was honorably discharged \nas a captain (O-3). He transitioned into the U.S. Army Reserve and served in the active \nreserve until he was honorably discharged in November 2011. In June 2010, the VA \nawarded him a ten percent disability rating for PTSD, effective January 27, 2009. He was \ngranted a secret clearance in 2004. During his military service, including two deployments \nto Iraq, he received several significant military decorations. In his most recent SF 86, he \nwas somewhat candid regarding his use of marijuana and anticipated future use. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2004. In September 2009, he was arrested \nand charged with possession of marijuana. Upon a plea agreement, the charge was Nolle \nProsequi, and it was subsequently expunged from the state judiciary case research \nsystem. From about September 2009 until at least November 2022, to self-medicate for \nhis PTSD, Applicant admittedly possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency, \nincluding use while holding a sensitive position. He purchased marijuana from a public \ndispensary on September 13, 2022. Applicant\u2019s reported history of marijuana use has \nchanged over time, and he initially admitted using it sometimes once a week, and \nsometimes two to three times per week, or some weeks or months without doing so, and \nlater stated that he had not used it for one entire year, between August 16, 2015, and \nAugust 16, 2016. Rather than mentioning abstinence for weeks or months as he had in \nthe past, he claims that he sometimes went for \u201cyears between uses.\u201d He now denies \nusing marijuana for four entire years from 2013 through 2016. He failed to honestly \nrespond to an SF 86 inquiry regarding his use of marijuana. Because of the severity of \nhis PTSD symptoms, he was previously unable to commit to discontinue such misuse, \nbut now claims that while he does not want to use marijuana in the future, he \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nacknowledged that there was the potential for further marijuana use in the future to \nalleviate his PTSD issues. Such a statement fails to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse, and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG \u00b6 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The DCSA \nCAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn March 13, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all the allegations \nexcept subparagraph 1.g, and requested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanother administrative judge on October 16, 2023.

That day, Department Counsel moved for a \ncontinuance after receiving a document one week before the hearing from Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. Applicant did not object, whereupon, the judge continued the case, rescheduling \nit for February 13, 2024. \nOn February 7, 2024, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR adding \nsubparagraph 2.d, cross-alleged under an additional paragraph (Guideline E, personal \nconduct) as subparagraph 3.a, as follows: \nYou failed to report or fully disclose, when required as an employee of \n[Company X], your foreign activities and associations with foreign persons. \nOn February 12, 2024, while the motion was pending, the hearing was rescheduled \nfor May 2, 2024. Later it was re-assigned to me. I held the hearing, as rescheduled. At the \nhearing, I granted the motion, and Applicant denied the additional allegation. I then \nconsidered seven Government exhibits (Government\u2019s Exhibit (GE) 1 \u2013 GE 7), and took \nadministrative notice of the facts encapsulated within one exhibit with seven attachments, \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, Attachment (Att.) 1 through Att. 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old married man with six children. Three of the children are \nadults and three are ages fourteen, seven, and three. (Tr. 50) Applicant has been married \ntwice previously. He has been married to his current spouse since 2018. (GE 1 at 33) The \nyoungest two children are from his current marriage. \nApplicant graduated from college in 1982, majoring in chemistry. (Tr. 82) He is a \nveteran of the Air Force National Guard, serving from 1980 to 2010. (Item 1 at 28) In 1990, \nhe completed officer candidate school and spent the remainder of his career serving as an \nofficer. He retired honorably. (Tr. 15, 82) Applicant has spent most of his civilian career \nworking for defense contractors. (Tr. 16) He has been working for his current employer in \nthe field of flight operations since 2021. (Tr. 15, 23) \nApplicant has approximately $81,000 of delinquent debt, as alleged in the SOR. The \ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, totaling $25,074, is a delinquent personal loan. Applicant \nborrowed this money to help him sustain his living expenses while he was unemployed in \n2016. (GE 2 at 3) It remains outstanding. The debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b through \n1.d, and 1.f, are delinquent credit card accounts that are owed to the same lender, totaling \napproximately $35,000. They have been charged off. There is no record evidence that \nApplicant has made any efforts to satisfy them. \nThe debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.e and 1.h, totaling approximately $11,000, are \nowed to the same creditor. Applicant contends that he has been satisfying these debts with \n$120 monthly payments since 2020.

Applicant contends that he was making \npayments towards the satisfaction of this debt until he lost his job in 2021. (GE 2 at 9-10) \nHe provided no substantiating evidence. \nApplicant owes the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i, totaling $254, to a credit union. \nHis contention that he paid it is unsupported by record evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Colombia. (Tr. 64) She has been living with \nApplicant in the United States since relocating from Colombia in late 2016. (Tr. 49) She is a \npermanent U.S. resident and is in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. ( GE 2 at 6; Tr. \n65) She is currently a homemaker and is studying to obtain a real estate license. (Tr. 75) \nApplicant and his current wife met in October 2015 and began dating shortly \nthereafter. (GE 2 at 5) When they met, he was still married to his second wife, but was \nestranged. He reported his relationship with his then-girlfriend to his employer in December \n2015 once it became serious. (GE 7 at 2) They later married. \nApplicant lived in Colombia when he was not performing a deployment rotation with \nhis company. (GE 6 at 3) He held a security clearance. (GE 7 at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s then-girlfriend owned an event planning business in Colombia. In early \n2016, Applicant borrowed $45,000, as referenced in subparagraph 1.a, to help her keep the \nbusiness afloat after a client failed to pay a bill. (Tr. 71) Applicant\u2019s efforts to help were \nultimately unsuccessful, as the business failed, prompting Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend to \nimmigrate to the United States to live with Applicant. (Tr. 71) \nBefore the company failed, Applicant, in February 2016, emailed the chief financial \nofficer (CFO) of his employer, asking him to consider investing between $700,000 and \n$1,000,000 in his then-girlfriend\u2019s company to help her satisfy debt, modernize, and \nexpand. (GE 6 at 3) In the email, he also noted that he had invested all the money that he \nhad available to help his then-girlfriend\u2019s company. (AE 7 at 7) Applicant also requested a \ndeployment to Colombia, stating that he needed the corresponding 15 percent pay increase \nbecause the divorce process was beginning with his second wife, and he needed as much \ncash as possible. (GE 7 at 6) At or about that time, Applicant also told another executive-\nlevel employee of the company that he was going to take a stakeholder position in a foreign \ncompany either as a chief executive officer or a board member, and he asked various other \nteam members to invest in his foreign venture. (GE 7 at 4) \nSubsequently, Applicant was terminated from employment in May 2016. (GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant remained unemployed for the next eight months through January 2017. This \ncompounded his financial problems, as discussed above. \nApplicant contends that his financial problems are under control. He keeps a budget. \nHe earns $220,000 annually. His contention that he has approximately $6,480 of monthly \ndiscretionary income is unsubstantiated.

(GE 2 \nat 7) Applicant has not visited him since returning to the United States. \nAdministrative Notice \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. The law provides citizens the ability \nto choose their government through free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot \nand based on nearly universal suffrage. (HE I, Att. 1 at 23) Colombia has close security ties \nwith the United States, including joint training, military assistance, and designation in 2022 \nas a Major Non-NATO Ally.(He I Att. 2 at 20) Significant human rights abuses remain \npervasive, particularly with respect to indigenous people, Afro-Columbians, and lesbian, \ngay, and transgender people. (HE I, Att. 1 at 1) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in deciding. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d   \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by a failed business venture \nrather than overspending, the nature of the investment was troubling, as he exhausted all \nhis credit helping his then-girlfriend, a foreign national whom he had just met two months \npreviously, mitigate a significant loss that her business incurred. He compounded this bad \ndecision by soliciting money from coworkers, including the company CFO, to invest in the \nbusiness. Under these circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nNotwithstanding how Applicant incurred these delinquencies, he contends that he \nhas arranged payment plans, and that he has been resolving them through monthly \npayments. He provided scant supporting evidence. Similarly, he provided no evidence \nsupporting his contention that he has a comfortable amount of monthly discretionary \nincome after his bills have been paid. Under these circumstances, none of the remaining \nmitigating conditions apply. I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThis guideline sets for the foreign influence security concern, as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial and property interest, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. (AG \u00b6 6) \nApplicant reported his relationship with his then-girlfriend in December 2015. \nAlthough he did not report this relationship until two months after he met her, he reported it \nnonetheless. As for his business association with her, the company was placed on notice of \nit when he attempted to solicit investments from the CFO and various coworkers. \nConsequently, I resolve subparagraph 2.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife, and his in-laws triggers the following \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(c) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with his wife and in-laws: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nWhen faced with the financial strain of an expensive divorce, Applicant leveraged his \nconnection with Colombia by touting a business opportunity to his coworkers involving his \nthen-girlfriend\u2019s business. Although Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend (current wife) now lives in the \nUnited States and no longer owns the business, the egregiousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct \nheightens the risk of coercion posed by both his wife and his remaining relatives in \nColombia, regardless of how often he stays in touch with them, and regardless of \nColombia\u2019s status as a strong U.S. ally.  Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nIn sum, Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence security concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) The allegation set forth in subparagraph 3.a is the same one cross-\nalleged in subparagraph 2.a. I resolve it in Applicant\u2019s favor for the same reason as set \nforth in my discussion of subparagraph 2.d, above. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept  \nIn reaching my conclusion, I considered the whole-person concept factors and they \ndo not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3:a  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since March of 2018. Applicant is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 at pages 7, 14 and 20,) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a.

After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since March of 2018. Applicant is unmarried, and \nhas no children. (GX 1 at pages 7, 14 and 20,) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of \nabout $33,000. He avers, credibly, that it is a fraudulent debt. Applicant filed a police \nreport in that regard, and hired an attorney to dispute its authenticity. As a result, it has \nbeen removed from Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page \n51 line 8, GXs 4 and 5, and AppX A at pages 1~6.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nNone of these conditions were established. Applicant\u2019s alleged past-due debt is \nthe result a fraud perpetrated against Applicant. Financial Considerations is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of working in the defense industry (AppX A at pages 10~22), and \nis respected by those who know him in the workplace and in his community (TR at page \n19 line 11 to page 24 line 9, and AppX A at pages 7~9). Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

(Tr. 40-50; \nSOR; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has experienced significant hardships over the past several years that \nhave contributed to her inability to pay her financial delinquencies. These hardships \nbegan in about 2017, when her husband was in jail, limiting his ability to contribute \nfinancially. She was involved in car accidents that were not her fault that totaled her \nvehicles in June 2019 and September 2019. In September 2022, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with cancer. Not only does her cancer treatment limit her ability to work, but \ndespite receiving some charitable assistance from the hospital, she pays a significant \namount out of pocket for treatment and medication. Her husband changes jobs frequently \nand, despite their trying to stay within a written budget, he spends beyond their means, \neven when she tries to block his access to bank accounts. Her husband has also had \nperiods of unemployment over the years of various durations. (Tr. 19, 24, 34-35, 37-40, \n49) \nApplicant plans to either hire a debt consolidation company to repay her debts or \nto file bankruptcy. She had a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney, but the credit report \nthat the attorney acquired did not list sufficient delinquent debts for the attorney to \nrecommend that she file bankruptcy. Other than this bankruptcy consultation, and the \nbelow-listed information regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i, she has been unable to make any \nother resolution efforts towards her SOR debts as she lacks the funds to do so. She \ndenied owing the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c, because she believes that her husband returned \nthe vehicle within seven-days of purchasing it. However, she could not recall whether the \nloan documents permitted such a return and provided no documents to that effect. While \nshe disputed the account with the credit reporting agencies, it remains on her credit report, \nand she cannot recall the result of the dispute. She believes that she paid the overdraft \nfees listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i in the amount of $428 but cannot recall when she paid it and has \nno documentation to corroborate payment. Despite the lack of corroborating evidence, I \nfound her to be credible, so I find that she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has 13 delinquent debts totaling about $44,000. Many of these debts \nhave been delinquent for several years. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAs Applicant testified, she believes she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, I find for her \nwith respect to that allegation. However, the remainder of her delinquent accounts are \nmore problematic. \nWhile acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose almost entirely due to \nextremely difficult circumstances that were beyond her control, she has not sufficiently \nresolved the vast majority of her SOR debts, and she does not seem to have sufficient \nincome to do so. Therefore, her financial issues are ongoing, and I do not find that they \nare unlikely to recur. Many of these debts have been delinquent for years, but she has \nonly paid one of the smaller debts, had one bankruptcy consultation with an eye towards \ntrying again, and an intent to possibly hire a debt consolidation company. These fairly \ninsignificant attempts to resolve her debts do not constitute acting responsibly or making \na good faith effort to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant disputed that she owed the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d because she returned \nthe vehicle within seven days of purchasing it. Without corroborating evidence that the \ncontract for the purchase of the vehicle permitted cancellation of the contract within seven \ndays of its execution, this claim is not a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebt. Her failure to provide a copy of the contract further diminishes her claim for \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I am highly sympathetic to the \nextremely difficult events that have befallen Applicant over the last several years. \nHowever, I am required to follow the Directive to determine security clearance eligibility, \nand I must resolve any doubts in favor of national security. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

At the \nhearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of 11 exhibits (GEs 1-11), which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit \n(AE A), which was admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June \n14, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated seven \ndelinquent consumer debts exceeding $67,000 and (b) beginning in 2016, started taking \nout cash advances on his credit cards to support his gambling habit. Allegedly, neither \nhis delinquent accounts nor his gambling habit have been fully resolved. \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested for multiple offenses \nbetween March 2008 and September 2017, to include (a) an arrest and charge for \ndriving under the influence (DUI) in March 2008, for which he was found guilty and \nsentenced to one year of probation, and ordered to attend a victim\u2019s panel and have an \nignition interlock installed in his vehicle, in addition to receiving an Article 15 Army \ndisciplinary action; (b) an arrest and charge of child endangerment (associated with \nalcohol consumption) as a part of an Army Article 15 disciplinary action; and (c) an \narrest and charge of domestic battery, assault with a deadly weapon and false \nimprisonment in September 2017. Allegedly, Applicant consumed alcohol immediately \nprior to the incident and arrests are covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c.. \nUnder Guideline I, Applicant allegedly was evaluated in May 2022 by a licensed \npsychologist and determined after a structured personality assessment and medical \nrecords review to meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild; Gambling Disorder, in \nearly remission and an unspecified Anxiety Disorder. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s exhibited \nsymptoms were considered by the evaluating psychologist to be harmful or potentially \nhazardous for which Applicant exhibited a pattern of avoidance and denial. \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred alcohol-related arrests and \ncharges cross-alleged under Guideline J; (b) experienced a relapse of alcohol use \nleading to daily drinking; and (c) received a psychological evaluation cross-alleged \nunder Guideline I that included an alcohol use disorder diagnosis. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed all of the SOR-listed debts are covered by a \ndebt management program. He claimed no recollection of the child endangerment and \nhas full custody of his children following his divorce.

Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant  married in November 2001 and divorced in August 2011. (GE 1; Tr. \n25) He has two children from this marriage (ages 18 and 22). (GE 1; Tr. 19)  He earned \na high school diploma in June 2001 and attended technical courses between March and \nJune 2003 without earning a diploma or degree. (GE 2) He reported brief \nunemployment following his divorce in 2011. Applicant enlisted in the Army in May 2001 \nand served 10-plus years of active duty before receiving an honorable discharge in \nSeptember 2011. (GE 1) \nSince 2022, Applicant has been conditionally employed (subject to his receipt of \na security clearance) as an aircraft worker for his current employer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23) \nHe was rehired and sponsored by his former employer with the understanding of \nwithholding actual employment pending his obtaining a security clearance. (Tr. 51-55) \nPreviously, he was an active-duty member of the U.S. Army. He held a security \nclearance while on active military duty. (Tr. 22) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2020 and 2021, Applicant accumulated seven delinquent consumer \ndebts exceeding $67,000. (GEs 1-4) The SOR-covered debts are listed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (a personal loan for $20,824); 1.b (a repossession charge-off for \n$19,093);.1.c ( a credit card account for $16,258); 1.d (a credit card account for \n$$4,515); 1.e (a credit card account for $4,028); and 1.f (a credit card account for \n$2,998) Applicant attributed his debt delinquencies to using his credit cards and cash \nadvances from a personal loan in 2020 to fund his gambling habit. (GE 11; Tr. 25) He \ndid not address these debts initially due to poor money management problems fostered \nby his alcohol and compulsive gambling addictions. (GE 11) \nAt the height of his gambling addiction (cresting in 2020), Applicant was spending \n$1,000 a week and producing little returns on his money. (Tr. 26)  Realizing he has a \nserious gambling problem, he self-referred himself to the VA in 2021 for counseling.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These AGs include conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n                   \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  .

AG \u00b6 21. \n    Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant cited alcohol and compulsive gambling following his 2017 breakup with \nhis fiancee as the principal sources of his accruing large delinquent debt balances. He \nhas avoided any breaks in employment since his divorce and has made some notable \nprogress \nin addressing his delinquent consumer debts. With the help of a debt \nresolution firm, he has been able to address and satisfy two judgment debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.e). And, he is credited with paying off the delinquent credit card account \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, his remaining three debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d \nand 1.f remain unresolved and outstanding. And, while he has made some noted \npsychological progress in reducing his gambling, he continues to gamble without a \nfavorable prognosis free of any recurrence risks. \nPartially available to Applicant due to his prior divorce and brief period of \nunemployment in 2011 is mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(b) of Guideline F. MC \u00b6 20(b) \nprovides as follows: \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances.\u201d Because Applicant\u2019s documented repayment initiatives remain a \nwork-in-progress, he cannot satisfy the \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d \nprong of \u00b6 20(b). So, too, application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is \nvery limited, given Applicant\u2019s remaining unpaid debts and his still unresolved gambling \nproblem. None of the other potentially available mitigating conditions are available to \nApplicant. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020).

See ISCR case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2019). \nBased on the evidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a \nsufficient tangible payment history of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board \nguidance associated with the good-faith and responsible payment requirements of MC \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and MC 20(d). While encouraging, Applicant\u2019s progress to date in satisfying his \ndebt delinquencies and resolving his gambling issues remain a work in progress. \nCriminal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are also raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple alcohol-related \ncharges emanating from domestic violence, child endangerment, and domestic battery \nreports. Applicable under the criminal conduct guideline is: DC \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests and charges attributable to \nhim without a sufficient track record of alcohol avoidance and assumed responsibility \nwith family members cannot be mitigated at this time. Applicant\u2019s historical arrest record \nis interrelated with the Government\u2019s alcohol concerns and cannot be evaluated in \nisolation of those concerns. \nPsychological and alcohol use concerns \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s diagnosed co-existing \ndisorders by an evaluating duly qualified mental health professional employed by the \nDoD: in Applicant\u2019s case Dr. A, a licensed clinical psychologist. Based on Dr. A\u2019s clinical \nreview, self-reported questionnaires, structured personality assessment, and medical \nrecords review, he found Applicant to meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild, \nGambling Disorder, in early remission, and an unspecified anxiety disorder. Besides \nfinding Applicant\u2019s alcohol use to be harmful or potentially hazardous (citing the World \nHealth Organization guidelines), Dr. A found Applicant to exhibit a pattern of avoidance \nand denial of symptoms or limited insight into the presence of his symptoms, and \nrecommended pursuing mental health treatment to better manage his anxiety \nsymptoms, as well as reengage his sobriety in light of his historical problems of alcohol \nuse. In his concluding psychological assessment of Applicant, Dr. A assessed \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to be not appropriately intact. \nApplicable disqualifying conditions under Guideline I consist of the following: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual \nhas a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d; and \n28(e), \u201cpathological gambling, the associated behaviors of which may include \nunsuccessful attempts to stop gambling; gambling for increasingly higher stakes, \nusually in an attempt to cover losses; concealing gambling losses; borrowing or stealing \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmoney to fund gambling or pay gambling debts; and family conflict resulting from \ngambling.\u201d Both DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nTo his credit, Applicant accepted Dr. A\u2019s. recommendations and enrolled in a VA \nmental health treatment program in 2023. His VA treatment records document regular \nindividual and group counseling sessions between February 2023 and April 2024. \nApplicant\u2019s initiatives entitle him to partial application of MC \u00b6 29(b)., \u201cthe individual has \nvoluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable \nto treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional.\u201d \nCo-existing security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple years of \nalcohol abuse (to the point of intoxication), interspersed with brief periods of abstinence \nand relapses. Treatment admissions covered outpatient sessions designed to promote \nhis recovery from diagnosed alcohol-abuse disorder. \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, four disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or \nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder\u201d; 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, \npsychiatrist, or licensed social worker) of alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(e), \u201cthe failure to \nfollow treatment advice once diagnosed\u201d; and 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is not \nin accordance with treatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder.\u201d \nRecognizing his mistakes in judgment associated with his recurrent periods of \nabusive drinking, even after receiving counseling and treatment for diagnosed alcohol \nabuse disorder, Applicant\u2019s abusive drinking is extenuated to some extent by the \nemotional reactions he experienced after his ex-financee, who cheated on him, left him. \nApplicant may take advantage of one of the mitigating conditions MCs of the alcohol \nconsumption guideline. MC \u00b6\u2019 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her pattern of \nmaladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d has some limited \napplication to Applicant\u2019s situation in this case. However, before Applicant can be \ncleared of relapse risks, both an updated diagnosis and prognosis are needed to clear \naway any doubts about the sustainability of his recovery. \nOffered an opportunity to provide medical updates from VA treatment counselors, \nApplicant provided considerable post-hearing documentation of his continuing \ncounseling and treatment of his diagnosed alcohol use and co-existing gambling and \nanxiety disorders. Without any evidence of continued counseling, sustained sobriety, or \ncessation of gambling, Applicant has no documented proof of his sustaining recovery \nfrom alcohol and gambling abuse to corroborate his rehabilitation claims.

At this time, \nthere is insufficient medical information in the compiled records of Applicant\u2019s referred \nmental health evaluator or VA to clear Applicant of potential recurrence risks based on \nthe evidence developed in the record to date. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether the state of his finances, criminal history, and co-existing \nmental health disorders are fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s problems in managing his finances and overcoming his \ndiagnosed gambling, psychological, and alcohol disorders remain security concerns. His \nco-existing disorders together have affected not only his ability to manage his finances \nsafely and responsibly, but \nhis ability to display the levels of judgment and \nresponsibility required to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security \nclearance. Taking into account his credited defense contributions and his recent \nrepayment and VA counseling initiatives, Applicant\u2019s progress to date in surmounting \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns, while encouraging, is insufficient and will need \nmore evidence of restorative efforts on Applicant\u2019s part. \nWithout a better track record of good-faith, responsible payment initiatives and \nrestorative alcohol and gambling progress, Applicant\u2019s overall efforts to date fall short \nof the levels of financial responsibility and established trust and reliability required for \neligibility to hold a security clearance, \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

On January 11, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on February 1, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 15 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 9, \n2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.l. He stated that he admitted SOR \u00b6 3.c, but his explanation amounts \nto a denial. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.e-1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 3.b, and 3.d. He did \nnot admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, or the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old maintenance helper employed by a defense contractor \nsince April 2022. He previously was employed in the private sector. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. He married in February 2018 and divorced in July 2021. He has a 10-\nyear-old daughter.

(Tr. \n28) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted being arrested, but at the hearing he denied \nthe underlying conduct. There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the \ncircumstances or disposition of these charges. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: April 2006, charged with failure to appear on a felony charge \n(alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant was charged with failure to appear in court to answer \nthe charge of making scratch marks on a neighbor\u2019s vehicle.

He testified, \u201cI always go to my \ncourt dates.\u201d (Tr. 29) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the \ndisposition of this charge. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: September 2007, charged with threatening a fast-food employee. \nApplicant was involved in an argument with a cashier at a fast-food restaurant. According \nto the cashier, Applicant threatened to shoot her if she came out from behind the cashier\u2019s \ncounter and to have his gang members come to the restaurant. Applicant denied this \nallegation in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing. (Tr. 31-32) The case was closed \nbecause the cashier would not cooperate in the police investigation. (GX 8)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: April 2009, charged with carrying a concealed weapon without a\npermit. \n \nPolice responded to a disturbance in which Applicant was involved.

Applicant was charged with assault and battery and brandishing a firearm. \nApplicant testified that he was with his brother when they were involved in an altercation \nas they were trying to protect their sister. He did not provide any further details. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he admitted that he was arrested. At the hearing, he admitted that he \nwas involved in an altercation but denied that he had a firearm with him during this \nincident. The charges against him were dismissed. (GX 12; GX 13; Tr. 43-47) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: November 2019, charged with assault and battery on a family \nmember. Applicant admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR. His then wife told \npolice that he had choked her and attempted to hit her with his car. He told a security \ninvestigator that he grabbed her by the shirt and pushed her against the car. (GX 2 at 6) \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied choking her, but admitted that he \u201cpoked\u201d at her. (Tr. 49) \nThe charges were dismissed after he completed a batterer intervention program. (GX 1 \nat 24; GX 14) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately May \n2015 to at least April 2022. Applicant denied this allegation in his answer to the SOR. \nWhen he was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2022, he admitted that he \nused marijuana five or six times between April and May 2022, at parties where it was \nsupplied by someone else and passed around. He told the investigator that he does not \nintend to use it again because he has a good job and does not want to lose it. He also \ntold the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use in his \u201ccase papers\u201d \nbecause he thought the question asked only about \u201cregular use.\u201d (GX 2 at 9) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA on May 5, 2022, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nasking if he had ever been charged with a felony and if he had ever been charged with \nan offense involving firearms. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking if he had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. At the hearing, \nhe testified that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions about felonies and firearms because \nthe charges in each case were dismissed, and he believed that if a charge is dismissed, \nit no longer exists. (Tr. 60)  \nApplicant testified that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question in his SCA about drugs \nor controlled substances because he had not used marijuana in the last seven years. (Tr. \n54) He denied telling a security investigator that he used marijuana in April and May 2022. \n(Tr. 51-53) When he responded to DOHA interrogatories in January 2023, he had the \nopportunity to review and correct the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview, but he did \nnot correct or object to the part of the investigator\u2019s summary that reflected his admission \nof marijuana use in April and May 2022. \nIn Applicant\u2019s closing statement, he admitted that he grew up and lived in a violent \nenvironment.

So if I can go out of town and see the reasons and stuff like that, \nmaybe I can grow and not going to be around all this stuff.\u201d (Tr. 79) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior was \nrecent. Although his two arrests in 1997 were a long time ago, they were the beginning \nof a long pattern of criminal conduct that continued until recently. The domestic violence \nincident was in November 2019 and his marijuana use was in April 2022. None of his \ncriminal conduct occurred under unusual circumstances. He presented no evidence of \nhis job performance.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission to the security investigator that he used marijuana in April \nand May 2022 establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was recent. It was \narguably \u201cinfrequent\u201d but it was consistent with his pattern of criminal conduct. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant acknowledged his marijuana use \nduring his security interview, but it is not clear whether he still associates with drug users \nor has changed his environment. He testified that he will not use marijuana again because \nhe wants to keep his job, but he has not provided the signed statement of intent set out \nin AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.-1.i. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, \nand 3.d allege falsification of the May 2022 SCA. The security concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition for the conduct cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a is: \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . : engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThis disqualifying condition is established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nevidence submitted at the hearing.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied intentionally failing to disclose that he \nwas charged with an offense involving firearms and his marijuana use during the last \nseven years preceding his SCA of May 2022. In his testimony, he admitted the underlying \nconduct underlying the firearms charge but denied that he was \u201ccharged,\u201d because he \nbelieved the charge no longer existed after it was dismissed. However, he admitted that \nhe deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use during the last seven years preceding \nhis May 2022 SCA. \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d is established by the evidence and is sufficient \nto establish the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct his falsification \nuntil he was questioned by a security investigator in June 2022. Even then, he falsely \nasserted that he thought the question in the SCA about drug use only applied to \u201cregular \nuse.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Although some of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct cross-\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a would qualify as \u201cminor,\u201d it was frequent, did not happen under \nunique circumstances, and was part of a long chain of criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification was recent, it did not occur under unique circumstances, and was not \u201cminor.\u201d \nFalsification of an SCA is a serious offense that \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his criminal conduct, drug involvement, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (Except the \nwords, \u201cfrom approximately May \n2015 to\u201d) \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k and 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b and 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) He admitted falsifying his answers during two interviews \nwith an authorized DoD investigator. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b) His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He attended college from 2015-2019 and obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in athletic training. He elected to find employment outside his field of \nstudy and was hired for jobs in security and cybersecurity. He held a variety of security \npositions from December 2019 through 2022, some simultaneously. He received a \nsecurity clearance in early 2019 and signed a nondisclosure agreement in September \n2020. In 2021, he worked for a company for three months but resigned in lieu of \ntermination over timecard issues. He worked for company Y as a security officer starting \nin October 2020, until he resigned from his position on April 20, 2022. He is single and \nhas no children. (GE 1; GE 4; Tr. at 19-22, 58-61.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: You failed a urinalysis test administrated by his employer, \n[company Y], on or about March 29, 2022, testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol \n(THC). Applicant admits failing the urinalysis but denies intentionally ingesting marijuana. \nHe states in his Answer he only learned he had ingested marijuana when he was alerted \nby his positive urinalysis test. \nCompany Y informed Applicant at 11:25 am on a Monday he was subject to a \nrandom urinalysis, and he had 24 hours to comply. The initial urine sample was found \noutside acceptable temperature range, which resulted in a retest. The second test was \npositive for marijuana. (GE 3 at 124; GE 4; GE 5 at 153, 155; Tr. at 70-71.) \nApplicant states he believes he ingested the marijuana while smoking a hookah \npipe, which he believed at the time to only contain tobacco. (Answer; Tr. at 41-44.) He \nprovided a flyer from the event where he believed he may have smoked marijuana from \nan infused hookah pipe. (AE X; Tr. at 94-99.) Applicant initially thought he may have \ntested positive because of a detox drink or a supplement he consumed as part of a \ntraining diet and was not supported by documentary evidence. (GE 4; Tr. at 23, 36-45, \n78-81, 74,100.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: Falsified material facts about his employment with company Y \nduring a May 6, 2022 interview with an authorized DoD investigator.

In a personal statement incorporated in his Answer he \nstates: \nMy comments regarding my employment with [company Y] were connected \nto my resignation in lieu of termination, to which I was afraid to admit. I was \noffered the opportunity to resign and avoid termination because of a positive \nrandom drug test while employed by [company Y]. I did not provide accurate \ninformation because I was embarrassed about my prior marijuana concerns \nand was foolishly afraid that it would create a stigma that would hurt my \nchances for employment. Since my resignation from [company Y], I have \ndone many things to try and rectify my mistakes. I have sought counseling \nacquired positive mentors and most important I am 100% drug-free and am \nwilling to be drug tested at any time. (Answer; AE D; AE G.) \nApplicant admitted during his testimony it was during the May 6 interview that he \nsaid \u201cyes\u201d when he was asked during his interview about currently working 14 hours a \nweek at company Y, despite having resigned from company Y about two weeks before, \non April 21, 2022. (GE 3 at 123-124; Tr. at 73.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: Falsified material facts about his employment with company Y \nduring a May 18, 2022 interview with an authorized DoD investigator when he \nfalsely stated that he would be eligible for rehire at company Y. Applicant in his \nAnswer admits this allegation. In his Answer he restated the same reason quoted above \nin the finds of fact for SOR \u00b6 2.a. He testified that he told the investigator that he had \nresigned to focus on his IT career and that he was eligible for rehire. He only admitted he \nwas not eligible for rehire because of his positive urinalysis after he was confronted by \nthe investigator. He described the matter as \u201ckind of a cut and dry type of thing.\u201d (GE 3 at \n123-124; Tr. at 63-64, 73-74; AE J.) \nWhole Person \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He continued to obtain training and \nprofessional certifications outside his academic degree. He also joined a professional \nbusiness organization, which provided mentorship and other professional development. \n(AE I; AE K; AE J.) His resum\u00e9 lists him holding a bachelor\u2019s in cybersecurity. His degree \nis in athletic training. (AE H; AE J; Tr. at 63-64.) He offered a number of character letters \nfrom people familiar with him in all facets of his personal history. (AE L through AE U) \nApplicant obtained some of the character references prior to the SOR being issued. He \nstates those persons whose letters precede the SOR were aware he had lied to the DoD \ninvestigator. (AE L; AE N; AE P; AE Q; AE R; Tr. at 83.) Several of these individuals \ntestified on his behalf. (AE L; AE M; AE S.) At least two witnesses were not aware that he \nhad lied to an investigator during his security clearance interview. One witness, who was \na senior law enforcement officer in Applicant\u2019s hometown, who was unaware of \nApplicant\u2019s lies to the DoD investigator, believed that with time Applicant could mitigate \nthe fact he had lied to an investigator.

(AE M; Tr. at 139-140, 151.) \nAs evidence of his commitment to drug-free living, Applicant pledged to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance abuse. He states: \n[I] wish to proudly and confidently state that I pledge to continue to remain \nfree from all illegal drugs, including marijuana, and refrain from any and all \nsubstance abuse. Furthermore, I fully acknowledge, understand, and \nembrace that any future involvement with drugs or misuse of the same will \nbe grounds for revocation of my security clearance and any national security \neligibility. (Answer; AE F.) \nApplicant stated he would disassociate from those who would use drugs and offered \nlaboratory reports from 2023 showing he had tested negative for marijuana. These \nincluded a negative hair follicle test conducted on June 19, 2023; and two negative urine \ntests, conducted on March 23, 2023, and April 15, 2023. To further demonstrate his \nseriousness for the situation, he met with a board certified doctor in addiction medicine to \nbe assessed for his risk for further drug use. (AE E; AE H; Tr. at 55, 91-92.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA and Answer are sufficient to raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence including, but not limited to:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant denies knowingly using marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility explaining the basis for the positive urinalysis casts doubt \non his current reliability and trustworthiness despite not having history of drug use or an \nincident since the positive urinalysis. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. While Applicant has taken action to 1) disassociate \nhimself from drug-using associates and contacts; 2) avoids environments where drugs \nmight be used; and 3) provided a signed statement of intent abstaining from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security he does not acknowledge his drug \ninvolvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nApplicant's deliberate falsifications to an investigator about his work status with \ncompany Y raises the following disqualifying condition, under AG \u00b6 16: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government Representative. \nThe following mitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 17, are potentially relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) are not established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Applicant \nadmitted he deliberately and repeatedly lied to the DoD investigator during the course of \ntwo interviews. The evidence reflects that he admitted his falsification to an investigator \nafter being confronted during the second security clearance interview. Applicant's false \nstatements concerning his employment status and eligibility for rehire with company Y \nare not \u201cminor,\u201d because such statements strike at the heart of the security clearance \nprocess. See ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). An applicant who \ndeliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection \nwith a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the \nindustrial security program. See ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \nApplicant's false statements were recent and calculated to give him the most favorable \nhiring profile for his application for a position requiring a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and have applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have carefully \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s attempts at self-improvement, the character evidence, the recency \nof his conduct, as well as the discrepancy in his resum\u00e9. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His \nadmissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the \npleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He graduated high school in 2004 and completed trade \nschool in 2019. He married in 2021 and has one minor child and two minor stepchildren. \nFrom January 2020 through February 2024, he worked as an airframe and powerplant \nmechanic for a government contractor. Applicant left his employment with the government \ncontractor about a month after the hearing concluded. (Tr. 15-17; GE 1; AE A, B, C) \nApplicant did not report any police involvement, alcohol related issues, or criminal \ncharges or convictions on his August 2021 SCA. Since he obtained his FAA certification \nin 2020, he has been subject to random testing for drugs and alcohol consumption at \nwork. (Tr. 58-64; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges the following under Guideline G (alcohol consumption): \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged in October 2009, Applicant was arrested for driving while \nimpaired (DWI) and was convicted. On the night of the arrest, he attended a social club \nmeeting and claimed to have only consumed three beers over a two-hour period. When \npulled over by police, he registered a .09% blood alcohol content on a breathalyzer. He \nwas sentenced to community service and had to pay a fine. His attorney fees were about \n$2,500. After his arrest, he had an alcohol assessment done, but does not recall the \nresults. He thinks he was told to abstain from alcohol but does not recall the instructions. \nHe did not have any alcohol counseling or treatment after this arrest. In 2013, he also \ncompleted a required DWI risk reduction program for this arrest. (Tr. 28-58; GE 2, 3; AE \nE) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged in January 2011, Applicant was arrested for DWI. He was found \nguilty and sentenced to confinement 12 months \u2013 suspended, 18 months of probation, \nand had to pay court-ordered fines and court costs. He reported that he was out with \nfriends that evening and claimed he drank about six beers over about a three-and-a-half-\nhour period. He claimed he did not feel impaired. He was stopped by police and failed the \nfield sobriety test. He pled guilty to the offense, spent seven days in jail and the rest of \nhis sentence was suspended. At his required alcohol assessment, he told the evaluator \nhe did not have a drinking problem. He does not recall if he was told to abstain from \nalcohol or to attend alcohol counseling.

(Tr. 28-58; GE 2, 3; AE F)     \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged in February 2012, Applicant was arrested for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI). He pled guilty and was sentenced to 10 days of \nconfinement, 12 months of probation, 240 hours of community service, and had to pay \ncourt-ordered fines. This arrest occurred while he was still on probation from the 2011 \nDWI arrest. He was out fishing with friends and drank about 10 beers. He admits that he \ndid not have a driver\u2019s license at that time and was driving while intoxicated. He reported \nit was raining, he lost control of the vehicle, hit a pole, and flipped his truck. He and his \ndog were injured, and it took two hours for rescue services to arrive, which he reported \nwas a terrifying experience. Police found empty beer cans in the vehicle. He had a \nconcussion, broken hand, and a head laceration. Since he had no insurance at the time, \nhis hospital bill was about $25,000. His attorney fees were about $10,000. (Tr. 28-64; GE \n2, 3) \nPrior to the 2012 DUI, Applicant reported drinking four or five times a week and \nto occasionally driving while intoxicated. After the 2012 DUI, he claimed that he abstained \nfrom alcohol for about four years. In 2012, he attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings daily for a year and identified himself as an alcoholic. In 2013, his attendance \nslowed down to once or twice a week, and he stopped attending in 2014. In late 2016, \nApplicant started consuming alcohol again. (Tr. 28-58) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged in May 2018, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He pled guilty and \nwas sentenced to 72 hours of confinement, 12 months of probation, 240 hours of \ncommunity service, and court-ordered fines. He was out with friends at a restaurant the \nnight of this arrest. He drank about four beers and drove himself and a friend home. He \nclaimed that he spaced out his drinking, drank water, and was not impaired when he drove \nhome. When stopped by police, he failed the field sobriety test. He refused a breathalyzer \nbecause he thought it would be harder to prove he was drinking and driving. He incurred \nmore attorney\u2019s fees for this incident. The court also ordered a drug and alcohol \nassessment after this arrest, and he was required to do a state-mandated alcohol \neducational course. The record shows that he did not report the full extent of his arrests \nor alcohol related problems to the evaluator. He did not have any alcohol counseling or \ntreatment after this arrest. (Tr. 29-64; GE 2, 3; AE D) \nIn 2019, Applicant was cited by police for a car accident. He was arrested and his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended. Criminal charges were dismissed when he was able to \nshow the court that he met his 2018 DUI sentence requirements. This incident was not \nalleged in the SOR but will be considered in the application of mitigating conditions. (Tr. \n29-58) \nApplicant reported he reduced his alcohol consumption after his last DUI arrest. \nHe admitted that he still consumes alcohol every few weeks, at home or out at dinner.

(Tr. 29-58) \nUnder Guideline J, SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged the Guideline G allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u00ad\n1.d, as criminal conduct concerns. \nWitness One oversees safety and security for Applicant\u2019s former employer, and he \nruns the alcohol and drug testing program. He reported that Applicant had not failed any \ndrug or alcohol testing, and he would have reported him if he had failed. He stated that \nApplicant is a good employe and has a skillset they need. (Tr. 68-82) \nWitness Two was Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor at his former employer. He had \nknown him about three years. He reported that Applicant\u2019s skills improved during this \nemployment. Applicant was trusted, dependable, and volunteered for assignments. \nApplicant had a good attitude and work ethic. He was unaware of Applicant\u2019s DUI\u2019s in the \nhiring process, but it would have been of concern if he knew. He did not recall seeing him \nconsume alcohol during the years they worked together. (Tr. 82-96) \nWitness Three was Applicant\u2019s wife. She reported that he drinks in moderation a \ncouple of times a month at home, and never drinks and drives. She has no concern about \nhim abusing alcohol or driving while intoxicated in the future. She never saw him drink to \nexcess, but also did not know him before 2019. She did not know he reported himself to \nbe an alcoholic at AA. She has seen him handle stress and loss and not resort to alcohol. \n(Tr. 96-108) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2I, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 details the personal conduct security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for alcohol consumption under AG \n\u00b6 22 and the following is potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for four DUIs from 2009 to 2018. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it  \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.  \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. The repeated DUI arrests reflect a recurring \npattern of questionable judgment, and unreliable and untrustworthy behavior. \nApplicant stated he was an alcoholic while attending AA meetings. His commitment \nto abstinence quickly waned, and he is drinking again. Although he attended AA \nmeetings, he has not had alcohol or substance abuse counseling. While some of \nhis life circumstances have changed, I cannot find that this behavior is infrequent \nor unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Despite Applicant\u2019s period of abstinence, he still \nhas not completely stopped drinking. He did not submit sufficient evidence that he \nhad alcohol or substance abuse treatment or counseling. He thinks he was told to \nstop drinking as early as 2009, and on more than one occasion. He minimized his \nalcohol use and related problems with the evaluator in 2011 and 2018, his former \nemployer, and his wife. While he claims he is not using alcohol as a coping \nmechanism, he reengaged in the same pattern that brought him to alcohol abuse \nand alcohol-related arrests. I cannot find that he has taken significant actions to \novercome this problem. \nApplicant has spent close to $20,000 on legal fees, and more than that on \nhospital fees. He injured himself and his dog and had a terrifying experience, spent \ntime in jail on multiple occasions, lost his driver\u2019s license for multiple periods, and \nhad to resign from his job and move to a new state. Despite this negative history, \nApplicant has continued drinking. It is difficult to find his claim credible that \neverything is different now. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to find that \nhe has taken satisfactory actions to overcome his maladaptive use of alcohol or \ndemonstrated a clear pattern of modified consumption. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, which were established \nunder Guideline G. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a) and (b) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. On four occasions Applicant\u2019s criminal \nbehavior resulted in an arrest, time in jail, and conviction. He drove while intoxicated while \non parole and without a driver\u2019s license. He incurred close to $20,000 in legal fees and \nhad to pay fines and court fees. While parts of his life have changed since his last arrest, \nthere is insufficient evidence to find these circumstances are unlikely to recur. It continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. While Applicant provided \nsome rehabilitative evidence, he attended AA meetings in 2012 and 2013 and later trade \nschool, he did not provide sufficient evidence to find that there has been successful \nrehabilitation, or mitigation by the passage of time or other factors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his witnesses\u2019 testimony. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). In his answer, he stated that he did not know he was responsible to repay debt that had dropped off his credit report. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old. Since 2022, he has worked overseas as a data entry technician for a government contractor. He was married in 2004, but he and his wife have been estranged and lived apart since 2016. He has three children, one who is still a minor. He took two years of college classes but did not earn a degree. He served on active duty in the Army from 2004-2007. He deployed to Iraq for seven months. He served in the Army National Guard from 2007-2008 and had one deployment to Kuwait. After leaving the military he worked for a government contractor overseas, including in Kuwait for 13 months, and in Iraq for 18 months. He was earning about $108,000 annually during this employment. (Tr. 16-49; GE 1) After his overseas contract ended in about December 2011, Applicant was unable to find more contract work overseas. He drove a bus for six months, took care of his children when his wife worked, and was unemployed. He used credit cards to supplement his savings and did not receive unemployment benefits. From 2013-2015, he took college classes and had his tuition and housing expenses paid",

Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-4, which were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant did not provide any documentation at the hearing. I held the record open for two \nweeks after the hearing to provide Applicant with the opportunity to submit documentary \nevidence. He submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-E, which were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). In his \nanswer, he stated that he did not know he was responsible to repay debt that had dropped \noff his credit report. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on \nmy review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. Since 2022, he has worked overseas as a data entry \ntechnician for a government contractor. He was married in 2004, but he and his wife have \nbeen estranged and lived apart since 2016. He has three children, one who is still a minor. \nHe took two years of college classes but did not earn a degree. He served on active duty \nin the Army from 2004-2007. He deployed to Iraq for seven months. He served in the \nArmy National Guard from 2007-2008 and had one deployment to Kuwait. After leaving \nthe military he worked for a government contractor overseas, including in Kuwait for 13 \nmonths, and in Iraq for 18 months. He was earning about $108,000 annually during this \nemployment. (Tr. 16-49; GE 1) \nAfter his overseas contract ended in about December 2011, Applicant was unable \nto find more contract work overseas. He drove a bus for six months, took care of his \nchildren when his wife worked, and was unemployed. He used credit cards to supplement \nhis savings and did not receive unemployment benefits. From 2013-2015, he took college \nclasses and had his tuition and housing expenses paid by the G.I. Bill. He estimated that \nhe had about $2,500 coming in monthly from the G.I. Bill and his Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) disability income. In 2016, he moved to State A and lived with his mother. (Tr. \n23-49; GE 1) \nFrom 2016-2021 he was unemployed but received about $1,000 monthly of \ndisability income from the VA. He used his VA disability income to fund lengthy overseas \ntravel to South Africa. He claimed the cost of living there was low. He estimated that he \ntook 11 trips to South Africa between 2018 and 2021. He did not make payments on his \ndelinquent debt during this time. (Tr. 23-61) \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling about $59,632. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit-card account that has been charged off for $14,746. The \naccount was opened in 2018. Applicant used the credit card for personal expenses, \nincluding electronics, plane tickets, and clothes for his children. He stopped paying it in \n2019. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 2, 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a military exchange credit-card account that has been charged off for \n$12,703. The account was opened in 2004. Applicant used it to purchase furnishings for \nhis apartment in 2012. He made no payments from 2012 until 2023. He claimed he started \nmaking $340 monthly payments in 2023. He provided documentation showing one \npayment in December 2023. The balance is listed as $7,423. He provided no \ndocumentation showing a track record of payments on this debt.

This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; AE \nB; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is an auto loan that has been charged off for $8,330. Applicant stated \nthe car was repossessed in about 2015 because he was unable to afford it. He has not \nmade any payments. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit-card account that has been placed for collection for $7,711. \nApplicant was unsure of the origin of this debt or what the credit card was used for. He \nspeculated that it could be related to SOR \u00b6 1.j but provided no documentation supporting \nthat assertion. He has not made any payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 30-49; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit-card account that has been placed for collection for $1,294. \nApplicant does not know the origin of this debt and has not made any payments on this \naccount. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit-card account that has been charged off for $781. Applicant \ndoes not know the origin of this debt and has not made any payments on this account. \nThis debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a credit-card account that has been charged off for $587. Applicant \nstated that this is a retail credit card that he used to buy clothing. He has not made any \npayments. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a credit-card account that has been placed for collection for $5,776. \nApplicant does not know the origin of this debt and has not made any payments on this \naccount. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a credit-card account that has been placed for collection for $575. \nApplicant does not know the origin of this debt and has not made any payments on this \naccount. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is an account with a jewelry store that has been charged off for $7,129. \nHe has not made any payments. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 30-49; GE 4) \nApplicant reported earning about $85,000 annually. His employer pays for his \nhousing expenses overseas. The budget form he submitted included his estranged wife\u2019s \nsalary. He testified that he did not know her income. The form also lists one debt payment \nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b at almost double the amount he claimed in his testimony. \nRemoving his estranged wife\u2019s income and adjusting the amount of this one debt \npayment, he has approximately $871 left over monthly after expenses. He has about \n$1.000 in savings. At the end of the hearing, Applicant reported he did not file income tax \nreturns between 2012 and 2022.

This matches the debt amount in \u00b6 \n1.a, but there is no indication on the credit report that it\u2019s the same debt. Applicant \nprovided no explanation about it. (AE C, D) \nApplicant submitted a professional character letter from someone who has known \nhim for three years. She states that he is honest, trustworthy, gets along well with his \ncoworkers, and is trying to get in a better financial position. (AE E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts are being paid, are resolved, or became delinquent \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His failure to pay these debts is both long-\nterm and recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. His behavior continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant failed to establish that his debts became \ndelinquent from conditions beyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \na good-faith effort to repay creditors or resolve debts, and he has not established any \nmeaningful track record of debt payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-due debts or evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \nAt the hearing, Applicant disclosed that he has not filed income tax returns from \n2012-2022. Although this tax issue was not alleged in the SOR, it is relevant in \nconsidering the potential applicability of the financial consideration mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letter. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising from his delinquent and unpaid \ndebts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments (with some changes as to dates), all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). On February 1, 2024, Applicant responded to the Amended SOR, and once again, admitted (with some changes as to dates) all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). Although he submitted a Response to the second Amended SOR on April 3, 2024, with extensive comments, Applicant failed to specifically \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d the two allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.), and denials 4 were accordingly entered. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a modeling and simulation principal engineer with his current employer since about January 2022.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2022, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories, and \nalso asked him to verify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. He \nresponded to those interrogatories and verified the summary on January 9, 2023. On \nJanuary 20, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) and detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a statement, dated February 17, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on March 14, 2023. The case was assigned to me \non September 11, 2023. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 17, 2023, scheduling \nthe hearing for November 14, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. During the \nhearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and GE 2, and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nAE D were admitted into evidence without objection. One Applicant witness testified, and \nanother witness was in the process of testifying when a medical emergency occurred, \nand I was unable to continue. All parties were advised of the situation and the remainder \nof the hearing was postponed. The initial transcript (I-Tr.) was received on November 22, \n2023. \nAnother Notice of Hearing was issued on January 5, 2024, scheduling the \nremainder of the hearing for January 16, 2024. Unfortunately, a snow emergency \ninterrupted all scheduling as the Government was closed, and the hearing was cancelled. \nAnother Notice of Hearing was issued on January 18, 2024, scheduling the hearing for \nFebruary 6, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant and the one witness \nwho was testifying when the initial hearing was terminated both testified. During this \nhearing, AE E and AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. The remaining \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on February 27, 2024. I kept the record open to enable the \nparties to supplement it, and Applicant took advantage of that opportunity by submitting \nadditional documents that were marked and admitted as AE G through AE J without \nobjection. The record closed on February 20, 2024. \nProcedural Issues \nOn November 13, 2023, Department Counsel, sua sponte, amended the SOR \nwithout submitting a motion. Applicant did not object to the amendments, and I requested \nthat he respond in writing to the amended allegations. He eventually did so. Also, during \nthe remaining hearing, on February 6, 2024, pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding two allegations associated with \nGuideline G (alcohol consumption): \n2.a. You were diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder in about June \n2023. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.b. You were admitted to inpatient substance abuse treatment at [an \nidentified facility] on approximately June 20, 2003, and discharged on \napproximately July 26, 2023. \nApplicant objected to the motion as untimely (agreeing to accept such evidence to be \nconsidered in the whole-person analysis) but arguing that most of the facts covered by \nthe proposed amendments were expressly known to the Government before the original \nSOR was issued. He added that the information also is mitigating information that appears \nin AE A. I noted that the issues were specifically discussed in GE 2 at 5-6, and 11-13, as \nwell as in AE A, both of which were received on November 6, 2023, pursuant to my Case \nManagement Order. Upon consideration of the motion and arguments made by both \nparties, I denied the motion and marked it as Administrative Exhibit I. (Tr. at 120-121). \nAfter the hearing was closed, but during the period that I kept the record open, \nDepartment Counsel renewed her motion to amend the SOR. \nThe Government argued that it must be able to resolve any doubts in favor of the \nnational security and it is imperative that it be allowed to address all security concerns \nraised by an applicant\u2019s behavior or circumstances in the SOR. Therefore, the \nGovernment has the right and the obligation to amend the SOR when necessary, so that \nall issues are addressed. In support of that statement, it cited an Appeal Board decision \ndeclaring that SORs are to be \u201cliberally construed and easily amended.\u201d (See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 04-08547 at p. 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2007); and ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2000)) It added that in order to ensure a full and fair adjudication of \ncases on their merits, form should not be elevated over substance in determining \namendments to the SOR, citing another Appeal Board decision that held that \u201cas long as \nthere is fair notice to the affected party and the affected party has a reasonable \nopportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues and \nnot concerned with pleading niceties.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-08547 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. \n30, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2000).) It argued \nadditionally, that even if the derogatory information was already known to the Government \nand it failed to make an allegation in the original SOR, \u201can amendment must be allowed \nbecause the Government cannot be estopped from national security.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n94-0966 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 21, 1995); Halkin v. Helms, 598 F. 2d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 1978). \nC.f. ISCR Case No. 07-00260 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2008)). \nI reconsidered the Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR for the second time. \nIn Section 22 \u2013 Police Record, in his SF 86, submitted on February 15, 2022, Applicant \ndescribed a stressful situation in February 2016, where Applicant and his wife had been \ndrinking, leading to a verbal altercation and his throwing a glass that broke, leading to his \narrest. (GE 1 at 46) In Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, in his SF 86, Applicant reported that \nin 2020, heavy drinking caused a lot of arguments, and he and his wife were \u201cdrinking \nvery heavily.\u201d (GE 1 at 52-53) In his Enhanced Subject Interview, conducted by an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on March 22, 2022, \nand attached to the interrogatories that were submitted to him to verify the accuracy of \nthe investigator\u2019s summary of the interview, Applicant discussed a drinking incident \ninvolving the broken glass (GE 2 at 15); consuming alcohol \u201cheavily\u201d during his marriage, \ncausing family issues and marital issues; a DUI arrest in October 2011 that required him \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto have an alcohol monitoring system installed on his vehicle for six months; the effect \nalcohol has on him; and his current drinking habits. (GE 2 at 16-17, 22-24, 29) Although \nthe Government was aware of all of the foregoing alcohol information, the DOHA security \nspecialist focused solely on the drug issues, essentially ignoring any possible alcohol \nissues. \nIn response to my first Case Management Order, dated October 16, 2023, \nApplicant submitted a document from a substance abuse treatment center which stated \nthat Applicant was assessed for substance abuse treatment and admitted for treatment \nof Alcohol Abuse Disorder. (AE A) On November 14, 2023, Applicant\u2019s first witness \u2013 his \nbrother-in-law \u2013 was aware that Applicant had received inpatient and outpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment for what he believed to be alcoholism in May 2023. While they \nbriefly resided together, the witness never saw Applicant intoxicated or under the \ninfluence to an unreasonable degree around the children. (I-Tr. at 25, 28-29) In addition, \nApplicant was treated by a licensed master social worker (LMSW) in late 2023 for a variety \nof issues including alcohol use recovery, managing stress and anxiety, and setting goals \nfor the future. (AE F) \nThe characterization of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use changed dramatically from the one \ndescribed in his SF 86, and Enhanced Subject Interview. Throughout college Applicant \nwould binge drink hard liquor multiple times a week. After he was divorced three years \nearlier, \u201chis drinking picked up to the point of being hospitalized multiple times a year for \npancreatitis. At his peak he was drinking a 12 pack of beer a day and sometimes 16-20 \nbeers a day. . . Longest period of sobriety was 1 week.\u201d He was diagnosed with Alcohol \nUse Disorder, Severe. (AE G at 1-2; AE I at 2) \nBased on the above, while I did not necessarily agree with all of Department \nCounsel\u2019s arguments, cited above, and I was especially disappointed with the \nquestionable quality and lack of thoroughness of the investigation in this case, after \nconsidering the new information regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption, I concluded \nthat there was good cause shown and justification to enable the Government to explore \nthe issue. Accordingly, on February 6, 2024, I reconsidered and granted the Motion to \nAmend the SOR as previously requested by Department Counsel. Applicant was granted \n30 days in which to respond to the new allegations, something he did on April 3, 2024, \nand both parties agreed that we should proceed on the established record without another \nhearing. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments (with some changes \nas to dates), all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance \nmisuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). On February 1, 2024, Applicant responded to the \nAmended SOR, and once again, admitted (with some changes as to dates) all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.h.). Although he submitted a Response to the second Amended SOR on April \n3, 2024, with extensive comments, Applicant failed to specifically \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d the \ntwo allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.), and denials \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere accordingly entered. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a modeling and simulation principal engineer with his current employer since about \nJanuary 2022. He was previously employed by various employers in a variety of full-time \npositions, including senior analyst (April 2021 \u2013 January 2022), and senior systems \nengineer (August 2017 \u2013 April 2021). He also held several part-time positions as an \nadjunct professor, tutor, or systems verification engineer. A 2006 high school graduate, \nhe received a Bachelor of Science in 2010, a Master of Science in 2011, and a Ph.D. in \natmospheric science in 2014. He has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted \na secret clearance in 2018. He was married in 2015 and divorced in 2021. He has no \nbiological children. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nWhile a student in college, Applicant occasionally used marijuana, but never \npurchased the substance. He never used the substance again. (Tr. at 92) \nAlthough Applicant and his wife had been together for several years before \nmarrying, about a year and one-half into their marriage, stress developed over the amount \nof work-related travel he was doing as well as wedding-related financial issues. Verbal \naltercations added to the stress, and the relationship became tumultuous and toxic. At \nabout their second-year anniversary, Applicant found out his wife was having an affair \nwith a friend of his best friend. A temporary separation took place while they tried to work \nthings out. But, as Applicant described the situation, \u201cthings only went from bad to worse.\u201d \nShe ended up continuing to see this guy, she dropped out of school, wasn\u2019t \nworking, and became heavily involved in drugs. The guy she was with was \nactive in the drug scene and I believe this was one of the major reasons she \nwent completely off the deep end. As we continued to attempt to work on \nour marriage, things continued to get worse and she became fully addicted \nto drugs, particularly cocaine. She would show up high and with drugs on \nher and over time, I somehow thought it would help our marriage if I became \ninvolved in drug use with her. Obviously, I was going through a lot of \ndepression and mentally compromised and blinded by my love for her and \nthe pain I was feeling, in the short term. It seemed to work (cocaine use), \nand she would stay with me, but she always ended up going back with this \nguy. We went through this cycle over and over again, and cocaine became \nthe center of whatever the relationship had become. It almost seemed like \nthe last thing holding us together, so I continued to remain involved in drug \nuse with her, which is how I was justifying the usage. This was the first time \nin my life I had ever been involved in any way in illegal drugs and have \nalways been adamantly against this type of behavior. The cycle went on for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover a year until I decided to completely remove myself from the situation \nand ultimately followed through with our divorce. It was a painful, long \nprocess as my love for her ran so deep: I did not want to give up on the \nmarriage. However, over time it became obvious how unhealthy the \nrelationship was, particularly with her level of influence over me with the \ndrug use. I never used drugs unless I was with her, and once we split, I \nhave not used or had no desire to use cocaine. It was a desperate attempt \nto try to hold on to the relationship. \n(GE 1 at 49) \nOn about an estimated half-dozen occasions, Applicant periodically purchased \ncocaine \u2013 a Schedule II Controlled Substance \u2013 from about May 2019 to about February \n2020, and he used the powdered substance with varying frequency on maybe 100 \noccasions in their apartment \u2013 always with his wife and sometimes with her brother as \nwell \u2013 from about May 2019 to about May 2020. During the period of his drug involvement \nand substance misuse, he was employed in a sensitive position.

(Tr. at 133) Clinically, Applicant met the criteria for \nsubstance use disorder due to his episodes of bingeing cocaine. He was very active and \ninsightful on his own treatment. The therapist added: \nFurthermore, his ability to dissolve an entire marriage based on the insight \nof the relationship\u2019s unhealthy triggering of substance use patterns provides \na true glimpse into an overall positive future prognosis in the maintenance \nof his own sobriety. Due to his continued sobriety, increased emotional \nstability and decision not to return to (the state of the marriage) or his past \nrelationships; I feel very confident in his ability to continue to grow beyond \nthis dark chapter in his life and maintain his sobriety. His continuing success \nis likely dependent on his ability to maintain effective interpersonal support \nsystems, engagement in a minimum of once monthly outpatient \nappointments and attendance of support groups in his area. \n(AE C) \nFrom May 11, 2023, until July 26, 2023, Applicant received in-person substance \nabuse treatment from a licensed substance abuse counseling facility. He took part in daily \nday long therapeutic activities, group therapy, individual therapy, psycho-educational \ngroups and lectures, random drug/alcohol screens, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings, and medication management. He participated in a \nbio-psycho-social assessment and a psychiatric evaluation to determine the best course \nof treatment. While he was administered the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) which \naddresses depression, and the screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) \nwhich addresses anxiety, it is unclear if Applicant was administered any clinical tests that \nled to any professional conclusions associated with substance abuse. (AE I at 1) He was \nadmitted to treatment for alcohol use disorder, severe, but also reported having struggled \nwith narcotic/illicit substance use in the past, and that he hasn\u2019t used any narcotics since \n2020. \nApplicant was directed to \u201ccompletely eradicate alcohol and to build the tools in my \narsenal to sustain that sobriety.\u201d (Tr. at 64) He was also expected to participate in a 12-\nstep programming, therapist and/or sponsor, sober support network, accountability, \nholistic activities, readings, prayer, medications, all on a daily basis and avoiding outfalls \nsuch as distractions and complacency. (AE I at 2) Despite those expectations, Applicant \ndoesn\u2019t particularly like going to AA meetings and dedicating an hour of every day to \ntalking about alcohol when, in his mind, alcohol \u201cis the past.\u201d (Tr. at 68) Furthermore, he \nconsiders alcohol to be a part of his \u201cprevious life.\u201d (Tr. at 70) Accordingly, he went to AA \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonly a few times and believes he obtained a sponsor, but he disagreed with the philosophy \nof literally having someone talk about sobriety every day.

(Tr. at 5-30) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro.

Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase. . .; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; and \n(f)  any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2018, and he has held sensitive \npositions since that time. Because of stress in his tumultuous and toxic marriage, and in \nan effort to repair his relationship with his substance-abusing wife, during the period from \nabout May 2019 through May 2020, he periodically purchased and used cocaine and \nMDMA with her. Cocaine became the center of whatever relationship they had until the \nrelationship ended with their separation and eventual divorce. He subsequently voluntarily \nunderwent several professional relationships with licensed medical and mental health \nprofessionals and was found to have met the criteria for a diagnosis of substance use \ndisorder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(d), and 25(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b), and 26(d) apply. Applicant desperately tried to hold his \nmarriage together although his wife was in a continuing sexual relationship with another \nindividual and she became fully addicted to drugs, particularly cocaine. Depressed and \nmentally compromised, as well as blinded by his love for her, Applicant somehow thought \nit would help their marriage if he became involved in drug use with her. The joint cocaine \nuse seemed to work temporarily, and she would stay with him, but she always ended up \ngoing back to her lover. The cycle repeated itself several times until he realized that \ncocaine became the center of their relationship and was the last thing holding them \ntogether. He finally decided to completely remove himself from the situation. Separation \nand the June 2021 divorce followed. Applicant was candid about his involvement with \ndrugs when he reported it in his SF 86 and spoke openly about it with investigators and \nhealth care providers. He enrolled in a variety of therapy and substance abuse treatment \nprograms, successfully completed those programs, and has been abstinent from any \nillegal drug use since May 2020 \u2013 nearly four years. He has no continuing relationship \nwith his ex-wife and has no desire to use drugs in the future. His relatively limited one-\nyear period of involvement with illegal drugs no longer casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for \nAlcohol Consumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has been consuming alcohol since he was a senior in high school. He \ndrank socially throughout college and would binge drink hard liquor multiple times a week. \nWhile a university student, he usually consumed alcohol every weekend with six beers at \nfootball games, as well as unspecified amounts after work or during softball games. His \nalcohol consumption resulted in two incidents in which the police were involved. In \nOctober 2011, after consuming four beers, he was stopped by the police while driving \nhome. As a result of his refusal to blow into the breathalyzer, he was charged and arrested \nfor DUI. As part of a plea deal, he had a breathalyzer installed in his vehicle for six months. \nHe denied that he was intoxicated at the time. The charge was eventually dismissed, and \nthen expunged from his record. He continued to consume alcohol for about 13 years, and \nhe did so to the point of intoxication maybe once a month. \nIn February 2016, he and his wife had been drinking during a period of stress that \nled to a verbal altercation. He threw a glass that broke against the wall. His wife called \nthe police and Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal mischief. The charge \nwas eventually dropped. Applicant admitted that they were drinking, but he denied that \nhe was drunk. During June and July 2020, when COVID-19 was at its peak and Applicant \nand his wife were residing together trying to reconcile, their heavy alcohol consumption \nas a coping mechanism in dealing with stress and COVID-related confinement led to \u201ca \nlot of arguments.\u201d Applicant initially acknowledged that he consumed a 12-pack of beer \nevery day during that period, but later changed the estimate to not daily, but limited to the \nperiod from mid-March 2020 until May 2020. \nApplicant engaged the professional services of various medical and mental health \nproviders to address his issues, some of which had no association with substance abuse. \nThe most intensive focused program was the one that specifically addressed substance \nabuse and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to treatment for alcohol use disorder, severe, \nbut also reported having struggled with narcotic/illicit substance use in the past, ending in \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n2020. The final diagnoses were, among other issues, alcohol use disorder, severe; and \nalcohol induced acute pancreatitis without necrosis or infection. Applicant was directed to \n\u201ccompletely eradicate alcohol and to build the tools in my arsenal to sustain that sobriety.\u201d \nHe was also expected to participate in a 12-step programming, therapist and/or sponsor, \nsober support network, accountability, holistic activities, readings, prayer, medications, \nall on a daily basis and avoiding outfalls such as distractions and complacency. However, \nbecause he considers alcohol to be a part of his \u201cprevious life,\u201d he went to AA only a few \ntimes and disagreed with the philosophy of literally having someone talk about sobriety \nevery day.  \nAs noted above, Applicant contends that his sobriety date is April 27, 2023, but \nduring the hearing he acknowledged that prior to entering rehabilitation in May 2023, he \nwas still drinking \u201ca moderate amount daily, but not to excess.\u201d He quantified the amount \nas two to three drinks per day and maybe a little bit more (maybe six) on weekends. A \nMay 2023 psychiatric evaluation noted that Applicant has always been a heavy drinker \nbut \u201conce he got divorced three years ago his drinking picked up to the point of being \nhospitalized multiple times a year for pancreatitis. At his peak he was drinking at least a \n12 pack of beer a day and sometimes 16-20 beers a day.\u201d It added that his longest period \nof sobriety was one week. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nNeither of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant fulfilled all treatment \nrecommendations, met all treatment goals and objectives, continued to test negative on \nall random drug/alcohol screens, showed no signs of continued use, and was discharged \nfor having successfully completed all prescribed treatment. Nevertheless, he appears to \nbe minimizing his alcohol consumption and the impact it has had on his life, and he has \nnever acknowledged that there was a significant long-standing pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use. He initially indicated that his consumption of alcohol was some time ago and \nwas no longer of any significance. He suggested that there was no pattern since the DUI \nwas in 2011 (he denied being intoxicated) and had not been repeated, and his 2017 glass-\nthrowing incident did not involve intoxication, but merely the consumption of alcohol. He \nacknowledged that during June and July 2020 his alcohol consumption was a coping \nmechanism in dealing with stress and COVID-related confinement which led to a lot of \narguments. He initially acknowledged that he consumed a 12-pack of beer every day \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring that period, but later changed the estimate to not daily, but limited to the period \nfrom mid-March 2020 until May 2020. But Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol did not \ncease when he and his wife split up for the final time. He acknowledged that prior to \nentering rehabilitation in May 2023, he was still drinking \u201ca moderate amount daily, but \nnot to excess,\u201d which he quantified as two to three drinks per day and maybe a little bit \nmore (maybe six) on weekends. However, his May 2023 psychiatric evaluation noted that \nApplicant has always been a heavy drinker but \u201conce he got divorced three years ago his \ndrinking picked up to the point of being hospitalized multiple times a year for pancreatitis. \nAt his peak he was drinking at least a 12 pack of beer a day and sometimes 16-20 beers \na day.\u201d It added that his longest period of sobriety was one week. \nApplicant failed to address inconsistencies in the evidence regarding alcohol \nabuse and failed to demonstrate a clear and established pattern of abstinence. Moreover, \nhe failed to fully comply with the post-treatment recommendations and disagreed with the \nrehabilitation facility\u2019s characterization of drinking two or three drinks a day as binge \ndrinking. He continues to believe that in the past seven years, or ever, alcohol has not \nhad a negative impact on his professional or personal relationships or his work \nperformance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and Guideline G in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in SEAD 4, App. A. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and Guideline G, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant proffered \nsubstantial mitigating evidence, which was more than sufficient to overcome the \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions established under Guideline H. During the period from about May \n2019 through May 2020, because of stress in his tumultuous and toxic marriage, and in \nan effort repair his relationship with his substance-abusing wife, he periodically purchased \nand used cocaine and MDMA with her. Cocaine became the center of whatever \nrelationship they had until the relationship ended with their separation and eventual \ndivorce. He subsequently voluntarily underwent several professional relationships with \nlicensed medical and mental health professionals and was found to have met the criteria \nfor a diagnosis of substance use disorder. He has not used any illegal drugs since they \nsplit up and has been abstinent from such substances for nearly four years. His desperate \nactions during that relatively brief period of his life in attempting to save his marriage are \nconsidered aberrant behavior on his part. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s long-standing and substantially more recent involvement \nwith alcohol under Guideline G raised substantially more serious issues in the context of \nthe whole person. Moderate consumption did not cease in 2020 once the marriage was \nterminated. Instead, perhaps substituting alcohol for drugs, his drinking increased to the \npoint of being hospitalized multiple times a year for pancreatitis. At one point he was \ndrinking at least a 12 pack of beer a day and sometimes 16-20 beers a day. His longest \nperiod of sobriety was one week. It is also significant that while he successfully completed \ntreatment, he failed to fully comply with all the recommendations for after-care, and he \nhas disagreed with the professionals as to what constitutes binge drinking. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse but failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his alcohol consumption. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, with explanations, but he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a U.S. defense contractor. He began working at his present job in August 2017. He has worked for U.S. defense contractors since his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 2009. He served in the Marine Corps from 1995 to 2009, and he served in combat areas on three deployments. He is a high school graduate.

His transmittal documents were marked as administrative exhibits \n(AD) I-IV. Also, the Government\u2019s evidence is admitted into the record without objection. \n(Items 2-8). The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, with explanations, but he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.d. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of \nthe pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a U.S. defense contractor. He began \nworking at his present job in August 2017. He has worked for U.S. defense contractors \nsince his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 2009. He served in the Marine \nCorps from 1995 to 2009, and he served in combat areas on three deployments. He is a \nhigh school graduate. He is twice divorced (first divorce in 2003, second in 2019) and \nhas four children. He pays monthly child and spousal support in a total amount of \n$2,530. (Items 2-3) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2021, as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d); that \nhe owes federal taxes for tax year 2021 in the amount of approximately $14,400 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c); and that he failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax years 2011, \n2012, 2018, 2019, and 2020, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe SOR also alleged a delinquent account in the amount of approximately \n$11,300. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, admissions on his July 2020 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), his responses to an investigator during his \nbackground interview in November 2020, his responses to interrogatories from \nSeptember 2022, and a credit report from October 2020, establish the SOR allegations. \n(Items 1-5) \nApplicant explained that he got into financial difficulties when he was deployed \nserving overseas in about 2008. He believed his ex-wife was taking care of their \nfinancial responsibilities, including filing their tax returns and paying any taxes owed. \nShe was not doing this. His 2019 divorce also contributed to his financial difficulties. \nSince becoming aware of his tax problems, he hired a tax service and has filed his \nmissing federal and state tax returns, as noted below. All his 2011 federal tax \nremediation efforts took place before the SOR was issued, as did his filing of his state \ntax returns. He accepted responsibility for failing to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for the years indicated.

(AE A35-A49) \nTY 2021 \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 federal tax return was received by the IRS on \nJune 5, 2023. He owed taxes of approximately $14,400 for this tax year. \nApplicant paid this amount, although the record does not reflect the date of \npayment. A document from the official IRS website shows that Applicant has a \nzero balance towards the IRS. Another document from the IRS website, dated \nAugust 30, 2023, shows zero amount owed for TYs 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. \n(Item 1, pp. 25-26; AE A27) \nApplicant documented his state income tax return filings as follows: \nTY 2011 \nFiled before May 2019. (AE A35, AE A39) \nTY 2012 \nApplicant stated that he filed \u201call\u201d his state tax returns. Although he \ndid not provide a document directly showing that his 2012 return was filed, he \nprovided documentation showing that he received refunds from his state in 2021 \nand 2022, something he would not receive if he had missing tax returns. I can \nreasonably infer that his 2012 state return was filed during or before 2021. (Item \n2, pp. 29-33, Item 4, p. 8) \nTY 2018 \nFiled December 2021. (Item 4, p. 8) \nTY 2019 \nFiled November 2021. (Item 4, p. 8) \nTY 2020 \nFiled November 2021. (Item 4, p. 8) \nApplicant was unfamiliar with the sole delinquent debt listed in the SOR for \napproximately $11,000 but believed it could be related to siding he purchased for his \nhome, which was foreclosed in 2012. He originally purchased this property in about \n2001, as his residence when he was in the Marine Corps. He later turned it into rental \nproperty. At some point, he was unable to rent it and could not pay the mortgage. The \nproperty sold for more than the mortgage amount and Applicant actually made \napproximately $10,000 from the sale proceeds. He is sure this debt was included as \npart of the foreclosure settlement and was resolved from the proceeds of the 2012 sale. \nApplicant contacted the named creditor of this debt, but the creditor could provide no \ninformation about the debt. This debt is not listed on his most recent credit report.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe evidence showed Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011 and 2021. He also failed to timely file his state income tax returns for \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, and 2020. He owed delinquent taxes for 2021 in the \namount of $14,430 and owed another delinquent debt in the amount of $11,319. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant should have responded in a more timely fashion to resolve his tax \nissues. However, initially his deployment and subsequently his second divorce \ncontributed to his delay in resolving his tax issues. He demonstrated responsible action \nhiring a tax service, which prepared his missing state and federal returns. He was able \nto file his 2011 federal return and all of his missing state returns before the issuance of \nthe SOR. He paid his 2021 federal tax debt and now has a zero balance with the IRS. \nThere are clear indications that his tax issues are resolved, and recurrence is unlikely \nbecause he now has a firm handle on his tax filing responsibilities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b),20(c), \nand 20(g) all substantially apply. \nApplicant credibly conveyed that the non-tax delinquent debt was resolved from \nthe proceeds of his foreclosure sale in 2012. His dispute of this debt is corroborated by \nthe lack of an entry concerning this debt on his most recent credit report from \nSeptember 2022. His follow-up action by contacting the creditor produced no contrary \nevidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) substantially applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his combat deployments, and \nhis contractor service. I am convinced he will act in a timely manner filing and paying his \nfederal and state tax returns and taxes from now on. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Its exhibit list and \ndiscovery letter were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified, but he \ndid not offer any exhibits at the hearing. The record remained open until January 5, \n2024, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, which he did not submit. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 11, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all but two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.i), which he denied. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 2013, as \na field engineer. During parts of 2022 and 2023, he also held two different part-time \npositions, both working in the informational technology field.

(Tr. 6, 23-\n25, 28-29; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2020 and 2021 federal and state \nincome tax returns, as required. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) It also alleged Applicant had eight \ndelinquent debts, either charged off or in collection status, totaling approximately \n$61,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.j) \nTax Return Non-Filings. \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2020 and 2021 federal and \nstate income tax returns. He testified that those tax returns remain unfiled as of the date \nof his hearing, December 1, 2023. He also has not filed his 2022 federal and state tax \nreturns. (Since the non -filing of his 2022 returns was not alleged in the SOR, I will not \nuse this evidence for disqualification purposes, however, I may use it for credibility, \ndetermining mitigation, and in assessing the whole-person factors.) (Tr. 26, 37, 39; SOR \nanswer; GE 2) \nApplicant explained that the reason he had not filed his 2020 and 2021 federal \ntax returns was because he was in a dispute over the amount of child support he should \npay and an attorney told him those returns could be used against him to establish a \nhigher child support payment plan. Later, he realized this information was not helping \nhim with his child support case. He then talked to a financial advisor and is gathering \nthe necessary documents to file these returns, but as of yet, he has not \u201cpulled the \ntrigger\u201d to file his delinquent federal returns for 2020 and 2021.

He acknowledged in his testimony that he owned a house in that state \nfrom which he derived rental income of approximately $13,500 a year. This would \nrequire him to file state income tax returns, which he has not done. (Tr. 34-35, 40; SOR \nAnswer) \nDelinquent Debts. \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$21,476. This is an automobile loan for a repossessed car. Applicant \ntestified that he purchased this Italian automobile in approximately 2019. The car was \nvalued at approximately $84,000. Shortly thereafter, he became aware that he was \ngoing to be the father of a child and the subsequent child support ramifications. He \nelected to voluntarily return the car to the dealership approximately three months after \nhis purchase. The amount alleged in the SOR was the payments he owed at the time of \nhis voluntary surrender. The charged-off amount by the creditor was approximately \n$84,000. During his August 2022 background interview, he told the investigator that he \nplanned to set up a payment plan or pay a lump-sum payment on the outstanding \nbalance. Applicant produced no evidence that he made arrangements to pay or settle \nthis debt and has not been in contact with the creditor in the last year. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 42-44; GE 2-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d-$14,725. The debt arose from a home equity loan. Applicant claimed \nthat he was making payments and was current on this debt. He failed to provide \ndocumentation supporting his assertion. His most recent credit report in the record \nshows that this debt was charged off. It reflects the last payment made was in October \n2021. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 45; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e-$13,047. This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant admitted the debt \nand his failure to make any payments on it. His most recent credit report in the record \nshows that this debt was charged off. It reflects the last payment made was in March \n2021. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 46; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f-$4,958. This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant admitted the debt \nand his failure to make any payments on it. His most recent credit report in the record \nshows that this debt was charged off. It reflects the last payment made was in \nSeptember 2021. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 47-48; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g-$3,725. This is a delinquent credit card.

Applicant admitted the debt \nand his failure to make any payments on it. A credit report in the record shows that this \ndebt was charged off. It reflects a date of last activity as April 2022. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 51; GE 4) \nOther Financial Factors. \nApplicant testified that his gross monthly salary from his full-time position is \napproximately $10,500. His gross monthly salary from PT1 is approximately $11,000 \nand his gross monthly salary from PT2 is also approximately $11,000. For part of 2022, \nwhen he worked his regular job and his two part-time jobs, his gross monthly salary was \napproximately $32,500. During his background interview, he estimated that his monthly \nexpenses and debt servicing (excluding the SOR debts) was $4,360. He provides \napproximately $600 per month of financial support to his parents. He repaid a $5,000 \nloan from his brother. He valued his home, where he accrues monthly rental income, at \napproximately $135,000. In May 2023, he purchased another foreign automobile valued \nat approximately $67,000. He is current on those monthly payments of $1,450. He took \nvacations in 2022 to three different foreign countries. He currently has approximately \n$10,000 in savings and $15,000 in retirement accounts. He has not sought financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 30-35, 52-56, 58, 61, 64; GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has six delinquent debts that remain unpaid. He also failed to timely file \nhis 2020-2021 federal and state income tax returns. Evidence established that he has \nthe financial means to address his taxes and debts, but he has chosen not to do so. I \nfind all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has filed his 2020 and 2021 federal \nand state tax returns. He created his tax problem himself by deciding to listen to advice \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfrom an attorney not to file the returns in order to minimize his potential child support \nobligations.

None of the mitigating \nconditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nApplicant paid two of the SOR debts and they are resolved in his favor, However, \nhe failed to address the six remaining debts despite having the financial resources to do \nso. Rather than addressing his debt, he chose instead to buy a $65,000 automobile and \ntake three foreign vacations in 2022. He failed to present sufficient evidence that he \ntakes his financial obligations seriously. His lack of action toward resolving these debts \nand choices about how he spends his considerable income, call into question his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not sought financial counseling. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g and 1.j. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. However, Applicant has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility when it comes to resolving his tax \nissues or paying his delinquent debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g and 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His request for eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 15, 2022, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as part of his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information. \nOn May 3, 2023, the DCSA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).

As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on July 27, 2023. The FORM proffered seven exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the Government relied to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He responded to the FORM by providing a three-\npage exhibit included in the record, without objection, as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. I \nreceived the case for decision on November 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between May \n2017 and April 2022 (SOR 1.a); and that he used marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance in approximately March 2007 (SOR 1.b). (FORM, Item 1) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately made false \nstatements of relevant and material facts to the government by failing to disclose his illegal \ndrug use as required by e-QIPs he submitted in September 2006 (SOR 2.a) and in \nJanuary 2017 (SOR 2.b). Additionally, it was alleged he made false statements of relevant \nand material facts to the government by failing to disclose his illegal drug use while \npossessing a security clearance as required by his January 2017 e-QIP (SOR 2.c). The \nSOR also cross-alleged as disqualifying personal conduct the illegal drug use addressed \nin SOR 1.a and 1.b (SOR 2.d). (FORM, Item 1) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations. A review of his response to the allegations of intentional false statements, \nhe also expressly denied that he \u201cintended to make false claims or falsify documents.\u201d \n(FORM, Item 2) Accordingly, I have interpreted his response as a denial of SOR 2.a, 2.b, \nand 2.c. As such, those allegations presented controverted issues of fact and the burden \nof proof for those facts remained with the Government. (See Directive at E3.1.14) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the remaining allegations, \nand based on my review of the information presented in the FORM and AE A, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor located in State A, \nwhere he has lived since September 2005. He has worked for that employer since August \n2006. He graduated from high school in 2001 and received a college degree in May 2005. \nHe and his wife have been together since about 2003 and married in 2013. They have \ntwo children under ten years old. (FORM, Item 3) \nApplicant has held at least a secret-level security clearance for his entire tenure \nwith his current employer. He submitted an e-QIP in September 2006 to obtain eligibility \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor a security clearance when he was first hired. He submitted another e-QIP in January \n2017 to renew his eligibility. The e-QIP he submitted in March 2022 appears to have been \nintended to qualify him for a top secret-level clearance. In response to the FORM, \nApplicant indicated he no longer requires eligibility at the top-secret level. (FORM, Items \n3 \u2013 5, 7; AE A). \nApplicant first used marijuana in high school. He used it once in May 2001 and did \nnot use it again until 2009. In 2009, his then girlfriend and future wife was receiving \nchemotherapy as part of her cancer treatment. At the time, it was legal in State A to use \nmarijuana with a medical prescription, which she was given to help her tolerate the effects \nof her cancer treatments. Applicant started using some of her medical marijuana with her \nto help him cope with the stress of their situation. It was still illegal in State A for him to \ndo so at that time. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 6; AE A) \nIn November 2016, State A legalized the personal possession and use of \nmarijuana for persons over 21 years of age. Subsequently, Applicant began using \nmarijuana a few times monthly to alleviate back pain and other aches and pains he was \nexperiencing. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 6; AE A) \nOn April 21 and May 11, 2022, Applicant completed personal subject interviews \n(PSI) with a government investigator as part of his current background investigation. In \nhis April PSI, he affirmed his intent to continue using marijuana because it is legal in State \nA. In his May PSI, he was confronted with the fact that the use and possession of \nmarijuana are still illegal under federal law, and that as a federal contractor he is required \nto follow federal law. He claimed that he had not been made aware by his company of the \nneed to follow federal laws regarding marijuana but stated he would seek advice from his \nemployer. (FORM, Item 6) \nI take administrative notice of the fact that the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana \nis tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a federally controlled substance, the unauthorized\npossession and use of which are criminal violations of the Controlled Substances Act, 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 802 et seq. During his May PSI, he acknowledged his understanding that use of\nmarijuana is still a violation of federal criminal law. Guidance issued by the Office of the\nAssistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in February 2013, which was updated by the\nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) in December 2021, makes clear that changes in\nthe laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, territories, and the District of\nColumbia do not alter the current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. Because\nfederal law supersedes state laws on this issue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless\nof location or even medical justification in his state of residence, was illegal. Further,\nfederal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal employees and by persons\nemployed for work on federal contracts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana since April 2022. In his response to being asked \nthrough DOHA interrogatories why he stopped, he stated: \nI realized I was making a mistake and that federal laws need to be held in \nhigher regard than my local state laws. I chose to find another method for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npain relief that follows all federal laws. My career is important to me, and I \ndo not want to do anything to jeopardize that, especially not when other \nmeans of pain relief are readily available. (FORM, Item 6) \nWhen Applicant was hired by his employer in 2006, he was administered a \nurinalysis drug test, which he presumably passed. Thereafter, he submitted an e-QIP to \nobtain a secret-level security clearance. He did not disclose in that application, as \nrequired by questions in e-QIP Section 24 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity), \nthat he had used marijuana in high school. He subsequently received a security \nclearance. (FORM, Items 5 and 7) \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information was renewed in 2017 \nbased, in part, on the information he submitted in a second e-QIP on January 11, 2017. \nIn that e-QIP, he again did not disclose his use of marijuana as required by questions in \nSection 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity). By this time, he had been using \nmarijuana with his wife since 2009 and once it became legal in late 2016, he was using it \nseveral times a month. It was not until he submitted his most recent e-QIP in March 2022, \nthat he responded \u201cyes\u201d to Section 23 questions, thereby disclosing that he used \nmarijuana as discussed herein, above. (FORM, Items 3 \u2013 5) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant stated he \u201cwas a young kid who made a stupid \nmistake\u201d in omitting his drug use from the first e-QIP. He also stated that he made \nmistakes by completing the form too quickly. As to his second e-QIP, he stated he did not \nthink he needed to change any of the pre-populated information from his first e-QIP and \nthat he probably rushed his completion of that form as well. However, in his second e-\nQIP, he took enough time to provide new information about his passport, his residences, \npersonal references, his marital status, foreign travel, and his prior background \ninvestigation. In response to the FORM, he admitted that he was \u201cscared of what might \nhappen if [he] told the truth\u201d when he submitted his first e-QIP, and that he wishes he \n\u201chad been strong enough to be honest.\u201d As to his second e-QIP, he avers he \u201cfailed to do \n[his] due diligence 10 years later.\u201d (FORM, Items 2, 4 and 5; AE A) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant also provided a signed statement stating he \nintends to abstain from all illegal drug use in the future, and with the understanding that \nany future use could result in the loss of his security clearance. He further described his \nefforts (e.g., yoga, exercise, dietary changes) at alternative pain and stress relief. His wife \nprovided a statement to the effect that she believes Applicant is \u201c100% honest,\u201d and she \ncorroborated the lifestyle changes he has made. (AE A) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, \u00b6 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAvailable information reasonably raises the security concern about drug \ninvolvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.

Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure \nto clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant first used marijuana in high school. Starting in 2009, he used it \nextensively over the next 13 years until April 2022. His use violated federal law even \nthough marijuana for personal consumption has been generally legal in State A since \n2016. His frequent illegal drug use began three years after receiving a security clearance \nin 2006 and continued after his clearance eligibility was renewed in 2017. In an April 2022 \nPSI, he stated he would continue using marijuana because it was legal to do so under \nstate law. In May 2022, when advised of the continuing illegality under federal law, he \nsaid only that he would have to seek his employer\u2019s advice. This information supports \nboth of the above-named disqualifying conditions. \nSOR 1.b alleges that Applicant used marijuana \u201cafter being granted a security \nclearance.\u201d The pertinent disqualifying condition at issue here is AG 25(f) (any illegal drug \nuse while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position). \n(Emphasis added.) The DOHA Appeal Board has held that to be disqualifying, the drug \nuse at issue must have occurred while actually having access to that information. See \nISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (Appeal Board, August 10, 2022) ([I]t is important to note \nthe distinction between possessing a security clearance and being granted access to \nclassified material.) The SOR did not on its face allege a disqualifying condition (AG \u00b6 \n25(f)) and the Government\u2019s information did not establish that Applicant had access to \nclassified information concurrent with his use of marijuana. SOR 1.b is resolved for \nApplicant. \nI also have considered the following pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome \nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, \nbut not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAppellant provided a sworn statement of his intent to abstain from illegal drug use \nin the future. He also has made lifestyle changes to address his stated reasons for using \nmarijuana; namely, stress and physical pain. The persuasive value of this information is \nattenuated by an absence of medical documentation about his ailments, and by his \ndeliberate omissions (discussed under Guideline E, below) of his drug use when he \napplied for a security clearance in 2006 and in his request for renewal thereof in 2017. \nAdditionally, because he used drugs on a frequent basis over a long period of time, his \napparent abstinence since April 2022 does not constitute a sufficient period from which \nto conclude it will not recur. On balance, available information does not show the security \nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s protracted use of illegal drugs are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern about personal conduct is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nBased on the discussion of SOR 1.b, above, the allegation at SOR 2.c is resolved \nfor Applicant. Further, the cross-allegation at SOR 2.d of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use as \ndisqualifying personal conduct is resolved for Applicant. Having concluded that the \nsecurity concerns about his drug use are disqualifying under Guideline H, it is duplicative \nto address it under this guideline. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 2.a and 2.b, Applicant did not disclose his use of marijuana as required \nby both his first and his second e-QIPs. He denied in response to the SOR any intent to \nsubmit false statements. However, in response to the FORM, he acknowledged he feared \nthe consequences that might ensue if he told the truth about his drug use when he first \napplied for a clearance. As to his second e-QIP, he regretted not exercising \u201cdue \ndiligence\u201d when he reapplied for eligibility for access to classified information. It is unclear \nfrom his statement what \u201cdue diligence\u201d was required to answer the questions correctly. \nNonetheless, it is clear that he knew he was using marijuana within the scope of the \nrelevant questions and that he decided to repeat his omission of that information. Further, \nhis explanation that he was somehow careless in his second e-QIP is belied by the fact \nthat he updated his information in several other aspects of that application. I conclude \nfrom all of the information probative of his intent when he submitted his e-QIPs shows he \nintended to withhold relevant material information from the government. As a result of his \nomissions, the government did not have sufficient information required to make an \naccurate, well-informed decision about his suitability for access. \nThe foregoing requires application of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a): \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not try to correct his omissions until he applied for a higher level of \nclearance in his third e-QIP. His first e-QIP could have been corrected at any time after \nhe was hired in 2006; however, he continued to illegally use marijuana and did not \ndisclose his conduct. When he reapplied for clearance eligibility in 2017, he again chose \nto conceal his conduct. He did so on both occasions because he was afraid of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsequences of telling the truth about his drug use. Further, there is no indication here \nthat he sought guidance in how to answer the e-QIP questions at issue or that he may \nhave received legal or other professional counsel about these matters when he was \ncompleting the forms. \nFinally, his falsifications cannot be considered minor offenses. These facts \nundermine the government\u2019s confidence in the accuracy of the first two adjudications of \nhis clearance eligibility because they were based on incomplete information. It was not \nuntil this third assessment of Applicant\u2019s background, that the government has learned \nthat he illegally used drugs in violation of federal law and that he intentionally lied about \nhis drug use the first two times he was asked to disclose that information. This information \ndemonstrates that he has been willing to put his own concerns ahead of the national \ninterest, and precludes the application of any mitigating conditions under this guideline. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines H and E, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s continued and \nfrequent drug use, and his willingness to withhold information from the government are \ndirectly at odds with the government\u2019s compelling interest in trusting that those who have \naccess to classified information will put the national interest ahead of their own. Significant \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for clearance persist. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, those \ndoubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

(Tr. 35-46, 72-\n73, 111; GE 1, 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s family left the family home and stayed in other locations with friends \nand family for about four years. In about 2011, they thought it was safe to come back \nand began remodeling the home. Shortly after they came back to their home, unknown \nindividuals followed Applicant\u2019s eldest brother while he was driving and drove \naggressively and dangerously around his car. Fortunately, he was able to lose them. \n(Tr. 43-46, 111-114; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s other brother is a car salesman in Iraq who has never been affiliated \nwith the Iraqi government. He is married and has two children. Applicant also speaks \nwith this brother about once per week via telephone. This brother has also applied to \ncome to the U.S. In September 2023, the relevant U.S. agency told him to get prepared \nfor an impending interview in furtherance of his application. Applicant claimed that this \nbrother will come to the United States and live with him for a brief time until he gets \nsettled.

I take administrative notice of the information contained in \nthose documents including, but not limited to: \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and \nlimited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and \nWestern companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \noccur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and \nstrikes occur frequently. These events can develop quickly without prior notification, \noften interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the \npotential to turn violent. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia\u00ad\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through 2022, with reports of more \nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. Another, similar incident in August \n2022 resulted in more than 20 deaths. The government took minimal steps to bring to \njustice those responsible for the violence. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist \norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border.

I take administrative notice of the information contained in \nthose documents including, but not limited to: \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with an executive presidential system and a \nunicameral 600 seat parliament (the Grand National Assembly). In presidential and \nparliamentary elections in 2018, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nobservers expressed concern regarding restrictions on media reporting and the \ncampaign environment, including the jailing of a presidential candidate that restricted \nthe ability of opposition candidates to compete on an equal basis and campaign freely. \nThe friendship between the United States and Turkey dates back to 1831, when \nthe United States established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. The United \nStates condemned the July 15, 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, and continues to \nemphasize the importance of the Turkish government's adherence to policies and \nactions that build public trust in the country's democratic institutions and the rule of law, \nas well as upholding human rights commitments. Turkey is an important U.S. security \npartner and has been a valued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally since \n1952. \nOn December 14, 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on the Republic of \nTurkey's Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) pursuant to Section 231 of the \nCountering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for knowingly \nengaging in a significant transaction with Russia's main arms export entity by procuring \nthe S-400 surface-to-air missile system. The United States made clear to Turkey at the \nhighest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase of the S-400 system would \nendanger the security of U.S. military technology and personnel and provide substantial \nfunds to Russia's defense sector, as well as Russian access to the Turkish armed \nforces and defense industry. Turkey nevertheless decided to move ahead with the \nprocurement and testing of the S-400, despite the availability of alternative, NATO-\ninteroperable systems to meet its defense requirements. This decision resulted in \nTurkey's suspension and pending removal from the global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \npartnership. \nTurkey continues its efforts to defeat terrorist organizations both inside and \noutside its borders, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Revolutionary \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeople's Liberation Party/Front, and ISIS. Turkey is an active contributor in international \ncounterterrorism, including the GCTF and the Defeat-ISIS Coalition. However, Turkey is \na source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) seeking to join ISIS and \nother terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, as well as for FTFs who seek to depart \nSyria and Iraq. Moreover, the PKK continues to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey and \nagainst Turkish interests outside of Turkey including by taking hostages. \nIn 2020, the PKK and its affiliates claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the \nGurbulak customs gate with Iran that killed two Turkish Customs officials, a suicide \nbomber that struck a natural gas pipeline near the Turkish-Iranian border, taking the \npipeline offline for months, and a bombing in Mardin province that temporarily disabled \nan oil pipeline running from Iraq to Turkey. Turkey has a broad definition of terrorism \nthat includes so-called crimes against constitutional order and internal and external \nsecurity of the state, which the government regularly used to criminalize the exercise of \nfreedom of expression and peaceful assembly. \nSignificant human rights issues exist in Turkey including credible reports of: \narbitrary killings; suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; \ntorture; arbitrary arrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, \nincluding opposition politicians and former members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, \nhuman rights activists, and employees of the U.S. Mission, for purported ties to \n\u201cterrorist\u201d groups or peaceful legitimate speech. There are also \nreports of severe \nrestrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and the internet, including violence and \nthreats of violence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests or criminal \nprosecution of journalists and others for criticizing government policies or officials, \ncensorship, site blocking, and criminal libel laws. \nThe Turkish government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish \nmembers of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses; and \nimpunity remained a problem. The government took limited steps to investigate \nallegations of high-level corruption. Clashes between security forces and the Kurdistan \nWorkers' Party terrorist organization and its affiliates continued and resulted in the injury \nor death of security forces, terrorists, and civilians. The government did not release \ninformation on efforts to investigate or prosecute personnel for wrongful or inadvertent \ndeaths of civilians linked to counterterrorism operations. \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution \nwhen traveling to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups \ncontinue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no \nwarning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local \ngovernment facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting \nand cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Security \nforces have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for \nalleged affiliations with terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and \ngrounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to \ntravel bans that prevent them from departing Turkey. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRomania \nOfficial U.S. Government documents for Romania contained in HE IV included \ninformation from the U.S. Department of State as of January 2024, about the United \nStates' relations with Romania and the current conditions in that country. I take \nadministrative notice of the information contained in those documents including, but not \nlimited to: \nIn 1947, the United States reestablished ties with Romania after World War II. \nRelations remained strained during the Cold War era while Romania was under \ncommunist leadership. After the 1989 revolution ended communist rule, Romania's \npolicies became unequivocally pro-Western. Romania and the United States deepened \ntheir relations and cooperation on shared goals including economic and political \ndevelopment, defense reform, and non-traditional threats such as transnational crime \nand non-proliferation. \nIn 2011, Romania and the United States issued a joint declaration of strategic \npartnership for the 21st century. The two countries identified key areas of enhanced \ncooperation, focusing on political-military relationships, law-enforcement cooperation, \ntrade and investment opportunities, and energy security. In 2016, the two countries \nreaffirmed their commitment to this cooperation. They mutually committed to supporting \nhuman rights, the rule of law, and peace and freedom for everyone. The two countries \nare bound together through people-to-people ties in business, the arts, scholarship, and \nother exchanges. Romania has promoted great cooperation among its Black Sea \nneighbors in the areas of defense, law enforcement, energy, economic development, \nand the environment, which complement the U.S. goal of enhancing stability in this \nsensitive and important region. \nRomania joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and has \nestablished itself as a steadfast ally of both the United States and NATO. It has \nrepeatedly deployed forces and assets in support of shared national security interests, \nincluding contributions of troops, equipment, and other assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq, \nLibya, and Kosovo. \nThe Romanian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the \ngovernment generally respects these rights. An independent press, largely independent \njudiciary, and functioning democratic political system combine to promote freedom of \nspeech and press. \nHuman rights problems include police and gendarmerie mistreatment and \nharassment of detainees. Prison conditions remain harsh and do not meet international \nstandards. Government efforts to address systematic corruption continue, but corruption \nremains widespread. There are no reports that the government or its agents committed \narbitrary or unlawful killings. There are no reports of politically motivated \ndisappearances.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant's family members and foreign contacts are vulnerable to \ncoercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or \nfriend is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence collection operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nApplicant's two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. His eldest brother has \ntwice been the target of terrorism by anti-U.S. militants. Applicant's connection to his \nIraqi family members residing in Iraq presents a potential conflict of interest. The \nadministratively noticed country conditions in Iraq, such as terrorism, civil unrest, and its \nhuman-rights record, raise these security concerns to the level of a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and in-laws are citizens of Iraq residing in Romania. While \ncountry conditions in Romania may not raise security concerns to the level of a \nheightened risk, his relationships with his wife and in-laws living in Romania create a \npotential conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws reside part-time in Turkey, which also creates a potential \nconflict of interest. Additionally, his father-in-law was a high-ranking member of the Iraqi \nmilitary with a close connection to the Iraqi Defense Minister. While Turkey has been a \nlongtime friend to the United States with shared interests in counterterrorism, there is \nalso a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion associated with that country given its human rights violations and the terrorist \nactivity that occurs within its borders. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife, brothers, and in-laws is sufficiently close to \nraise a security concern about his desire to assist them by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. As a matter of common sense and human experience there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. Application of the AG is not a comment on an applicant's \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family \nmember. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009)). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nRomania is an ally of the United States and a member of NATO. There is no \nevidence that it attempts to obtain classified or sensitive information from the U.S. While \nRomania\u2019s human rights record is not spotless, its constitution and laws guarantee \nbasic human rights and personal freedoms. I find that it is unlikely that Applicant\u2019s wife \nwill cause Applicant to be put in a position of having to choose between the interests of \nthe U.S. and Romania. AG \u00b6 8(a) fully applies to Applicant\u2019s Iraqi wife residing in \nRomania. I find the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a for Applicant. \nCountry conditions in Iraq raise security concerns to the level of a heightened \nrisk. Applicant has two brothers in Iraq with whom he maintains close and frequent \ncontact. One of these brothers was known to anti-U.S. militant forces and was twice \ntargeted because he assisted the U.S. during the Iraq War. While Applicant does not \ncurrently own any property in Iraq, his potential future inheritance rights involve \nsubstantial property interests there. He has some family here and other ties to the \nUnited States, such as owning real property, but I do not find that those ties are greater \nthan the bonds he has with his brothers. I find that he has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply with respect to his \nbrothers in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s close and continuing relationship with his in-laws emanates from his \nrelationship with his wife. Country conditions in Turkey raise security concerns to the \nlevel of a heightened risk. While Applicant\u2019s in-laws only reside there for a few weeks \nper year, they consistently do so to maintain their legal residency in Turkey despite also \nresiding in Romania. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was a high-ranking officer in the Iraqi \nArmy until 2017. Given these considerations, I cannot find that it is unlikely that \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his in-laws is so casual that it is unlikely that he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of his in-laws and the interests of \nthe United States. I also cannot find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. While circumstances may \nchange in the future for Applicant if certain family members relocate to the United \nStates, I cannot decide this matter based upon those possibilities. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",
