Keller, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing. On June 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  Department Counsel cross-appealed.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is not\nsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel cross-appealed on the issue of whether the\nJudge\u2019s finding favorable to Applicant on one of the allegations in the SOR was contrary to the\nrecord evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor went to Applicant\u2019s work station on one occasion and observed\nApplicant sitting at his desk, preparing to fill a syringe with an unknown substance from a vial.\nApplicant stated to the supervisor that the substance was an antibiotic prescribed to treat an injury.\nThe supervisor asked Applicant to produce a copy of the physician\u2019s prescription to confirm\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  Applicant never produced the prescription and changed his explanation\nseveral times regarding why he could not produce the prescription.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor\ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s responses concerning the workplace incident were not credible, and he\ndecided to terminate Applicant.  The termination process proceeded with an effective date four days\nafter the creation of a memorandum of record indicating the termination decision and discussing\nApplicant\u2019s right to request a review by a division chief.  There is no record evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nacknowledgment of receipt of the written termination memo.  Applicant met with the division chief\nand provided results from a drug test that were negative.  The termination proceeded however.  A\nfew hours before the termination became effective, Applicant resigned his position.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in December 2004.  He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto Question 20 concerning his employment record in the past seven years.  He did not acknowledge\nthat he had quit a job after being told he would be fired or that he left a job for other reasons under\nunfavorable circumstances.  In March 2006, Applicant was interviewed as part of a security\nclearance investigation.  When questioned during the interview, Applicant did not report anything\nabout the syringe and vial incident and did not disclose that he had been terminated by his former\nemployer.  The interviewing agent asked Applicant if he had been fired or resigned under adverse\nconditions, and he said \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant was interviewed by another agent in 2007.  That agent\nconfronted Applicant specifically about the syringe and vial incident.  Applicant claimed he did not\nknow anything about such an incident.  Applicant also denied that he was going to be terminated.\nIn 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories.  He stressed that he did not use illegal drugs\nor abuse legal drugs.  He added that he was certain that he intended to quit his prior job and that is\nwhy he did not discuss being fired earlier.  At the hearing, Applicant denied all allegations.  He did\nnot recall any incident with a syringe and vial and stated that he never received a notice of\ntermination.  He did not recall any meeting with his supervisor where he was told he would be\nterminated for inappropriate behavior.\n\n3\nThe Judge concluded that the government established by substantial evidence the fact that\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor told Applicant that he would be terminated for inappropriate behavior.  The\nJudge concluded that Applicant deliberately falsified a material fact with his response on the 2004\nsecurity clearance application.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions are contrary to the manifest weight\nof the evidence.  He states that evidence of his good character and professionalism must be taken into\nconsideration and that the credibility of government witnesses is suspect.  He states that the evidence\nsupports the conclusion that he resigned his position solely for personal reasons.  Applicant also\nasserts that many of the facts brought out in the testimony of government witnesses occurred after\nthe fact and without his knowledge.  Therefore, Applicant claims he could not have answered\nQuestion 20 of the security clearance questionnaire untruthfully.\nAn Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  There was a sufficient evidentiary\nbasis for the Judge to accept the supervisor\u2019s testimony that he saw Applicant with a syringe and vial\nat his work station and to accept the supervisor\u2019s testimony that Applicant\u2019s explanations for his\nbehavior were evasive and contradictory.  Regarding the falsification allegation, although the Judge\nwas required to consider Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why he answered security clearance\napplication Question 20  the way he did, she was not required to accept those explanations.  A case\ninvolving alleged falsification requires a Judge to make a finding of fact as to an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the alleged falsification occurred.  As a practical matter, a finding regarding\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but\nrather may rely on circumstantial evidence.  It is not mere speculation or surmise for a Judge to make\na finding of fact about an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind based on circumstantial evidence.  To\nthe contrary, it is legally permissible to do so.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0601 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nSep. 21, 2001).  In this case, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s favorable character references and\nprofessional background when evaluating the plausibility of Applicant\u2019s claim that he did not answer\nQuestion 20 with an intent to deceive.  She noted that, even if the underlying allegations concerning\nApplicant\u2019s possible on-the-job illegal drug use are not true, and regardless of whether he received\nformal written notice of termination, an honest answer to Question 20 would require that Applicant\nlist the incident on the security clearance application and explain the situation.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions in this regard are sustainable on this record.  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).\nDepartment Counsel cross-appealed on the issue of the Judge\u2019s finding that the evidence\nfailed to establish falsification on the part of Applicant based on the manner in which he answered\nthe interviewing agent\u2019s questions in 2006.  Department Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s findings\nand conclusions on this allegation were contrary to the weight of the evidence.  Given the Board\u2019s\n\n4\nresolution of the issues presented by Applicant on appeal, it need not address the assignment of error\nproffered by Department Counsel.\n\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nUnder this standard, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline\nE is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 55 years old. He is divorced and has no children (Tr. 191). He obtained his undergraduate degree in 1975 from one of the U.S. military academies. After receiving two master\u2019s degrees, he received his Ph.D in computer science and engineering in 1989. He retired from the military at the officer paygrade of O-5 in 1999. He held a top secret security clearance during his military and civilian career.

Keller, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his most recent Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on\nDecember 2, 2004. On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 15, 2008 and answered it on\nthe same day. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge through Counsel.\nI received the case assignment on March 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nApril 6, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 8, 2009. Counsel for Applicant moved for\na continuance. I granted the continuance. An amended notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 2, 2009. The\nJune 24, 2009\n\n1\nW itness testimony was received via video-teleconference and telephone. Counsel for Applicant did not object.\n2\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s Counsel objected to the Government calling Applicant as a witness  based on the\nfact that the Government did not notify Applicant. Applicant\u2019s Counsel did not plan to have Applicant testify\nat the hearing. Applicant had a prepared statement to submit for the record. Department Counsel objected\nand Applicant\u2019s Counsel agreed to have Applicant adopt his prepared statement as testimony. Department\nCounsel was then given the opportunity to cross-examine Applicant (Tr. 146-150). \n2\ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which were received without objections.\nThe Government called three witnesses.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  He\n1\n2\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through L, without objections. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nOn June 1, 2009, Counsel for Applicant requested a waiver of the scheduled\nhearing. Applicant wished to submit the matter based upon written documents (in\nessence a review on the record or FORM). Department Counsel objected to Applicant\u2019s\nrequest based on timeliness. I denied Applicant\u2019s request.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c\nof the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility\nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant is 55 years old. He is divorced and has no children (Tr. 191). He\nobtained his undergraduate degree in 1975 from one of the U.S. military academies.\nAfter receiving two master\u2019s degrees, he received his Ph.D in computer science and\nengineering in 1989. He retired from the military at the officer paygrade of O-5 in 1999.\nHe held a top secret security clearance during his military and civilian career. He has\nbeen with his current employer since 2004 (GE 7).\nApplicant held civilian research positions on various military installations from\n1999 until 2002 after his lengthy military career (GE 2). In 2003, he was working as a\nsenior research scientist at a military base. He was, at the time, a probationary\nemployee in federal service (GE 6). \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor determined that Applicant displayed inappropriate\nbehavior in the workplace in November 2003, when the supervisor observed Applicant\nin his office sitting at his desk preparing to fill a syringe with an unknown substance from\na vial (Tr. 33). Applicant\u2019s supervisor was surprised and questioned Applicant. He asked\nApplicant if he was a diabetic and Applicant stated that he had an antibiotic and was\npreparing to inject it. Applicant had banged his head a week before and had a bandage\non his forehead (Tr. 33). Applicant had a tumor removed years ago and said that when\n\n3\nhe sustained a cut, he had to take antibiotics to avoid an infection (Tr. 34).  He further\nexplained that he had received the antibiotics and the syringe from the military medical\nunit (Tr. 37).\nThe supervisor conferred with his deputy who is a physician and was told that\nthis did not make sense. Since this involved a medical issue and possible privacy\nconcerns, the supervisor checked with a personnel specialist about what he could\nlegally ask Applicant. After that, the supervisor asked Applicant for a copy of the\nprescription to confirm Applicant\u2019s explanation for the syringe and vial. (Tr. 38).\nApplicant never produced a prescription and he changed his explanation several times\n(Tr. 41). \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor met with him and determined that his responses\nconcerning the November 2003 incident were not credible and decided to terminate him\n(Tr. 48). The deputy was also at the meeting. Applicant\u2019s supervisor prepared a\nmemorandum of record (GE 4) discussing the incident which told Applicant about his\nright to request a review by the division chief (GE 4). The memorandum was dated\nDecember 15, 2003 and the effective date of termination was December 19, 2003. The\nsupervisor did not have a written acknowledgment of the termination (Tr. 52) and he\nacknowledged that he had never terminated anyone before this incident. He also\nacknowledged that it was possible that Applicant did not take the memorandum with him\nwhen he left the meeting (Tr. 82).\nThe Memorandum - Subject- Termination During Probationary Period, dated\nDecember 15, 2003 refers to \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d as a basis for termination.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor elaborated in the memorandum that Applicant\u2019s responses and\nexplanations to requests and questions have not been credible. He states that \u201cthe\ninference, I have drawn is that the substance in the vial I observed on 20 November\n2003 was non-prescription, and inappropriate\u201d(GE 4). \u201cThis behavior has resulted in a\nlack of confidence and trust ... and serves as the basis for termination during your\nprobationary period.\u201d\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified that when he walked into\nApplicant\u2019s office, Applicant put the syringe and vial in his left hand and lowered them\nout of view (Tr. 35). Applicant\u2019s supervisor acknowledged that he wrote the\nmemorandum of record, which was merged with other information from Personnel. He\nfurther explained that he met with Applicant and explained to him that he was being\nterminated since he did not provide documentation concerning the syringe and the vial\n(Tr. 47). Applicant\u2019s supervisor did not see the final paperwork that Applicant signed.\nTherefore, the supervisor did not write or provide any \u201cremarks\u201d to indicate additional or\nconflicting reasons for Applicant\u2019s resignation ( Tr. 63-64).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor knew that the division chief had the authority to override\nhis decision. He learned later from the division chief that Applicant met with him and\nprovided results from a drug test that showed he was not using drugs (hair sample).\nHowever, the termination proceeded. Applicant\u2019s supervisor also admitted that until a\n\n4\nfew days ago he did not know that Applicant had resigned a few hours before being\nterminated (Tr. 47).  \nApplicant signed an SF 52 (Request for Personnel Action) on December 19,\n2003. The Request For Action is Resignation and Applicant listed \u201cPersonal Reasons\u201d\nfor the resignation (GE 5). Under Part F (Remarks) directly below his signature he\ncorrected his forwarding address with his initials. The Agency Finding was directly below\nthat line and stated: Employee resigned after receiving written notice on 15-DEC-2003\nof termination during probationary period for inappropriate behavior (GE 5). An SF 50\n(Notification of Personnel Action) confirms a resignation for personal reasons and also\nlists the Agency Finding of resignation after receiving written notice of termination during\nprobationary period for inappropriate behavior (GE 6).\nApplicant\u2019s work performance was very good and there were no problems with\nsecurity breaches. His supervisor testified that he hired Applicant and had respect for\nhim (Tr. 70). He had not seen any erratic behavior before the November 2003 incident.\nOn December 2, 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 20 concerning his employment record in the past seven\nyears. He did not acknowledge that he had \u201cquit a job after being told [he would be] fired\nor that he left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances. \nIn March 2006, a special agent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninterviewed Applicant (GE 10). She prepared a report of the investigation. She testified\nat the hearing that Applicant when questioned during the interview did not report\nanything about a syringe and vial and his former supervisor (Tr. 92). Applicant did not\ndisclose that he had been terminated in 2003. He did state that he had not used illegal\ndrugs and that his former supervisor had made allegations concerning illegal drug use\n(Tr. 100). The agent also reviewed Question 20 with Applicant concerning previous\nemployment (Tr. 111). She explained that she asked him if he had been fired or\nresigned under adverse conditions and he said \u201cno\u201d (Tr. 114).\nIn 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a field agent. She prepared a report\nconcerning the investigation. Agent B testified at the hearing that she confronted\nApplicant specifically about the November 2003 incident that his supervisor described\nconcerning a syringe and a vial. Applicant claimed that he did not know anything about\nsuch an incident (Tr. 137). He denied that he was going to be terminated and that he\nexplained he was never asked why he left the employment.\nIn 2007, Applicant was investigated for sensitive compartmented information\n(SCI) access (GE 8). Information concerning the November 2003 incident was\nreviewed. Applicant declined to answer an interrogatory explaining the situation (GE 9). \nIn March 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories with a prepared\nstatement and enclosures (GE 10). He commented on the accuracy of the agent\u2019s\ninterviews. He focused on the fact that he presented a negative hair drug screen to his\n\n5\nemployer in 2003. He stressed that he did not use illegal drugs or abuse legal drugs. He\nfurther explained that \u201che was certain that he intended to quit\u201d and that is why he did not\ndiscuss being fired. He admitted that he had no evidence or paperwork to substantiate\nhis recollection. He stressed that he did not have the time or energy to fight \u201cfalse\nobservations, conclusions, statements, or whatever they were\u201d due to his ex-wife\u2019s\ngrave medical condition. He stated that he was willing to take a lie detector test. \nAt the hearing, Applicant did not wish to testify. He adopted his written statement\n(AE K), and answered questions on cross-examination. He again denied all allegations.\nHe did not recall any incident with a syringe or a vial (Tr. 159). He explained that he\nnever received a notice of termination. He had no recollections of any conversations\nwith his supervisor after the first day (Tr 159). When asked if the \u201dfirst day\u201d was\nNovember 13, 2003, he answered that he had no reason to dispute it (Tr. 160). He did\nnot recall any meeting with his supervisor where he was told that he would be\nterminated for inappropriate behavior. He said he looked through his paperwork and he\nhas no copy of the notice of termination (Tr. 161). He did not recall meeting with his\ndivision chief. He did recall that although \u201chis recollection was extremely hazy\u201d, he had\nthe impression that his supervisor was worried about Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use after a\nconversation that took place (Tr. 162). Applicant explained that he had a hair sample\ndone that was negative for drugs. He wanted to resign as soon as possible given the\nallegations. He agreed that he signed the SF 52 but did not see the Agency Finding\nconcerning termination. He testified that he did not recall seeing that line (Tr. 166).\nApplicant stressed that he left the position for personal reasons. \u201cI would have\nleft even if I had been asked to stay in the position\u201d (AE K). By marking \u201cyes\u201d to question\n20 on the security questionnaire, I would have been implicitly admitting that one of the\nconditions was true. By my knowledge at the time, none of the conditions were true\u201d (AE\nK). As regards the first allegation, I deny having in my possession a termination notice\nand I deny knowing of a termination notice\u201d (AE K).\nApplicant testified at the hearing that he had no problems on the job, but he had\nproblems with his supervisor (Tr. 170). He explained that his supervisor made an\nallegation that he was using illegal drugs, and Applicant did not respect his research (Tr.\n170). Applicant stated that he does not have a clear recollection of a conversation but\nwhen he left \u201cthat meeting\u201d he did not know if his supervisor told him he would be fired\n(Tr. 171). When asked about what he wrote in his March 2008 interrogatories\nconcerning his intention to quit as soon as possible, he said he did not want to be\ndelayed by some minimal number of days notification problem. Applicant explained that\nhe was not referring to the termination notice (Tr. 177). When asked again, Applicant\nsaid \u201cno\u201d .. I will leave it at that time. I don\u2019t want to say too much\u201d (Tr. 178).\nApplicant summed up his testimony by stating that he did not know of any\ntermination action against him. \u201cAt the time I resigned, I thought, given the negative\ndrug screen, I\u2019m getting out of here for personal reasons and this situation\u2019s over and\nclosed\u201d (Tr. 193).\n\n6\nApplicant submitted numerous character references (AE A-I). He is described as\na person of high moral character who demonstrates trustworthiness and honesty. He\ntakes his professional and personal duties seriously (AE C). His actions have never\nbeen rash or impulsive (AE F). He is a thoughtful, careful, and painfully honest analyst\noffering his well thought out and truthful views in a respectful but brutally honest manner\n(AE G). A colleague who has known Applicant for five years wrote that \u201cApplicant can\nbe trusted to protect the national security interests of the U.S. and should be granted a\nclearance\u201d (AE L).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n7\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicting that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information is another disqualifying\ncondition; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\n\n8\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\nprofessional, or community standing. \nApplicant completed his 2004 security clearance application. He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto Question 20 concerning his employment record, which asked about leaving prior\nemployment for various reasons, including, after being told he was fired or under\nunfavorable circumstances. I find that he deliberately falsified a material fact with that\nresponse.\nThe Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant\u2019s supervisor\ntold him in November 2003 that he would be terminated for inappropriate behavior\ndespite that Applicant maintained that he never received a notice of termination.\nApplicant by his own acknowledgment stated that there were allegations of illegal drug\nuse by his supervisor. He could not recall a meeting but did not dispute it. He stated that\nhe resigned after that and listed personal reasons on the SF 52. It is not credible that\nApplicant did not see the agency finding on the SF 52 when he signed it and even\ncorrected his address. He is a seasoned professional and sophisticated man. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony did not refute the allegations despite his denials. He could\nnot recall or remember and did not want to say too much. Applicant\u2019s own testimony\nhearing that he believed by presenting the negative drug screen- the \u201csituation is over\u201d\nacknowledges that there were some unfavorable circumstances or allegations. The fact\nthat the allegations may not have been true concerning illegal drug use is not relevant\nfor an honest answer to Question 20. Thus, AG \u00b616(a) applies in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 and 2007 interviews with two agents are not as clear concerning\na deliberate falsification due to the nature of the questioning in the interviews. I find for\nApplicant as to allegation 1.b. Thus, AG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply.\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following conditions could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n\n9\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nI find that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. Applicant has\nconsistently denied all allegations but he has not been forthright and open. He was not\ncredible in his non-recollections at the hearing. Although the incident occurred in 2003\nand the questionnaire was completed in 2004, Applicant has not mitigated the\nfalsification of his security clearance application. He was not credible in his explanations\nconcerning the termination and resignation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has served his country\nadmirably for 35 years. He was a cadet at a military academy and was an officer in the\nmilitary until 1999. He retired as an officer. He obtained his Ph.D. in computer science\nand worked in various research capacities for the military from 1999 until the present.\nHe held a top secret clearance during his military and civilian career. He had no\nproblems with handling classified information.\nApplicant falsified his 2004 security clearance application when he responded\n\u201cno\u201d to Question 20 concerning prior employment. He omitted the fact that he had\nresigned before a termination or at least that he left under unfavorable circumstances.\nThe fact that Applicant admitted that there were allegations of illegal drug use supports\nthe fact that his resignation for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d was not the entire truth. Even if\nallegations were not true, an honest answer would require that Applicant list the incident\nand explain the situation. Applicant\u2019s reliance on the fact that he did not have the notice\nof termination in his paperwork or the fact that he did not recall being told he would be\nfired is not credible, or sufficient to rebut the Government\u2019s case. \n.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\n\n10\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\npersonal conduct.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied .\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

While she recently decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2007 to discharge her\nlong-standing debts, she did not establish which, if any, of the two dozen debts have been\ndischarged.  Even since her business failed in 2002, she developed  many new debts and documented\nno efforts to resolve even minor debts.  Her business failure linked to bad advice does not establish\na defense of special circumstance.  Her reported good performance on the job is not sufficient to\nestablish how she has reformed or demonstrated positive changes in behavior need to mitigate\nfinancial concerns. Eligibility for a trustworthiness position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\ngrant the application  for a position of public trust under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the\n\"Directive\").    Consequently, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for\n1\nits decision and  alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) in paragraph\n1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\n2\nthe Department of Defense, to be effective September 1, 2006. Applicant responded to these SOR\nallegations in a notarized Answer dated December 26, 2006, which DOHA received on January 3,\n2007.  She requested a decision without a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on June 5, 2007, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which\nwas forwarded to her on June 8, 2007.  The Applicant received the FORM on June 15, 2007; in\nresponse she submitted supplementary information on July 1, 2007.  The Department Counsel did\nnot object to her submissions, so they were admitted into evidence as Exhibits A and B.   The matter\nwas assigned to me on July 26, 2007.  Subsequently, after an initial review, I requested Department\ncounsel contact the Applicant and allowed her to submit updated information on her bankruptcy\nfiling.  In response, on August 14, 2007, she submitted Exhibit C, the Notice of Chapter 7\nBankruptcy Case Filing of July 13, 2007, and other documents which were admitted into evidence.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 49 years old, has worked for a defense contractor in State #1 since September 11,\n\n3\n2005, when she completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P).   She is a health care\nfinder.  She stated she had excellent evaluations and attendance.   Earlier, she attended a state\nuniversity in State #2 from 1976 to 1977 but received no degree. She is divorced.  (Answer; Exhibit\n4)\nFinances \nAlthough Applicant revealed only one debt in her SF 85P, investigation revealed a substantial\nnumber of debts.  (Exhibits 5, 6) In her response to the SOR, she explained that she had a business\nas a sole proprietor where she was \u201cmisinformed and ignorant as to how to open a business\u201d and was\n\u201cgiven the wrong advice.\u201d  (Answer)  She explained further that she had been misled by her former\nboyfriend in this business.  She used all of the income to pay for bills, insurance, and had even paid\nher boyfriend\u2019s child support for three children.  The business failed five years ago in 2002.  She\nclaimed to have been \u201ctricked\u201d and that caused the \u201cbreak up of that relationship,\u201d but she could not\nsue him as he had signed nothing.  She could not afford to file for bankruptcy at that time.  However,\nshe has used her financial resources to help support her daughter and her two-year old child.\n(Exhibit A)\nApplicant admitted all of the debts listed to creditors which total $861,710. Her debts include\nthree repossessed car debts in  a $6,154 debt for an auto repossessed in1999 (SOR  \u00b6 1.a.), a $27,912\ndebt for a repossessed leased auto in 2002 (SOR  \u00b6 1.g.), and $7,291 for an auto repossessed in 2004\n(SOR  \u00b6 1.p.) which seem unlikely to be business-related debts. Her other debts range from small\nconsumer debts which she documented no efforts to pay to numerous other large debts and\njudgments detailed in the SOR.   Her financial problems continued to April 2006 when a $69,028\ndelinquent account (SOR  \u00b6 1.v.) was referred for collection.  In December 2006 she explained she\nplanned to file for bankruptcy, but had not been able to do so earlier as she did not have the money.\n(Answer)   Prior to filing bankruptcy she provided no evidence that she had made arrangements to\npay any of the debts. \nShe paid a $1,700 fee in December 2006 to a bankruptcy firm.  (Exhibit B)  In July 2007 she\nstated that she planned to see her attorney to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and had taken a\nrequired credit counseling course.  (Exhibit A)  Her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was filed on July 12,\n2007; and a meeting of creditors was scheduled for August 15, 2007.  (Exhibit C)  However, she\nfailed to provide any documentation as to which creditors were included in the bankruptcy and\nwhich, if any, of her debts were discharged. \nIn her Answer she disclosed she has a net monthly income of approximately $1,700 and\nmonthly expenses of $1,300 which leaves her a balance of over $400 each month; however, beyond\nstating that she lives within her means, she did not explain how she planned to resolve these debts\nother than to file for bankruptcy.  She moved to a less expensive apartment to reduce her expenses.\nShe drives a 1997 vehicle that she owns.  (Answer)\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\n\n      Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n3\n      Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n4\n      Id.\n5\n      Id.\n6\n      Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n      Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n      ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n9\n      Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n10\n4\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n3\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life\nto make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  \n4\nAn administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully\nweigh the available, reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider\n5\nthe following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n6\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n7\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n8\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n9\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n10\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n       Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e) potentially apply:\n11\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\n5\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n \u00b6 18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by\nknown sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflected\nby her accumulating over $861,000 in debts that have persisted from 1999 to 2006. While she\nclaimed that several of the debts were linked to her failed business, she did not explain exactly how\nany of the debts were business debts.  Included are three repossessed car debts in 1999 (SOR  \u00b6 1.a.),\nin 2002 (SOR  \u00b6 1.g.), and  in 2004 (SOR  \u00b6 1.p.)  which seem unlikely to be business-related debts.\nWhile the majority of her debts are large debts and judgments to financial institutions which may be\nlinked to her failed business, she also has a series of small debts of $192 (SOR \u00b6 1.m.), $53 for cable\n(SOR \u00b6 1.n.),  $55 for a wireless phone (SOR \u00b6 1.q.), and $53 to a department store (SOR  \u00b6 1.t.):\nit seems unlikely that those debts relate to her failed business.  Nor did she document any efforts to\nresolve even these minor debts.  Since her business failed in 2002, she did not explain how the most\nrecent debt of $69,028, referred for collection in April 2006, (SOR  \u00b6 1.v.) is linked to her failed\nbusiness.  Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a),\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation  to overcome the case against her.  In large part,\n11\nApplicant claims that her debts grew out of a failed business, but she did not link any of these\nspecific debts to the business. While she claims that many of  her debts were due to conditions\nbeyond her control, she did not establish that link clearly.  Applicant did take some action and gave\na fee to a lawyer to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in December 2006; however, he did not file until\nJuly 2007.  While her debts may ultimately be discharged under Chapter 7, she provided no evidence\n\n      The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue\n12\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some\nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not\ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence,\nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than\nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order\nto claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n6\nas to which debts to which creditors were included in her filing.  She showed unsound judgment in\nher delay in addressing these serious financial issues, so she did not establish she acted in good\nfaith.   Thus, she fails to meet AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\n12\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  Indeed the evidence suggests she continued to\ndevelop new debts even beyond the time that her business failed in 2002.  In order to establish that\nher business failed due to special circumstances, she would have to provide a clearer explanation.\nWhile Applicant stated she had received counseling in a course that the Bankruptcy court\nrequires for these financial problems, she did not provide the certificate. Nor did she explain how\nthe counseling has led her to improve her financial practices  She failed to establish the clear steps\nshe has taken to turn around her long-standing financial issues. Overall, Applicant failed to establish\nmitigation as her decision to file for bankruptcy is too recent and she provided no evidence as to\nwhich debts might have been discharged.  An applicant must do more than merely show that she\nrelied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of the \u201cgood\nfaith\u201d mitigating condition.\nWhole Person Analysis\nEvaluating Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I conclude she is a sincere\nperson who lived through difficult circumstances.  However, she failed to demonstrate any initiative\nto develop a solution to her large and long-standing delinquent debt.  She even delayed filing for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 from December 2006 to July 2007, so she did not establish that any of\nthe debts alleged in the SOR have been discharged.  Neither did she show how she has changed her\nfinancial practices other than moving to a place with lower rent.  Beyond her own statements, she\nprovided no evidence to establish her favorable employment history.  Given the persistence of her\nsubstantial financial problems from 1999 to 2006, the likelihood of new debts and related problems\nis high. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.v. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.v.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

She paid restitution. She did not list the dismissed\ncharge on her public trust application in 2005 because she relied on advice from a security employee\npresent during the time she completed the application. She has mitigated the trustworthiness\nconcerns raised under personal conduct concerns. Applicant's eligibility for a trustworthiness\nposition is granted.\n\nThis action is taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated December 27, 2006, included in file at 1.\n2\nGE 1 (Application for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated November, 21 2005) at 1-9.\n3\nId.\n4\nTr. 32-34.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On December 7, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 26, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on\nFebruary 21, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 7, 2007. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted one exhibit that was marked as Government Exhibit (GE) 1.\nApplicant submitted eight exhibits (AE) A-I. The exhibits were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 15,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegation 1.a in her SOR response under Guideline E.   She denied\n2\nallegation 1.b. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 30-year-old woman employed as a supervisor in a position of public trust for\na health insurance company. She graduated from high school in 1996, and received her college\ndegree in 2001.  After college, she worked in the banking field for seven years. She has worked for\n3\nher current employer since November 2005. She is a single mother with one child (aged nine years).4\nWhen Applicant was in college in 2001, she received public assistance for herself and her\nchild. She struggled to support her son. She was concerned that she might be pregnant with another\nchild. On June 19, 2001, she entered a grocery store and took a pregnancy test from the shelf. She\nentered the restroom and used it. She had no intention of paying for it. At the time she had no cash,\nbut she did have a credit card. She was arrested as she was leaving the store.5\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter dated December 19, 2006 at 1.\n6\nTr.8.\n7\nMemorandum from colleague, dated December 14, 2006, included in file.\n8\nId.\n9\nAE B (Annual Performance Evaluation, dated 2005).\n10\nAE F (Performance Feedback, dated 2006).\n11\nAE A (Letters of reference (4) from 2007).\n12\nTr.23.\n13\n4\nApplicant paid restitution to the store and the charge was dropped. Applicant took a required\nclass about petty shoplifting that included watching a video and participating in a group discussion.\nThe district attorney at that time told her that in the future she would not have to list anything on any\napplication forms concerning the dismissed shoplifting charge.6\nOn November 21, 2005, Applicant completed her public trust application form (SF 85 P).\nIn response to Question 16-Your Police Record: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of any offenses(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.) She\nanswered \u201cno.\u201d  She did not list the arrest for shoplifting on June 21, 2001.7\nShe inquired about the intent of the question to the security officer assisting the new hires.\nHe advised her after hearing about the shoplifting incident and the dismissal that he did not think it\nwould be a problem not to list it. He further explained that if any further information was needed she\nwould be contacted.  She also believed since the charge was dismissed it did not have to be reported.\n8\nApplicant was one of approximately 30 new employees completing the public trust\napplication. She provided a statement of another new employee who verified that Applicant\nspecifically inquired about the shoplifting charge.9\nApplicant has an excellent employment record.  She received several shining star awards.\n10\nHer annual performance rating is above average.  As a team leader she received excellent reviews.\n11\nAll her evaluations exceeded expectations. Her colleagues praise her ability to accomplish projects\nin a timely fashion.  She served as a mentor to several new employees in the company.\n12\n13\nApplicant regrets making the mistake in June 2001. She realizes it was stupid and wrong. She\nlearned her mistake and believes in a strong work ethic. She progressed in her career field and is now\na supervisor with an excellent work history. She is more mature and lives in a stable environment.\nShe is a responsible parent, earning a sufficient salary to support her son. \nPOLICIES\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Id.\n17\n5\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). The adjudicative guideline at issue in\nthis case is: \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability\nto protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nany other failure \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n15\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n16\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n17\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n21\n6\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.18\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\n19\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to\n20\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access\n21\nto sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline E of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested for\nshoplifting on June 19, 2001, and did not disclose the dismissed charge. This raises Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b616 (c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information).\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Personal\nConduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b616 (a), (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). Applicant\u2019s shoplifting of the pregnancy test was almost seven years ago. It was an isolated\nincident. The charge was dismissed and Applicant paid restitution. Applicant completed her required\nclass concerning the charge. Her circumstances are quite different today. She is a supervisor earning\na good salary and is a responsible parent. Thus, this mitigating condition applies in this case.\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b616 (a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefit status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\n\n7\naward fiduciary responsibilities) is  raised. Applicant deliberately omitted the information concerning\nthe 2001 shoplifting charge because she had legal advice in 2001 and inadequate advice from the\nsecurity personnel when she completed the application.\nShe, in fact, asked the question directly to the security personnel concerning the 2001 dismissed\ncharge. She was told that if further information was needed, she could provide it. Applicant has\npresented mitigating information that is credible concerning the fact she did not deliberately conceal\nor falsify relevant facts from the application form in 2005. Thus, Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17 (b) (the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or\nlegal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance\nprocess. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully) applies. \nThe issue before me is whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigating\nor changed circumstances to warrant a favorable trustworthiness determination. I find that Applicant\nhas presented such information and mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline E.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Applicant has an exemplary work history. Her incident of shoplifting occurred more\nthan six years ago. She learned her mistake and has lived responsibly in all areas of her life. Applicant\ndid not deliberately falsify her public trust application. Applicant\u2019s evidence indicates that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nEligibility is granted.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a determination of trustworthiness and eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties.

On November 25, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued John and Mary separate Statements of \nReasons (SORs) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence), E \n(personal conduct), and F (financial considerations).1 The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nJohn and Mary answered their respective SORs on December 19, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed for both their cases on February 25, \n2010. These cases were previously assigned to two other administrative judges on \nMarch 4, 2010 and April 19, 2010, respectively, until they were reassigned to me on \nMay 25, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2010, scheduling their joint \nhearing for June 24, 2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1(c) through 18(c) for John, \nwhich were received without objection. The Government offered GE 1(m) through 13(m) \nfor Mary, which were received without objection. John and Mary offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 15, which were received without objection, and they testified on \ntheir own behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, I requested each party submit written \nclosing arguments. Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument was marked as Ex. III and \nCounsel for the Applicant\u2019s closing argument was marked as Ex. IV. DOHA received the \nhearing transcripts (Tr.) on July 2, 2010. (Tr. 18-22.) \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted two separate Requests for Administrative Notice \nfor John and Mary, (Exhibits (Exs.)) I and II, requesting that I take administrative notice \nof the summary of facts contained in Exs. I and II, as well as those facts contained in \nthe attachments to Exs. I and II. Without objection from the Applicants, I took \n \n1 On March 1, 2010, the Applicants requested to have a joint hearing, which I granted.  \n\n3 \n \nadministrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which pertained \nto Columbia. (Tr. 11-13.)  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \nGovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nColumbia were derived from Exs. I and II as contained infra under the subheading \n\u201cColumbia\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nJohn admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i., 2.a., 3.a. and 3.b.; and denied 2.b. Mary \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j., 2.a., 3.a. and 3.b.; and denied 2.b. Their admissions \nand denials were accompanied with explanations. Their admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nAs a starting off point, I find John and Mary to be credible witnesses. \nFurthermore, they are decent and honorable, hard working, productive members of \nsociety, responsible parents, and loyal U.S. citizens. Nothing that follows is meant to \ndetract from those findings. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nJohn is the 60-year-old founder and president of a company specializing in \ncomputer and network security. He has held that position since December 1985. (GE \n1(c), Tr. 23-25.) John graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science Degree in \ncomputer science and three minors in math, chemistry, and physics in November 1973. \n(GE 1(c), SOR Response, Tr. 26.) John\u2019s company works on Government-related \nclassified projects. He seeks to retain his top secret clearance, which is required for him \nto continue participating in classified Government contracts. John has successfully held \na clearance since 1997. (GE1(c), Tr. 25-26, 29, 180, 251, 255.) \n \n \nMary is the 62-year-old corporate secretary of the company her husband, John, \nfounded. She has held that position since December 1985. (GE 1(m), Tr. 283-284.) At \npresent, her position with their company does not involve any significant duties. Rather, \nfor the past two and one-half years, she has been employed full-time by an \ninterdenominational Bible study group. (Tr. 283-284.) Mary graduated from the same \ncollege as her husband with a Bachelor of Science Degree in chemistry in November \n1971. (GE 1(m), Tr. 284.) Like her husband, she seeks to retain her top secret \nclearance, which is required for her to continue participating in classified Government \ncontracts. Mary has successfully held a clearance since \u201cthe 90s.\u201d (GE 1(m), Tr. 285, \n298.) \n\n4 \n \n \nJohn and Mary married in June 1971. (GE 1(c), GE 1(m).) They had three sons. \nTheir oldest son is 32, their second son is 27, and their third son died in a rock climbing \naccident when he was 19. Their oldest son is married and has a young child. (Tr. 176-\n177, 251-252.) \n \n \nThe rather complex and purported facts that precipitated SORs being issued \nagainst John and Mary began in approximately 1996. At that time, John and Mary\u2019s \ncompany was doing quite well. They were well established and respected members of \ntheir community and active in their local church. It was through their church that they \nmet Pablo. At the time, Pablo, his mother and sister were living in the same community \nas John and Mary. Pablo held dual citizenship with the United States and Columbia and \nhad two names \u2013 his Columbian name and his Israeli name. Pablo claimed to be an heir \nto a very wealthy banking family and that he was 109th in the lineage to be the King of \nIsrael. He further claimed that he was linked to the Rothschild family fortune and that he \nwould inherit billions of dollars upon his grandfather\u2019s death. Pablo also claimed that his \nfamily disinherited him because he converted to Christianity, but believed that he would \nstill receive his grandfather\u2019s inheritance. When Pablo\u2019s grandfather died in the 1990\u2019s, \nhe did not receive his anticipated inheritance, and Pablo later claimed he would receive \nthe inheritance when he turned 40. (GE 3(c), Tr. 181-182, 190.) \n \n \nPablo also told John that his grandfather served as an ambassador for a South \nAmerican country to several nations and died in the 1990s. Pablo\u2019s grandfather had \npurportedly left him codes to banks at different locations around the world. Pablo \nclaimed to have \u201ccracked\u201d one bank code and retrieved \u201ca bevy of documents . . . like \nthe documents that talked about the family funding the Marshall Plan.\u201d (Tr. 183-185.)  \n \n \nIn addition to befriending John and Mary, Pablo also befriended a number of \nwealthy church members. Having gained their trust and confidence, Pablo convinced \nthem to invest in the Foreign Certificate. The Foreign Certificate was purportedly \nconnected to Pablo\u2019s family wealth. John and Mary did not invest in the Foreign \nCertificate. Pablo\u2019s purpose in seeking money from investors was to cover the fees \nassociated with acquiring the Foreign Certificate. Once acquired, Pablo represented to \nthe investors that he would sell the Foreign Certificate to his family for a big pay-off. The \ncollective amount of money the church members invested with Pablo was approximately \n$1 million. All of the church members lost all of the money they invested with Pablo. (GE \n3(c), Tr. 186-187.) \n \n \nPablo was associated with Fabian, an attorney in the Midwest, and several other \nindividuals to sell the Foreign Certificate. In June 1998, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) filed a complaint and obtained emergency injunction relief in the \noffer and attempt to sell forged and fictitious securities, i.e. the Foreign Certificate. The \nSEC alleged in its complaint that since at least March 1997, the defendants (Fabian and \nPablo, et al) had been engaging in a scheme to obtain money through the offer of \nfraudulent securities. The purported issuing bank for the Foreign Certificate, as well as \nthe FBI and the Federal Reserve, among others, confirmed that the certificate is a \nworthless, sham document. The named defendants were alleged to have been part of a \nfraudulent scheme to use the Foreign Certificate to obtain millions of dollars in \n\n5 \n \npayments for themselves, while invoking both humanitarian goals and the names of \nofficial entities, ranging from the Federal Reserve to the United Nations Security \nCouncil, in an effort to make their scheme appear legitimate. (AE 4(c), AE 6(c).) \n \n \nIn October 1998, the presiding judge (PJ) entered a default judgment against \nPablo in an SEC action involving the offer and attempt to sell the Foreign Certificate. \nThe final judgment ordered Pablo to pay a $75,000 penalty, and permanently enjoined \nhim from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 \nand Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The PJ noted that Pablo had previously \nconsented to the entry of a preliminary injunction against him in June 1998. (AE 5(c), \nAE 6(c).) The PJ described the Foreign Papers utilizing Fabian\u2019s testimony: \n \n[Fabian] has described the [Foreign Certificate] in various ways at various \ntimes. [Fabian] told officials of the Bureau of Public Debt that the \nJapanese government had given the Certificate to [a former president of a \nLatin American country] for \u201cgood services rendered.\u201d (citations omitted.) \nDuring initial testimony before the SEC, Fabian stated that the Certificate \nwas \u201cpart of the debt settlement of the de[b]t Japan owed after World War \nII.\u201d (citations omitted.) According to a so-called \u201cConfidential Review,\u201d \nseemingly written and in any event expressly adopted by [Fabian], the \nCertificate was \u201cfor the purpose of Economic Aid, Economic Stabilization \nand Economic Development around the Globe.\u201d (citations omitted.) At his \ndeposition, [Fabian] testified that the aid, stabilization and development \nplan was developed by an entity known as the \u201cInternational Defense \nAssociation\u201d (\u201cIDA\u201d), which [Fabian] described as a cooperative effort of \nUnited States and Soviet intelligence agencies facilitated by the Catholic \nChurch and conceived by extraterrestrials from planet XV-9 which, \n[Fabian] states, is also known as \u201cAtlantis.\u201d (citations omitted.) (GE 7(c), p. \n3.) \n \n \nIn February 2000, the same PJ entered summary judgment against Fabian, et al. \nFabian was ordered to pay a $200,000 penalty, the maximum penalty allowed, and \npermanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. The PJ \ndescribed the purported holding history of the Foreign Certificate as claimed by Fabian \nand his wife: \n \nThe Holding History is a long, rambling, often incoherent statement that \ndiscusses, among others, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Senator \nEdward Kennedy, and former President Richard Nixon. The Holding \nHistory purports to provide \u201ccertain Classified data which is essential\u201d for \nunderstanding \u201cthe history as it relates to the Certificate and Account and \nits relation to how financial markets were/are created, maintained and \ncontrolled.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 6.) \n \n \nOne of the most significant findings the PJ made in his decision was, \u201cThe \n[Foreign Certificate is a forgery.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 3.) He added, \u201cThe [Fabians] know the \nCertificate is a forgery.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 4.) \n\n6 \n \n \nPablo had told John that the Foreign Certificate had to go through a \u201cvalidation \nprocess\u201d to determine that it was \u201cvalid or not, whether [it was] fraudulent.\u201d (Tr. 52.) \nPablo was insistent that the Foreign Certificate go through the validation process at \nwhich time Fabian \u201cdecided on his own to circumvent [Pablo], to forge his signature, to \ntake the document out of safekeeping, and to try to pursue it on his own.\u201d (Tr. 52.) \nAccording to Pablo, \u201c. . . [Fabian] threatened [Pablo\u2019s] life, to the extent that [Pablo] who \nhad been staying with [Fabian] left without even gathering his belongings and eventually \nleft the country, because he felt his life (was) threatened.\u201d (Tr. 52.)  \n \n \nPablo fled to England and hired a solicitor, who according to Pablo, did not \nrepresent him well and he and the solicitor \u201cparted.\u201d (Tr. 53.) The solicitor purportedly \n\u201cstole\u201d $20,000 from Pablo. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) During his purported \nrepresentation by the solicitor, the SEC had served notice on the solicitor that Pablo \nwas to appear at a hearing in the United States. Pablo claims he did not receive notice \nof the hearing and a default judgment was entered against him, discussed supra. (Tr. \n54.)  \n \n \nWhile Pablo was in England, John visited him two times to make his own \nindependent inquiries about Pablo and his involvement with the Foreign Certificate. \nJohn met Pablo\u2019s solicitor and \u201cgot to interview with the CIA person that he was working \nwith.\u201d (Tr. 56.) This former CIA operative purportedly had access to large bearer bonds \nthat could be used for a transaction. Pablo investigated these bonds and determined \nthey were valid. The bonds later \u201cbecame invalid.\u201d One of the bonds was used by the \nCIA operative to secure an apartment shared by Pablo and the CIA operative. This led \nto Pablo and the CIA operative\u2019s arrest by the London police and confiscation of their \nbonds. After one week in jail, they were released and Pablo returned to the United \nStates in November 1998. (John\u2019s SOR Response, Tr. 196-197.)  \n \n \nIn spite of all that had transpired with Pablo, John concluded that Pablo was the \n\u201cvictim\u201d in the Foreign Certificate transaction, that Pablo was trying to pay investors \nback, that he was not a \u201ccrook,\u201d and that he never got his day in court with the SEC. (Tr. \n56.) At this time, John considers Pablo to be \u201cboth a friend and a business person \ndealing with him.\u201d (Tr. 57.) Pablo convinced John to loan him \u201csome money\u201d to retain \ncounsel to \u201cclear up the (SEC) matter.\u201d (Tr. 54.) John did loan Pablo money to retain \ncounsel, but Pablo did not clear up the SEC matter. (Tr. 54, 193-196.) \n \n \nIn July 2002, John discovered Pablo held dual citizenship with the United States \nand Columbia and held passports with both countries. (Tr. 57-58.) Having discovered \nPablo\u2019s dual citizenship, he disclosed this to a Defense Security Service (DSS) \nrepresentative. After extensive consultations with the DSS representative, they \nconcluded there was no foreign influence concern. (Tr. 58-59.) After 2002, John did not \nsee Pablo again until 2006. He does communicate frequently with him by telephone, \nhowever. (Tr. 59-60.)  \n \n \nJohn and Mary frequently see their two sons, daughter-in-law, and \ngranddaughter, all who live in the local area. John has two sisters residing in the United \nStates and has frequent contact with them. John and Mary also remain in frequent \n\n7 \n \ncontact with Mary\u2019s parents. (Tr. 252-254.) John has lived in the same community since \n1983, exercises his right to vote, is current on all of his taxes, and is involved in his \nchurch as an elder. (Tr. 255-256.) \n \n \nPablo became \u201cdesperate to obtain some of the money his grandfather had \npromised him. He knew of 100 million that had been deposited with his supposed \nillegitimate uncle and aunt in Yugoslavia.\u201d (John\u2019s SOR Response.) Pablo was unable \nto conduct business in the United States after the October 1998 SEC default judgment \nagainst him. Taking into account where he purportedly had family contacts and where \nhe might be able to conduct business, he left the United States in approximately 1998 to \ngo to Lichtenstein. Pablo claimed his family was friends with a member of the royal \nfamily and \u201cwell connected there.\u201d (GE 3(c), Tr. 54.) During this time, he had come up \nwith an idea \u201cto produce the security system that would be applicable to banking, and \nhe had great banking contacts, . . . . \u201c (Tr. 55.) \n \n \nOver John\u2019s objections, Pablo left the United States bound for Yugoslavia in \n\u201cearly \u201899\u201d to locate his uncle. John did not expect to hear from him again, but in early \n2000 Pablo asked him for help with his aunt who purportedly was seeking asylum from \nthe Yugoslavian government. In March 2000, John and Mary flew to Vienna to meet \nPablo and drove to Budapest, Hungary, to meet and assist his aunt. While at the United \nStates Embassy in Budapest, John and Mary were informed by Embassy personnel that \nPablo\u2019s aunt was a \u201ccon artist,\u201d who ran a banking scheme to lure investors and steal \ntheir money. During this trip, John, Mary, and Pablo discussed setting up a secure \nbanking system program. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) John, Mary, and Pablo then drove to \nLichtenstein. (Tr. 62.) Through his \u201cconnections,\u201d Pablo arranged a meeting for John \nwith the board of directors at a prominent bank for the purpose of pitching his secure \nbanking system program. (Tr. 62-74, 201-203.)  \n \n \nIn about 2000, John began loaning Pablo significant amounts of money. John \ntestified the cumulative amounts he loaned Pablo were approximately $410,000. (Tr. \n65.) John\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.d. alleges that he provided personal loans totaling approximately \n$25,000 to establish a non-profit organization, and for Pablo\u2019s legal defense against the \n1998 SEC judgment against him. John admits providing approximately $5,000 each to \ntwo friends, who were associated with the non-profit organization for earnest money to \npurchase homes, but he did not provide money to the non-profit organization as alleged. \nJohn acknowledges that he did provide $10,000 to assist Pablo with his SEC legal \ndefense fees. (Tr.199-200, 215-216.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. alleges that in about 2002, John made two separate low interest loans \nof $200,000 each, for a total of $400,000, to Pablo. John made these loans being fully \naware of the 1998 SEC judgment against Pablo, a judgment John believes is \u201cwithout \nmerit.\u201d These funds were loaned to Pablo \u201cto assist in doing the fund-raising for [the \nsecure banking system program].\u201d John loaned these amounts to Pablo knowing that \nhis parent company had only earned about $14,000 in gross income that year. (John\u2019s \nSOR Response, Tr. 67.) SOR \u00b6 1.g. alleges that John transferred about $408,000 from \n2000 to 2006 to Pablo, knowing that his parent company had only earned about \n$148,282 in gross income from 2002 to 2006. Applicant testified that this allegation was \n\n8 \n \nnot a separate sum from the $400,000 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f., but rather referred to the \nsame $400,000. (Tr. 67-68.) In June or July 2002, John travelled to Germany to meet \nwith Pablo and provide him with the first $200,000 loan. In order to provide Pablo with \nthe second $200,000 loan, John had to secure the funds by borrowing the money on his \nlife insurance policy. (AE 3(c), Tr. 213-214.) All told, John loaned money to Pablo \nmoney 39 separate times. The first loan was for $9,000 on March 20, 2000 and the 39th \nand last loan was for $4,600 on December 6, 2006, for a grand total of $408,700.  \n \n \nPablo executed two separate promissory notes for $200,000 in which he \npromised to pay John back. (GE 2(c), GE 13(c), Tr. 219-221.) To date, Pablo has not \npaid John or Mary any of the money loaned to him. Because Pablo lives in Columbia, \nJohn cannot sue him for any funds owed him. John has not had any successful \nventures with Pablo during the 12 years he has known him. (Tr. 222.) In addition to \nvarious church members losing approximately $1,000,000 dollars through their \ninvestments with Pablo in the Foreign Certificate, there were two investors in \nLiechtenstein that lost \u201cabout 300,000\u201d in another venture. As far as John is aware, \nPablo\u2019s \u201cdebt would be contained within $3 million.\u201d (Tr. 265.)  \n \n \nJohn testified Pablo used these funds to live on, to make brochures, to travel and \nset up meetings, and basic business expenses. (Tr. 68.) Pablo was in Liechtenstein \nbecause his grandfather was \u201ca very close friend of [a royal family member].\u201d The royal \nfamily member \u201cwas ready to fund [the secure banking system program], up until the \nfact he found the SEC judgment. Once he found the SEC judgment, the deal fell apart.\u201d \n(Tr. 69.) The SEC judgment against Pablo \u201cdrove the Liechtenstein contacts away and \nPablo concluded his efforts in Liechtenstein were a failure. (Tr. 69.) At that point, Pablo \ndecided to move to Columbia in 2002 where his family was \u201cwell-known\u201d and where he \nhas remained ever since. (Tr. 69-70.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.h. alleged that he formed a Liechtenstein registered trust in 2000 \nfor the purpose of holding intellectual property rights to certain technologies he was \ndeveloping and that, as of August 22, 2009, the registered trust held intellectual \nproperty rights to his technologies. Applicant advised that the registered trust was \nformed by others with \u201csome minor assistance from me.\u201d John, aware of foreign \ninfluence concerns, ensured that he would have no foreign signature authority over the \nregistered trust. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) John disclosed this situation to a DSS \nrepresentative as it occurred. (Tr. 81.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.i. alleged that his parent company, where he serves as president \nwith a 77% interest, had a business relationship with a Liechtenstein company formed \nby the Liechtenstein registered trust referred to above to promote and sell his banking \nsecurity software. The SOR further alleged that this company was formed by the \nregistered trust by Pablo under the laws of Liechtenstein in the 2000 to 2001 timeframe. \nApplicant advised that the business relationship with the company formed by Pablo was \nconducted by a separate subsidiary company, not previously discussed, which provided \nan indirect tie to his parent company. Other companies were also tied to the company to \npromote and sell John\u2019s banking security software while waiting for funding. (John\u2019s \nSOR Response.) John did not have any ownership or financial interests in the \n\n9 \n \nLiechtenstein registered trust. He did not receive any form of compensation from the \ntrust, nor did he have any management authority over the registered trust. (Tr. 81-82.) \nThe success of the Liechtenstein registered trust was \u201cvery much dependent upon the \n[royal family member\u2019s] goodwill and the relationship Pablo\u2019s family had with him, so \nthat was very key, the reasons why Liechtenstein was chosen.\u201d (Tr. 83.)  \n \n \nThe last time John saw Pablo was for two days on October 31 and November 1, \n2006 when he travelled to Columbia to see him. John testified that Pablo has not \nreturned to the United States since he left the United States in 1998. Pablo did not invite \nJohn to his home because he lived in an \u201cunsafe\u201d neighborhood. Rather they met at a \nlocation near the airport. (Tr. 69, 224-226, 264.) John believes that he \u201chas some \nroommates\u201d and is friends with the President of Columbia. (Tr. 71-73, 240-241.) As far \nas John knows, Pablo works at a \u201cminor job (such) as selling real estate and his major \njob is still trying to work with these large antique financial instruments.\u201d At present, \nPablo\u2019s mother and sister live in the same community as John and Mary in a \u201cvery \nmodest\u201d residence. (Tr. 259.)  \n \n \nJohn explained that after the car accident in Columbia where Pablo\u2019s father, \nsister, and two brothers were killed, Pablo\u2019s family tried to kill his mother so they could \nhave young Pablo for themselves and raise him. After a foiled attempt by the family to \nkill her with \u201cbad drugs,\u201d she fled Columbia and moved to the United States. (Tr. 260.) \nAs Pablo grew up, he spent time living with his grandfather \u201cin luxury\u201d and alternatively \nwith his mother \u201cin poverty.\u201d (Tr. 260.) John testified that Pablo is not affiliated with nor \ndoes he work for the Columbian government. John is aware of his obligation to report \nany unauthorized contact by a foreign national and of his responsibilities to safeguard \nclassified information. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \n \nJohn explained why he continued to have faith in Pablo: \n \nWell, you know, as a Christian man, I try to discern how the Spirit is \ndirecting me, and in particular with [Pablo], I\u2019ve asked often whether this \nassociation should continue, and as far as I can discern, as I\u2019ve tested the \nSpirit, that I\u2019m not allowed to leave him. I\u2019ve tried, but it\u2019s \u2013 I cannot leave \nhim without a friend. I mean, most of his friends have deserted him, and \nit\u2019s tough for him. It\u2019s not easy living in poverty in Columbia. \n \nSo even though I would explore possibilities of, you know, disassociating \nmyself with him, I was never allowed to do that in the Spirit. There was \nalways a check in my spirit. (Tr. 88.) \n \n \nThe following is a colloquy between Department Counsel and John regarding his \nongoing relationship with Pablo: \n \nQ. Now, I think you said earlier that you\u2019ve considered severing your ties \nwith [Pablo] but you\u2019re not able to do that? \n \n\n10 \n \nA. Well, you know, I try to pray and, you know, seek God\u2019s direction in all \naspects of my life. And every time I would try to move away from my \nassociation with him (Pablo) I would (get) slapped down, you know, like, \nNo, you don\u2019t do that sort of thing. So, you know, even though I\u2019ve tried \nand, you know, I\u2019ve been very frustrated with him, you know, after July of \n2002, for example, I haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019ve been allowed to sever \nconnections.  \n \nQ. Does your wife want you to sever connections with him? \n \nA. She would prefer me to sever connections with him. \n \nQ. Do you maintain your relationship with him because he owes you \nmoney at all or is it not based on that reason? \n \nA. Well, obviously, there\u2019s some incentive to help him pay back and to pay \nothers back. But I would like to think it was more than that. You know, he\u2019s \n\u2013 last Sunday represented the 44th anniversary of his father, his sister and \ntwo brothers who were killed in an assassination as a truck forced their car \noff of a mountain road in Columbia. And since then it\u2019s been he and his \nmother. And it\u2019s been a tough life for him. \n \nAnd especially after he became a Christian and having all of those \nrelationships severed he\u2019s kind of an orphan out there. And so I have \nsome compassion for him on that standpoint. And if I can help him recover \nI would like to. (Tr. 241-242.) \n \n \nMary, like John, continues to believe in Pablo; however, she does not support \nJohn pursuing further business interests with Pablo. She acknowledged \u201csign[ing] off\u201d \non all of John\u2019s transactions with Pablo. Additionally, Mary testified at a federal grand \njury in 2002 that was investigating Pablo \u201cto track that money.\u201d To the best of Mary\u2019s \nknowledge, nothing came of the grand jury investigation. (Tr. 294-297.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged that John falsified his May 2002 SF-86 by failing to list \nthat he formed a Liechtenstein registered trust for the purpose of holding intellectual \nproperty rights to certain technologies when asked whether he had any foreign property, \nbusiness connections, or financial interests. John discussed the situation with a DSS \nrepresentative and the representative determined that it was not necessary for John to \nlist the Liechtenstein registered trust on his SF-86. John further credibly testified that he \ndid not form the trust, that he never transferred any property to the trust, that he never \nhad any ownership interest in the Liechtenstein registered trust, that he had no control \nover the business affairs of the trust at any point, and that he never had signature \nauthority on any of the trust\u2019s accounts. (Tr. 93-94, 96-100, 228-232.) \n \n \nMary\u2019s SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged that she falsified her May 2002 SF-86 rights by failing \nto list that she and John formed a Liechtenstein registered trust in 2000 for the purpose \nof holding intellectual property rights and that she served as corporate secretary in \n\n11 \n \nJohn\u2019s business and owns 14% of that business; and had a business relationship with a \nsubordinate company to fund and market secure banking system technologies. Mary \ncredibly testified and corroborated her SOR Response that she had no foreign \nproperties, that their subordinate company had pending relationships waiting for \nfunding, and that no intellectual property rights have been transferred. In short, she has \nno interest of any sort in the trust, and that she had no business connections with their \nsubordinate company. Her only involvement in the Liechtenstein registered trust was \nthe potential transfer of intellectual property to the trust at some point. She did not \nparticipate in the forming of the trust, is not a trustee, nor has she ever held a position of \nauthority or responsibility within the registered trust. (Mary\u2019s SOR Response, Tr. 286-\n289.) \n \n \nOn October 8, 2005, John and Mary filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On October \n12, 2005, they notified the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) by \nletter of their bankruptcy filing. (AE 8(c), Tr. 101-102.) John\u2019s business and personal \nincome dropped considerably from 2000 to 2005. As a result of expenses and business \ndropping off, John and Mary\u2019s cash flow was reduced to the point that they took out a \nhome equity line of credit, borrowed against a life insurance policy, borrowed \napproximately $120,000 from Mary\u2019s parents, and live an austere lifestyle as compared \nto their previous lifestyle. (AE 9-15, Tr. 102-122.)  \n \n \nTheir credit reports and financial records over those years show a steady decline \nin their financial situation. John and Mary\u2019s Chapter 7 Summary of Schedules reflected \ntotal assets of $291,781.22 and total liabilities of $380,497.07. They were awarded a \ndischarge in January 2006. (GE 9(c) \u2013 GE 12(c), GE 14(c) \u2013 GE 15(c), GE 16(c).) At \npresent, John and Mary do not have any credit cards and pay cash for everything. They \nare able to meet their monthly expenses through Mary\u2019s salary, and cash gifts from their \nyoungest son and Mary\u2019s parents. John and Mary live a modest lifestyle and are current \non all of their monthly expenses. Taking into account their collective income sources, \nJohn and Mary\u2019s annual income is approximately $68,000. (Tr. 123, 235-237.) John \ntestified that Pablo\u2019s failure to pay back the $400,000 loan was a contributing factor to \nhis filing bankruptcy. (Tr. 228.) \n \n \n \nJohn has never owned any real estate in a foreign country nor has he ever had \nan interest in a foreign bank or investment account. He has no plans to move or retire to \nLiechtenstein or to Columbia. (Tr. 100-101.) Like John, Mary has never owned any real \nestate in a foreign country nor has she ever had an interest in a foreign bank or \ninvestment account. (Tr. 289-290.) \n \n \nJohn testified that Pablo was aware that John and Mary were at a DOHA hearing \nand that their problems with DOHA were caused in large part by their association and \ndealings with him. Pablo\u2019s reaction to the fallout he caused John and Mary is, \u201c[h]e and \nhis family are not happy about that.\u201d To the best of John\u2019s knowledge, none of the \ninvestors to include John and Mary who lost money through their investments with \nPablo has ever been paid back. (Tr. 266-267.) John later discovered that after the SEC \nfound Fabian guilty of securities fraud and fined and issued a permanent injunction \n\n12 \n \n                                                          \nagainst him, his state bar disbarred him. Fabian then killed his wife and two teenage \nchildren and committed suicide in June 1991. (Tr. 267-268.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nThree character witnesses testified on John and Mary\u2019s behalf: (1) a personal \nreference who is a retired Air Force Major General and is now working as an aerospace \nengineer for a defense contractor; (2) a personal reference they met through their \nchurch who retired as the head of an major insurance company\u2019s internal audit \ndepartment and is now working as a maintenance man for the local housing authority; \nand (3) a personal reference they met through their church who is the owner of a small \nresearch and development business. In addition to being personal friends, all three \nwitnesses have been involved in a business relationship with John and Mary in varying \ndegrees. The second witness invested $310,000 from his retirement account in the \nForeign Certificate and lost the entire amount. The collective testimony of these \nwitnesses supports the notion that John and Mary are trustworthy and responsible \nindividuals. (Tr. 34-50, 127-176.) \n \nJohn and Mary also submitted letters from a DSS representative that \ndocumented a seven-year track record from 2001 to 2008 of their company\u2019s \ncompliance with DoD security procedures. Their company earned consistent grades of \n\u201cSatisfactory\u201d during this period. (AE 1-8.) They also submitted a letter dated June 8, \n2000 from the U.S. Department of Commerce that granted them a license to export \ncertain technology to Liechtenstein. (AE 9.) Lastly, they submitted company profit and \nloss statements from 2000 to 2006 that reflected a steady decline in business revenues. \n(AE 9-15.) \n \nColumbia2 \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with a population of \napproximately 44.8 million. Colombia is the second most populous country in South \nAmerica. Any person born in Colombia is considered a Colombian citizen. \n \n \nThe Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to \nColombia. Violence by narco-terrorist groups continues to affect some rural areas and \ncities. The potential for violence by terrorists and other criminal elements exists in all \nparts of the country. Terrorists and other criminal organizations continue to kidnap and \nhold persons of all nationalities and occupations for use as bargaining chips. No one is \nimmune from kidnapping on the basis of occupation, nationality or other factors. U.S. \nGovernment officials and their families have strict limitations on travel to and within \nColombia due to these dangers.  Kidnap or murder victims in Colombia have included \njournalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and business people, as well \nas tourists and even small children. Approximately 298 kidnappings committed by \nterrorist groups and for-profit kidnap gangs were reported to authorities in 2007.  \n \n \n2 The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I and II, which are duplicate \ndocuments. \n\n13 \n \nRobbery and other violent crimes are common in major cities while small towns and \nrural areas can be extremely dangerous due to the presence of narco-terrorists. \n \n \nThe Secretary of State has designated three Colombian groups \u2013 the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), \nand the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) \u2013 as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. These groups have carried out bombings and other attacks in and \naround major urban areas, including against civilian targets. Terrorist groups have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure (e.g., water, oil, gas, and electricity), public recreational \nareas, and modes of transportation. The FARC has targeted civilians, government \nrepresentatives and politicians, soldiers, and the civilian infrastructure. Three Irish \nRepublican Army members assisted in training the FARC on IRA bomb tactics in \nColombia. FARC held three U.S. government contractors -- all U.S. citizens -- hostage \nfor five years, until they were rescued on July 2, 2008 by the Colombian military. Some \nborder areas have become terrorist safe havens. \n \n \nAlthough the government\u2019s respect for human rights continued to improve, \nserious problems remain.  Unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, \ninsubordinate military personnel who collaborate with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, overcrowded and insecure prisons, and other serious human \nrights abuses were reported during 2007. Illegal armed groups and terrorist groups \ncommitted the majority of human rights violations\u2013including political killings and \nkidnappings, forced disappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The UNITED \nSTATES Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \n\n14 \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a \nclearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the \nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \na clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in UNITED STATES \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \n\n15 \n \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of \nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is \nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the \nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative or \nfriend lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative or friend, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nAlthough Pablo is not a relative, there is no question that he is a person with \nwhom John, and to a lesser extent Mary, maintain a close personal and business \nrelationship. Pablo is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Columbia and a resident of \nColumbia. Pablo owes John and Mary over $400,000, an amount they hope to recover \nfrom him. John maintains frequent e-mail and telephone contact with Pablo and has \nvisited him in Columbia. This close relationship creates a potential risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close \nexamination of all circumstances. The Government produced substantial evidence of \nthe three disqualifying conditions under AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and 7(e). Although the \nGovernment alleged that John and Mary traveled to Liechtenstein in 2001 for the \npurpose of conducting business, there is no evidence that the business was of \nconsequence. Furthermore, the Government did not present evidence at the hearing \ndemonstrating or suggesting that John and Mary\u2019s involvement in Liechtenstein was a \nconcern. \n \n\n16 \n \nThe burden shifted to John and Mary to produce evidence and prove mitigating \ncondition(s). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nJohn and Mary are not bound to Pablo as a blood relative or through marriage, \nbut rather through years of friendship and a series of adverse financial dealings. John \nhas demonstrated his close ties with Pablo by frequent contact, his visit to Columbia in \n2006, and professed friendship. Pablo purportedly makes his living selling real estate \nand dealing in financial instruments. From the evidence presented, Pablo is not affiliated \nwith the Columbian government save for his claim to be a friend of the Columbian \nPresident. The record does not identify what influence, if any, the Columbian \ngovernment could exert on Pablo as a result of being a resident citizen of Columbia. \nHowever, Pablo\u2019s presence in Columbia, and John\u2019s foreign travel, professed \nfriendship, and financial dealings creates concerns under this Guideline. As such, the \nburden shifted to John and Mary to show Pablo\u2019s living in Columbia and travel there \ndoes not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cColumbia,\u201d the U.S. Secretary of State has \ndesignated three Columbian groups -- FARC, ELN, and AUC as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. Although the Columbian government\u2019s respect for human rights \ncontinues to improve, terrorist groups operating within Columbia have committed the \nmajority of human rights violations to include political killings and kidnapping, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n\n17 \n \nJohn denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the United States and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the United States was not \nchallenged in this proceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, John has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that \n[his relationship with Pablo in Columbia] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d John\u2019s continued and ongoing relationship with his friend, Pablo, and the \nnature of unlawful activities in Columbia by terrorist organizations places Applicant in \njust this position, given his close relationship with Pablo and Pablo\u2019s continued \npresence and connection with Columbia.  \n \nHowever, John and Mary are able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6 8(a). Pablo \npurportedly maintains a non-political low key position in Columbia. Full application of AG \n\u00b6 8(a) is also precluded given his past SEC judgment and inability to find employment in \nhis profession not to mention the numerous investors, to include John and Mary, who \nplaced their trust and confidence in Pablo and suffered financially. John and Mary\u2019s loss \nin excess of $400,000 directly contributed to their 2005 bankruptcy. \n \nJohn and Mary are able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(b). Their relationship \nwith Pablo in Columbia is minimal when compared and contrasted with their immediate \nrelatives in the United States John and Mary have \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, [they] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.\u201d Their two living sons and \nimmediate relatives are U.S.-born citizens and reside in the United States, and they are \nfully inculcated with U.S. values. John and Mary were born, raised, and educated in the \nUnited States. John and Mary have worked with the U.S. Government as a defense \ncontractor with dedication and distinction for years. John and Mary\u2019s property and \ninvestments are in the United States, and they have no property or investments in \nColumbia or in any other foreign country. They have many friends and colleagues in the \nUnited States. They are loyal, dedicated U.S. citizens, who exercise their rights of U.S. \ncitizenship. John and Mary provided three reputable witnesses, to corroborate their \nloyalty and trustworthiness.  \n \nJohn and Mary are also able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(e) as a result of \ntheir keeping the DSS fully apprised of their association with Pablo and travel to \nColumbia. They have been completely open and forthright with Government officials \nfrom the onset of this affair. John and Mary have no assets in Columbia except two \nvirtually uncollectable promissory notes as opposed to all of their assets being in the \nUnited States. A thorough comparison of their relationship to the United States as \ncompared to their relationship with Columbia is further discussed under the Whole-\nPerson Concept, infra. \n\n18 \n \n                                                          \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the Government\u2019s concern under this Guideline: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately, i.e. knowingly and willfully. An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. 3 \n \n3 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \n\n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of John and Mary\u2019s respective statements \nregarding their foreign holdings. AG \u00b6 17(f), infra, provides a condition that could \nmitigate security concerns in this case, stating, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. \n \nHaving had the opportunity to listen to their testimony and observe their \ndemeanor, their explanations as set forth in the findings of fact are accepted as \ncredible. John and Mary took the extra step of informing a DSS representative regarding \nthe registered trust and after a meaningful discussion concluded that it was not \nnecessary to list foreign holdings as alleged. Furthermore, and based on the evidence, \nJohn and Mary answered the question regarding their foreign holdings truthfully. \nAdmittedly, the relationship that existed between the parties and their respective level of \ninvolvement could understandably lead to confusion.  \n \nHaving dealt with falsification concerns, I now move on to what I view as the crux \nof this case and that is John and Mary\u2019s ongoing relationship with Pablo. This \nrelationship began at John and Mary\u2019s church in approximately 1996. From the onset, \nPablo made some rather extraordinary claims about his very wealthy background, being \nlinked to the Rothschild family fortune, and being in the lineage to the King of Israel. \nPablo, who was born into a Jewish family, claimed that his family disowned him \nbecause he had converted to Christianity, but his grandfather, a former Columbian \nambassador, left him a substantial fortune worth millions. Pablo related that his \ngrandfather had put monies away at various sites.  \n \nRecord evidence identified at least four schemes associated with Pablo. First, \naround 1977 Pablo was involved with the Foreign Certificate, discussed at length, \nsupra. John and Mary did not invest in this particular venture, but fellow church \nmembers did and paid dearly for placing their trust in Pablo. Collectively, they lost \napproximately $1 million. One member, who was the second witness to testify at John \nand Mary\u2019s hearing, lost $310,000 from his retirement account. In June 1998, the SEC \nfiled a complaint against Fabian, Pablo, et al, alleging that the Foreign Certificate was a \nsham document and that Pablo and others were part of a fraudulent scheme to use the \nCertificate to obtain millions of dollars for themselves. The SEC entered a default \njudgment against Pablo ordering him to pay a $75,000 fine and permanently enjoined \nhim from future trading or investing in the United States. \n \nSecond, in 1998 Pablo was arrested in London along with a \u201cformer CIA \noperative\u201d and placed in jail for one week based on their involvement with fraudulent \nbearer bonds. Third, in 2000 Pablo requested that John and Mary assist him in getting \nhis purported aunt asylum from the Yugoslavian government. After traveling to Europe, \nJohn and Mary were informed at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, Hungary that the \n\u201caunt\u201d was a con artist involved in fraudulent banking transactions. Fourth, in 2002, \nPablo told John and Mary that he had $40 million in a security house in Amsterdam. He \nasked to borrow $200,000 from John and Mary to pay a storage fee to the security \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n20 \n \nhouse so that he could access the $40 million. John and Mary loaned Pablo the \n$200,000, but there was no money in the storage house. \n \nDespite their knowledge of Pablo\u2019s involvement in these scams, their knowledge \nof the SEC judgment, and their knowledge of an FBI investigation involving Pablo, John \nand Mary refuse to believe that Pablo is culpable in any of these instances. Instead, \nthey view him as a victim and continue to place their faith in him. In spite of Pablo\u2019s \ntrack record of divesting substantial amounts of money from numerous investors, John \nand Mary decided to go into a business venture with him in 2000. John and Mary \nbelieved that Pablo could help them acquire funding for a secure banking system \ninvented by John. Over the years, John and Mary made 39 separate loans, the first in \n2000 and the last in 2006 for a total of $408,700. Pablo has not repaid one cent of the \nmoney that John and Mary loaned him, nor have they ever had a successful business \nventure with him. The record is void of anyone ever having had a successful business \nventure with Pablo. The record further demonstrates that Pablo has associated with \nquestionable and unsavory characters involved in fraudulent schemes such as his \n\u201caunt\u201d in Yugoslavia and Fabian.  \n \nBefore John and Mary met Pablo, they were financially secure. In 2005, having \ndepleted their savings, they were forced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their \nnumerous loans to Pablo over time placed them in financial jeopardy and directly \ncontributed to their financial instability. Their total liabilities on their Summary of \nSchedules are $380,497.07. It is quite clear that they would not be in their predicament \nhad they not loaned Pablo $408,700. Furthermore, this was not an isolated loan, but 39 \nseparate loans over time. Everyone who invested with Pablo lost all of their investment. \nPablo\u2019s abysmal track record should have served as a red flag. In order to remain \nsolvent today, John and Mary have had to rely on the generosity of their son and Mary\u2019s \nparents. In spite of all this, John and Mary continue to have faith in Pablo and refuse to \nsever their ties with him. They refuse to see him for what he is \u2013 a con artist. This \nsevere error in judgment raises grave concerns about John and Mary\u2019s suitability to hold \nsecurity clearances.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns about his personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n21 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, I find none of the mitigating conditions under this \nconcern applicable to mitigate concerns arising under disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 explains the Government\u2019s concern under this Guideline: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nJohn and Mary\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by their admissions and the \nevidence presented. As noted supra, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October \n2005 and listed $380,497.07 worth of liabilities. Their unsecured nonpriority debts were \ndischarged in January 2006. And, Pablo\u2019s numerous unpaid loans directly contributed to \ntheir filing bankruptcy. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through(e) \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n\n22 \n \n                                                          \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially applicable. Until John and Mary filed for bankruptcy in \n2005, they had maintained financial responsibility. Their credit worthiness and ability to \npay their bills was never an issue. They were making a comfortable living and ran a \nsuccessful business. However, I am unable to give them full credit under this condition \nbecause of the ongoing questionable judgment they exercise vis-\u00e0-vis Pablo, discussed \nsupra, and which played a significant role in their filing for bankruptcy. Concerns remain \nregarding John and Mary\u2019s continued misplaced trust and faith in Pablo. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), John and Mary receive partial credit because the business \ndownturn they experienced was largely beyond their control and they acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. However, their providing numerous loans to Pablo over time \nled to their adverse financial situation and does not demonstrate they acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.4  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable because John and Mary underwent financial \ncounseling in order to complete the bankruptcy process. AG \u00b6 20(d) is partially \napplicable because John and Mary\u2019s debt was discharged following bankruptcy.5 AG \u00b6 \n \n4 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n\n23 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n20(e) is not applicable because John and Mary did not dispute the legitimacy of their \ndebts. \n \nFinancial considerations have a judgment component in the concern that \ncontinues even though John and Mary have no delinquent debts. This judgment \ncomponent is best addressed under Guideline E, supra. I further note that John and \nMary have been and are current on their monthly bills since they were awarded a \nbankruptcy discharge in 2006. Accordingly, I find for John and Mary under Guideline F \nbecause the same conduct is duplicated under both guidelines. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.   \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, \n \n5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Ultimately, the \nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3. \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Columbia. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis. First, three foreign terrorist organizations have been identified by the \nU.S. Secretary of State that are operating within Columbia. Illegal armed terrorist groups \ncommitted human rights violations to include political killings and kidnappings, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Although Columbia \nand the United States enjoy a cordial relationship, the existence these terrorist groups \nand their concomitant internal problems within Columbia remain a concern. Second, \nJohn and Mary\u2019s close friend Pablo lives in Columbia. Pablo has an outstanding SEC \njudgment against him among other concerns. Third, John visited Pablo at least one time \nin Columbia in 2006 and remains in frequent contact with him by e-mail and telephone. \nThese contacts and visit are collective manifestations of strong affection and the regard \nJohn and or Mary have for their friend, Pablo. \n \n \nThere is significant mitigating evidence that weighs towards finding in John and \nMary\u2019s favor with regard to this concern. They were born, raised, and educated in the \nUnited States. They raised their children in the United States. All of their immediate \nfamily members are in the United States. They own real property in the United States, \nare involved in their community, and exercise all rights of U.S. citizenship. Their \nassociation with Columbia begins and ends with their one close friend, Pablo, who lives \nand resides in Columbia.  \n \nJohn and Mary maintain much more frequent contact with their U.S.-based family \nand friends than they do with their friend, Pablo, residing in Columbia. Their ties to the \nUnited States are stronger than their ties to Pablo in Columbia. There is no evidence \nthat John and Mary have ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States.8 They take their loyalty to the United States very seriously, and they \nhave worked diligently for many years as a Government contractor/employer. The \nrecord contains no evidence that John and Mary have conflicted loy\n \n \nI considered the totality of John and Mary\u2019s ties to Columbia. Columbia and the \nUnited States enjoy a friendly relationship. Apart from the internal problems within \nColumbia, which are not endorsed by the Columbian government, Columbia is a \nmultiparty democracy, whose government\u2019s respect for human rights continues to \n \n \n8 The Government does not have the burden of providing such evidence. \n \n\n25 \n \n                                                          \nimprove. There is no evidence in the record to support the notion that the Columbian \ngovernment engages in an adversarial relationship with the United States. \n \n \nIn the unlikely event that John and Mary\u2019s friend, Pablo, in Columbia was \nsubjected to coercion or duress from a terrorist group within Columbia, I find that \nbecause of their deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat they would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nin favor of the United States. Noteworthy and given great weight are John and Mary\u2019s \nlifetime of being loyal U.S. citizens. Lastly, their witnesses provided compelling \nendorsements on their behalf. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that John and Mary may have divided loyalties or act in a way \nadverse to U.S. interests or some attempt may be made to exploit Pablo in such a way \nthat these U.S. citizens would have to choose between their pledged loyalty to the \nUnited States and their friend. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nall the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude John and \nMary have mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nWhile I am able to reach a favorable conclusion with respect to foreign influence \nand financial considerations concerns, I am unable to reach the same conclusion with \nrespect to personal conduct concerns. As I mentioned at the outset, I consider John and \nMary to be decent, honorable, hard working, responsible parents, and loyal U.S. \ncitizens. I cannot, however, overcome the concerns I have regarding the judgment they \nexercised and continue to exercise by their misplaced trust and confidence in their \nfriend, Pablo.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. John and \nMary have not completely mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude they are not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 2.a. - 2(b)(1) \u2013 (3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. 3 Applicant testified at his hearing, and I found his testimony to be credible. Applicant is a 50-year-old software engineer, who has been employed by his defense contractor employer since November 2005. GE1, Tr. 25-26. He has successfully held a security clearance at some level since 1981. In 1981, he was granted a secret security clearance shortly after enlisting in the U.S. Air Force, discussed infra. That clearance was later upgraded to a top secret security clearance in 1994, which he has continuously held since then. When he was transitioning from the Air Force, he applied for a job with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He was vetted for and granted a top secret clearance in 2001 by the CIA, but \u201cdecided not to take the job.\u201d He seeks to renew his top secret clearance, which is an employment requirement. GE 1, Tr. 25-28. Applicant was born in Columbia in March 1958. GE 1.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Standard Form (SF) 86 on October 27, 2005. On March \n18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guidelines B \n(Foreign Influence) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 2, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR on April 8, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 14, 2008, and I received the \ncase assignment on June 9, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 20, 2008, \nscheduling the case for July 17, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant \nobjected to GE 1 on the grounds of authenticity, and had no objection to GE 2 through \nGE 4. I admitted GE 1 over Applicant\u2019s objection, and also admitted GE 2 through GE 4. \nApplicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through AE E. Department Counsel \nobjected to all of Applicant\u2019s exhibits on the grounds of authenticity and hearsay. I \nadmitted AE A through E over Department Counsel\u2019s objections. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 25, 2008.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Request for Administrative Notice (Exhibit (Ex.) \nI(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts contained in \nEx. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through V. Without objection from Applicant I \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which \npertained to Columbia. Tr. 13-15.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \nGovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nColumbia were derived from Exs. I(A), and I through V as contained infra under the \nsubheading \u201cColumbia\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.d., and 1.f. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 2.a. - 2(b)(1) \u2013 (3). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant testified at his hearing, and I found his testimony to be credible. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old software engineer, who has been employed by his defense \ncontractor employer since November 2005. GE1, Tr. 25-26. He has successfully held a \nsecurity clearance at some level since 1981. In 1981, he was granted a secret security \nclearance shortly after enlisting in the U.S. Air Force, discussed infra. That clearance \nwas later upgraded to a top secret security clearance in 1994, which he has \ncontinuously held since then. When he was transitioning from the Air Force, he applied \nfor a job with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He was vetted for and granted a top \nsecret clearance in 2001 by the CIA, but \u201cdecided not to take the job.\u201d He seeks to \nrenew his top secret clearance, which is an employment requirement. GE 1, Tr. 25-28. \n \nApplicant was born in Columbia in March 1958. GE 1.

This is Applicant\u2019s younger brother, age 48, and he is a Columbian \ncitizen residing in Columbia. He is separated from his second wife, has three children, \nand lives in Columbia. He has been deported twice from the U.S. back to Columbia in \n1988 and 2000, both times for selling drugs. He is not allowed to return to the U.S. \nApplicant stays in contact with his younger brother \u201ctwo times a year\u201d by telephone or e-\nmail. It is Applicant\u2019s understanding is that his brother \u201chas a small business in which he \nsells gas station supplies.\u201d Tr. 44-46, 76-77. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \nMother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, age 58, is a Columbian citizen, and \nlives with Applicant and his wife. Applicant and his wife \u201csponsored\u201d his mother-in-law to \nmove to the U.S. in February 2004 to care for their three year old son. His mother-in-law \nis not married, and telephones her 74-year-old mother in Columbia \u201cprobably once a \nmonth,\u201d and sends her \u201c$100 maybe\u201d a month. Neither Applicant\u2019s wife nor any of her \nfamily members are employed, associated or affiliated with the Columbian government. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is \u201cseriously thinking\u201d about applying for U.S. citizenship when \neligible in February 2009. Tr. 38-43. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \nSince immigrating to the U.S. in 1973, Applicant has traveled to Columbia four \ntimes. He returned to Columbia to attend his mother\u2019s funeral in 1984, and again in \n1992, 2002, and 2007. Except for his 1984 visit, the remaining visits were primarily for \n\u201cpleasure\u201d and visiting family members. Tr. 49-51. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \n \nApplicant \u201csponsored\u201d two of his \u201csecond cousins\u201d from Columbia for student \nvisas in the U.S. in 2001 and 2006. The second cousin he sponsored in 2001 recently \ngraduated from college and lives in the U.S., discussed supra under Sister (age 55). \nThe other second cousin is 23 years old and studying English in the U.S. Tr. 53-54. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant stated if any of his family members in Columbia were approached by \nanyone seeking information about Applicant, he would contact his facility security \nofficer. Tr. 56. \n \nIn 1988, Applicant made a $15,000 cash deposit into an international bank \naccount located in the U.S, which resulted in Applicant being queried about the source \nof the deposited funds. The money belonged to two resident citizens of Columbia. \nSubsequent to that transaction, Applicant was interviewed or provided information on \nthree separate occasions on September 7, 2000, February 12, 2001, and November 15, \n2007. It was alleged that Applicant provided inconsistent explanations regarding this \ntransaction. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 2.a., 2.b.(1) \u2013 (3)).  \n \nThese purported inconsistencies are summarized in order. First, the SOR alleged \nApplicant stated his former sister-in-law asked him to make a $15,000 deposit into her \nhusband\u2019s account in a September 2000 signed, sworn statement. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.(1)). \nSecond, the SOR alleged Applicant stated he was asked by a friend to make a $15,000 \ndeposit into her brother-in-law\u2019s international bank account in a February 2001 \nmemorandum to the Defense Investigative Service (DIS). (SOR \u00b6 2.a.(2)).Third, the \nSOR alleged Applicant stated his girlfriend at the time asked him to take her mother to \nthe bank to make a deposit into a joint international bank account belonging to her \ndaughter and her son-in-law, adding the mother was unable to speak English clearly \nand Applicant made the deposit to help her (the mother) in a November 2007 signed, \nsworn statement. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.(3)). \n \nApplicant testified at his hearing and clarified these explanations. In his \ntestimony, Applicant stated at the time he made the deposit, he did not know the money \nbelonged to two Columbian citizens, and was being deposited on their behalf. It was not \nuntil 2001 that Applicant learned who the money belonged to. I note from observing \nApplicant that he struggled to recall events, which bolsters his explanation that over \ntime his acuity diminished. Pertinent parts of the exchange between Department \nCounsel and Applicant are quoted, which demonstrate this assertion as well as the \ndifficulty of reconstructing a fairly complex factual pattern years after it occurred.  \n \nQ. Okay. Now in your sworn statement dated September 7, 2000, which is \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibit 2, you state on page 5 on February 17 of 1988 my \nformer sister-in-law asked me to make a deposit of $15,000 into her \nhusband\u2019s account. Is that correct? \n \nA. That\u2019s what I wrote, yes. \n \nQ. Okay. And in your signed statement dated February 12, 2001, which is \nGovernment Exhibit 3, you have a memorandum in there on page 3 where \nyou state that you were asked  -- I was asked by my friend, [HB] to make a \n$15,000 deposit into her brother-in-law, [LL\u2019s] international bank account \nof [bank name]. Is that correct? \n \nA. Correct. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nQ. Okay. And then in November 15, 2007, you gave a signed sworn \nstatement and on page 2, the first full paragraph there, on February, 1988, \nI made a $15,000 cash deposit at the [bank name]. This was not my \nmoney, my girlfriend at the time, [PP] need(ed) to take her mother [DP] to \nthe bank to make a deposit. \n \nThe mother, [DP] wanted to make a bank deposit into a joint international \nbank account belonging to [DP\u2019s] daughter, [DEP] and her son-in-law, \n[LL]. Do you see that? \n \nA. Yes. The statement I made back then, I got confused. It was \u2013 I \nconfused her mom with her sister because of the name. Her sister has \nalso the same name that her mom does, [D]. \n \nSo when the officer told me that I had said in the past that I \u2013 the past is \nsomething for [D], then I immediately relate it to her mom, not to her sister. \n \nQ. Okay. So you\u2019re saying when you made this statement in 2007 you \nconfused her mother\u2019s name with her sister? \n \nA.  Correct. \n \nQ. Okay. And it\u2019s your testimony that you intended to say her sister? \n \nA. Correct. \n \nQ. Okay. But still you \u2013 between the Government\u2019s \u2013 between your first \nstatement in 2000, your second statement in 2001 you state \u2013 your first \nstatement you state that it was your former sister-in-law? \n \nA. Yes. And [H] is the person that \u2013 [H] is my friend and she was never my \nwife or anything officially, which is just someone that I knew that I would \nsay. So I say sister-in-law, you know, it\u2019s not -- speak of sister-in-law I said \nbecause [H] was my girlfriend.  \n \nSo, but in reality, officially or legally, she was never my sister-in-law \nbecause my relationship to [H] was not more than boyfriend and girlfriend. \n \nQ. So why did you say sister-in-law? \n \nA. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I really don\u2019t know. I should have said [H\u2019s] sister, \nbecause my relationship to [H] was not \u2013 never officially a legal \nrelationship. \n \nQ. But she was your girlfriend? \n \nA. She was my girlfriend, yes. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nQ. When you gave your second statement in 2001, you refer to \u2013 you \nstate that a friend asked you to make that deposit? \nA. Yes my friend [H] was my girlfriend. \n \nQ. You didn\u2019t say your girlfriend? \nA. Yes, I didn\u2019t say my girlfriend. \n \nQ. Okay. Now, you state that in your third statement that you made the \ndeposit because [H\u2019s] mother was unable to speak English clearly? \n \nA. Right. And that\u2019s \u2013 when I say this I mean [H\u2019s] sister, right. \n \nQ. So today, again, you\u2019re stating that this \u2013 that you meant to say her \nsister? \n \nA. Yes. The reason why, is because and I\u2019ll tell you this, they have the \nsame name. And I knew [H\u2019s] sister by niece and her second \u2013 the middle \nname of [H\u2019s] sister is [E] and they call her [N]. \n \nSo, when I was told by the officer of [D], I immediately related it to her \nmother instead of [H\u2019] sister. \n \nQ. Okay. But you told the \u2013 this is your statement, correct? \n \nA. Yes. \n \nQ. And so you told \u2013 you made the statement that it was her mother not \nher sister. \n \nA. Correct. But again, that\u2019s because of the confusion. This is after almost \na year after everything had happened and from the statement in 2001 to \n2007 is six years apart and I don\u2019t remember too well what happened that \nday.  \n \nQ. You don\u2019t remember if you took [H\u2019s] sister or [H\u2019s] mother? \n \nA. Well, now after investigating and when I talked to [H\u2019s] sister about two \nmonths ago, I\u2019m sure it was her, the one that \u2013 when we (met) at the bank.  \n \nQ. Okay. Now again, you didn\u2019t have any concern that you were \ndepositing that amount of money into a bank account that didn\u2019t belong to \nyou? \n \nA. I did not. \n \nQ. You didn\u2019t have any concern that \u2013 it was apparently [LL\u2019s] international \nbank account, correct? \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nA. Right. \n \nQ. You didn\u2019t have any concern that this amount of money was brought \nover [to] the United States in cash? \n \nA. I did not at the time. [H] was my friend and I trusted her and we had a \ngood relationship and I didn\u2019t think she would ever have me do something \nthat was inappropriate or illegal. \n \nQ. You didn\u2019t think that since it was an international bank account that [LL] \ncould deposit the money himself? \n \nA. [LL] was not in the United States at the time. \n \nQ. But it\u2019s an international bank account. \n \nA. Yes. \n \nQ. Okay. So he could have done it on his own? \n \nA. In Columbia for sure. Yes. \n \nQ. But he didn\u2019t do that? \n \nA. Probably not. \n \nQ. Have you done anything like this since 1998? \n \nA. No. And I know better now that my actions were not appropriate at the \ntime.  \n \nQ. Why \u2013 what do you mean by that? \n \nA. I mean that I will ask questions now if someone asked me to deposit \n$15,000 or any amount of money. I would ask questions, where\u2019s this \nmoney coming from, where\u2019s it going to, and if everything is legal then I \nwon\u2019t hesitate to do it. Tr. 60-65. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former girlfriend\u2019s mother (DP \u2013 same name as her mother) submitted \na signed, sworn statement, executed in the U.S., stating in part: \n \nIn and around February 1988, my fianc\u00e9 and I were trying to buy a house. I \nwanted to live close to my mother [DP] and my sister [HB] whom lived in the \nUnited States for many years, my mother and my sister are US citizens. \n \nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided to deposit into my fiance\u2019s [name of bank] account \n$15,000 dollars that we had gradually brought from Columbia over a \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nnumber of trips, to use as down payment towards the purchase of a house \nin the United States. I asked my sister to take me to the bank to make this \ndeposit. My sister, [HB], was unable to take me to the bank, so she asked \n[Applicant] to take me to the bank. While at the bank, I asked [Applicant] to \nfill-up the deposit slip for me since I did not understand English and did not \nknow what to write and where. [Applicant] gracefully filled up the deposit \nslip and I asked [Applicant] to make the deposit in case they asked me \nsomething in English that I would not understand. I handed [Applicant] the \n$15,000 dollars and he approached the teller counter and made the deposit \non my behalf. [Applicant] deposited  the $15,000 in my fiance\u2019s [name of \nbank] account. AE A. \n \n \nThe husband (LL) of Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend\u2019s mother submitted a signed, \nsworn statement executed in Columbia, stating in part: \n \nI am part owner of [name of business] since 1988 located in Columbia, \nwith [substantial sales]. My three sons were educated in the US and are \nUS citizens. \n \nDuring the trips my fianc\u00e9 [DP] and I made to Columbia, we gradually \nbrought money with the intention of buying a house, and in fact we did so \nin the year 2000. I went on a business trip to Columbia while my fianc\u00e9 \nstayed in the US with her mother [DD] and her sister [HB]. My fiance\u2019s \nmother and sister are both US citizens. My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to deposit \nthe money in my [name of bank]. My fianc\u00e9 asked [Applicant] to deposit \nthe money since she was unable to understand [E]nglish hence did not \nunderstand the teller[\u2019]s questions. This is how in fact the fifteen thousand \ndollars were deposited in my [name of bank] account. AE B. \n \nThe author (LL) of AE B also submitted a letter from his bank dated May 8, 2008, \nwhich stated his bank account was opened on February 12, 1998. AE C. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from the Columbian Government Trade Bureau in \nWashington, DC, that provided data about the business owned by the author (LL) of AE \nB. The letter reflects the business owned by LL is in good standing. Tr. 83-85, AE D.  \n \nIn response to my question inquiring how Applicant would resolve the \ndiscrepancies surrounding the $15,000 deposit in 1998, he stated: \n \nSir, I mean I know it\u2019s negligence on my part that I did this and I should \nhave asked questions. I know that my statements were not consistent and \nI really never thought that they were going to be taken literally like I had \nput it down. \n \nI think I have a good explanation on why I got confused. And I had never \ntried to hide anything that I\u2019ve done. I always come forward to say what \nhappened.

Applicant earns $108,000 annually as a software engineer, and earns an \nadditional $18,000 annually, teaching computer science courses part-time at a local \ncommunity college. Tr. 104-105. \n \nColumbia1 \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with a population of \napproximately 44.8 million. Colombia is the second most populous country in South \nAmerica. Any person born in Colombia is considered a Colombian citizen. \n \n \nThe Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to \nColombia. Violence by narco-terrorist groups continues to affect some rural areas and \ncities. The potential for violence by terrorists and other criminal elements exists in all \nparts of the country. Terrorists and other criminal organizations continue to kidnap and \nhold persons of all nationalities and occupations for use as bargaining chips. No one is \nimmune from kidnapping on the basis of occupation, nationality or other factors. U.S. \nGovernment officials and their families have strict limitations on travel to and within \nColombia due to these dangers.  Kidnap or murder victims in Colombia have included \njournalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers and business people, as well \nas tourists and even small children. Approximately 298 kidnappings committed by \nterrorist groups and for-profit kidnap gangs were reported to authorities in 2007.  \nRobbery and other violent crimes are common in major cities while small towns and \nrural areas can be extremely dangerous due to the presence of narco-terrorists. \n \n \nThe Secretary of State has designated three Colombian groups \u2013 the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), \nand the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) \u2013 as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations.  These groups have carried out bombings and other attacks in and \naround major urban areas, including against civilian targets. Terrorist groups have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure (e.g., water, oil, gas, and electricity), public recreational \nareas, and modes of transportation. The FARC has targeted civilians, government \nrepresentatives and politicians, soldiers, and the civilian infrastructure. Three Irish \nRepublican Army members assisted in training the FARC on IRA bomb tactics in \nColombia.  FARC held three U.S. government contractors -- all U.S. citizens -- hostage \nfor five years, until they were rescued on July 2, 2008 by the Colombian military. Some \nborder areas have become terrorist safe havens. \n \n \n1 The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs.

Unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, \ninsubordinate military collaboration with criminal groups, torture and mistreatment of \ndetainees, overcrowded and insecure prisons, and other serious human rights abuses \nwere reported during 2007. Illegal armed groups and terrorist groups committed the \nmajority of human rights violations\u2013including political killings and kidnappings, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n2 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n3 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his sister and to a lesser extent with his brother in Columbia. These close \nrelationships create a potential risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion meriting a close examination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these the three disqualifying \nconditions under AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b) and 7(d) as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nevidence presented. The Government established Applicant\u2019s sister and brother are \nresident citizens of Columbia, and that Applicant maintains frequent contact with them \nby telephone/e-mail and travel. His mother-in-law is a Columbian citizen and she lives \nwith the Applicant. She has frequent, non-casual contact with her family in Columbia. \nAlso, Applicant sponsored two of his second cousins from Columbia for U.S. student \nvisas. \n \nThe $15,000 cash deposit in 1998 into an international bank account of money \nbelonging to two Columbian citizens is also relevant and is a concern under Foreign \nInfluence. It is discussed further under Personal Conduct, infra. The burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence and prove mitigating condition(s). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to his immediate family. ISCR \nCase No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has demonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for/and or \nobligation to his sister and brother by telephone and e-mail contact as well as his travel \nto Columbia.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a career homemaker, wife, and mother of two children. Her \nhusband (Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law) has been employed as a career electrician for the \nColumbian government. There is nothing in the record to suggest his employment has \nbeen anything other than a non-political position. Applicant\u2019s niece was educated in the \nU.S., is working in the U.S., and plans to become a U.S. citizen when eligible. His \nnephew is currently unemployed (discussed supra under Facts, Sister). Applicant\u2019s \nyounger brother lives in Columbia and since being deported twice from the U.S. for drug \ninvolvement, is a small business owner living in Columbia selling gas station supplies. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is unmarried, lives with Applicant and his wife, and she \nprovides day care for Applicant\u2019s three-year-old son. She is part of the family, and is \nconsidering becoming a U.S. citizen. His mother-in-law\u2019s contact with Columbia is \nprimarily limited to monthly telephone calls and modest monetary gifts to her 74-year-\nold mother in Columbia. Apart from Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, who holds a non-political \nGovernment job with the Columbian government, none of Applicant\u2019s relatives living in \nColumbia or in the U.S. are associated with or affiliated with the Columbian government. \nThe record does not identify what influence, if any, the Columbian government could \nexert on Applicant\u2019s sister or brother as a result of their being resident citizens of \nColumbia. However, their presence in Columbia, and Applicant\u2019s foreign travel as well \nas his sponsoring relatives for U.S. visas creates concerns under this Guideline. As \nsuch, the burden shifted to Applicant to show his relatives in Columbia and travel there \ndo not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cColumbia,\u201d the U.S. Secretary of State has \ndesignated three Columbian groups, FARC, ELN, and AUC as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. Although the Columbian government\u2019s respect for human rights \ncontinues to improve, terrorist groups operating within Columbia have committed the \nmajority of human rights violations to include political killings and kidnapping, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this \nproceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [his relationship with his family member in Columbia] could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s continued and ongoing relationship with his \nColumbian relatives and nature of unlawful activities in Columbia by terrorist \norganizations places Applicant in just this position, given his close relationship with his \nfamily and their continued presence and connection with Columbia.  \n \nHowever, Applicant is able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s \nsister and brother maintain non-political low key positions in Columbia. Full application \nof AG \u00b6 8(a) is also precluded given the past criminal drug activity of Applicant\u2019s \nyounger brother in the U.S. Although the evidence does not suggest Applicant\u2019s \nyounger brother is engaged in any illegal activity at present in Columbia, his having \nbeen deported twice from the U.S. for selling drugs remains troubling and lingers as a \nserious concern. \n \nApplicant is able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(b). His relationship with his \nColumbian relatives is minimal when compared and contrasted with his immediate \nrelatives in the U.S. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., [h]e can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.\u201d His three sons and wife are U.S. born citizens and reside in the U.S., \nand they are fully inculcated with U.S. values. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1973 \nand served a 20-year career in the Air Force. He has worked for a defense contractor \nwith dedication and distinction since retiring from the Air Force. He has substantial \nproperty and investments in the U.S., and no property or investments in Columbia. He \nhas many friends and colleagues in the U.S. He is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. He \nprovided a work-related reference from his Assistant Program Manager to corroborate \nhis loyalty and trustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant is able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(f) because his $15,000 \ndeposit was on behalf of another party. He has no assets in Columbia as opposed to all \nof his assets being in the U.S. A thorough comparison of his relationship to the U.S. as \ncompared to his relationship with Columbia is further discussed under the Whole \nPerson Concept, infra. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the Government\u2019s concern under this Guideline: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately, i.e. knowingly and willfully. An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. \n \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s purported inconsistencies in his \nSeptember 2000 signed, sworn statement, his February 2001 memorandum, and \nNovember 2007 signed, sworn statement regarding the 1998 $15,000 cash deposit. AG \n\u00b6 17(f) provides a condition that could mitigate security concerns in this case, stating, \n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(f) fully applies. \n \nHaving had the opportunity to listen to his testimony and observe his demeanor, \nhis explanations as set forth in the findings of fact are accepted as credible. The \nexchange between Department Counsel and Applicant, supra, demonstrates how \nconfusion could arise surrounding this transaction considering the similarity of names, \ncultural complexities, and passage of time.  \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nI note that Applicant has held a top secret security clearance since 1994 and was \nvetted for a top secret security clearance by the CIA in 2001. This transaction \npresumably would have been uncovered and evaluated during renewal(s) of his top \nsecret clearance(s) for the Air Force and CIA. The evidence is not sufficient to show that \nhe made deliberately false statements when he provided his explanations surrounding \nthe $15,000 deposit on three separate occasions or that his conduct was otherwise \ninappropriate or unlawful. There is no evidence that the $15,000 deposit involved any \nillegal activity such as money laundering. As such there is no evidence of a motive to \nfabricate. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d4 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.   \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication.5 In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. Ultimately, the \nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3. \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Columbia. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

First, three foreign terrorist organizations have been identified by the \nU.S. Secretary of State that are operating within Columbia. Illegal armed terrorist groups \ncommitted human rights violations to include political killings and kidnappings, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Although Columbia \nand the U.S. enjoy a cordial relationship, the existence these terrorist groups and their \nconcomitant internal problems within Columbia remain a concern. Second, Applicant \nwas born in Columbia and spent a significant portion of his formative years in Columbia. \nThird, Applicant visited Columbia four times, i.e. in 1984, 1992, 2002, and 2007 since \nimmigrating to the U.S. in 1973. Fourth, he sponsored two of his Columbian second \ncousins for U.S. student visas in 2001 and 2006. Fifth, in 1998, he deposited $15,000 \ninto a bank account in the U.S. on behalf of two Columbian citizens. Sixth, his \nColumbian mother-in-law lives with him and his wife, and she maintains contact with her \nmother in Columbia. Seventh, he maintains frequent contacts with his sister and to a \nlesser extent his brother in Columbia, who was deported two times from the U.S. for \ndrug involvement. These contacts and visits are collective manifestations of strong \naffection and regard Applicant has for family members in Columbia and/or connections \nwith Columbia. \n \n \nThere is significant mitigating evidence that weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. Applicant immigrated to the U.S. when he was 15 years old, and \ncompleted his high school education in the U.S. Shortly after completing high school, he \nenlisted in the Air Force and successfully completed a 20-year career. Shortly after \nenlisting in 1981, he was granted a secret clearance, which was later upgraded to a top \nsecret clearance in 1994. He has held a top secret clearance since then. He was vetted \nfor and granted a top secret clearance by the CIA in 2001, the year he retired from the \nAir Force. All told, he has successfully held a security clearance at some level for 27 \nyears.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for the past 35 years, was married in the U.S., and \nhas three U.S. born children in the U.S. His assets in the U.S. are substantial in contrast \nto having no assets in Columbia. He became a U.S. citizen shortly after enlisting in the \nAir Force and holds a U.S. passport. His wife is a U.S. born citizen. Although his \nmother-in-law is a Columbian citizen, she legally resides in the U.S. with Applicant and \nhis wife and is considering becoming a U.S. citizen. Also of note is the fact that \nApplicant has two older brothers, who are U.S. citizens, who reside in the U.S. He also \nhas a niece (his sister\u2019s daughter), who resides in the U.S. and plans on becoming a \nU.S. citizen when eligible.  \n \nApplicant maintains much more frequent contact with his U.S. based siblings \nthan he does with his siblings residing in Columbia. His ties to the United States are \nstronger than his ties to his sister and brother in Columbia. There is no evidence \nApplicant has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United \nStates.6 He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has worked \n \n6 The Government does not have the burden of providing such evidence. \n \n\n \n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \ndiligently for his Government contractor/employer since November 2005. The evidence \ncontains no derogatory record evidence about the Applicant. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Columbia. Columbia and the \nU.S. enjoy a friendly relationship. Apart from the internal problems within Columbia, \nwhich are not endorsed by the Columbian government, Columbia is a multiparty \ndemocracy, whose government\u2019s respect for human rights continues to improve. There \nis no evidence in the record to support the notion that the Columbian government \nengages in an adversarial relationship with the U.S. \n \n \nIn the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in Columbia were subjected to \ncoercion or duress from a terrorist group within Columbia, I find that because of his \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that Applicant would \nresolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the \nUnited States. Noteworthy and given great weight is Applicant\u2019s 20 years of honorable \nservice to his country while serving in the Air Force, and his having successfully held a \nsecurity clearance for 27 years. Also the issue of the $15,000 deposit occurred in 1998 \nand is not recent. In any event, I found his explanation credible and found him to be \nsincere, cooperative, and forthright in questions posed throughout the hearing. Lastly, \nApplicant\u2019s Assistant Program Manager submitted a compelling endorsement on his \nbehalf. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that Applicant may have divided loyalties or act in a way \nadverse to U.S. interests or some attempt may be made to exploit Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in such a way that this U.S. citizen would have to choose between his \npledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign \ninfluence, and personal conduct.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n20 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                  Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.b. \n  \n \n     (1) \u2013 (3):  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant is a 35-year-old man who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria at the age of 17.\nSince his arrival in the U.S., he has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, obtained U.S.\ncitizenship, married, and had four children from two U.S. citizen spouses. Although he has family\nties or connections to Nigeria, his significant contacts and ties are to the U.S. Applicant has\nmitigated any potential foreign influence security concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nMarch 15, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline B for foreign influence based on\nApplicant\u2019s ties or connections to Nigeria. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn April 17, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 14, 2007, and the transcript was received on September 4, 2007. The\ntranscript reflects an incorrect case number.    \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges\nt\nh\na\nt\nApplicant may be subject to foreign\ninfluence due to his ties or connections to Nigeria. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f. In addition, the following facts are established.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old senior information specialist (a software developer) who was born\nin Nigeria in 1972. He arrived in the U.S. in 1989, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996.\nHe is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. \n\n3\nHe completed his secondary education in Nigeria in about May 1989. He then joined his\nparents in Cairo, Egypt, where they were living due to his father\u2019s military assignment with the\nNigerian Army. A few months later, his parents sent Applicant to the U.S. for a vacation as a reward\nfor doing well in school. He arrived in the U.S. in September 1989 and stayed with relatives. At the\ntime, the universities in Nigeria were closed for an indefinite period due to student protests against\nthe current government. At his relatives\u2019 suggestion, and with his parents\u2019 permission, Applicant\ndecided to pursue his college education in the U.S. \nAbout two years after his arrival, he registered with the U.S. Selective Service System\n(Exhibit J). He was awarded a bachelor of science in computer science in 1994 (Exhibit B). In doing\nso, he earned honors in basic studies and computer science. In addition, he minored in the subjects\nof business administration and mathematics. \nHe met and married his first wife while in college. She is a native-born U.S. citizen. They\nmarried in 1990, separated in 1992, and divorced in 1995. They have two children, a 15-year-old\ndaughter and a 14-year-old son. The children are native-born U.S. citizens and reside here. Both\nchildren live with their mother, although they visit Applicant during summer vacation. Applicant\npays child support for their benefit.\nApplicant married another native-born U.S. citizen in 1998. They divorced five years later.\nThey reunited in 2004 and married again in 2005. They have two children, a seven-year-old son and\na three-year-old son. The children are native-born U.S. citizens and reside here. Next year, Applicant\nand his wife are expecting a third child.  \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen in 1996, Applicant has made three trips to Nigeria. The first\ntrip in 1997 was to introduce his then fiancee to his family, and for her to understand his cultural\nheritage firsthand. The second trip in 2001 was to introduce the couple\u2019s first son to the family. The\nthird trip in 2006 was to introduce the couple\u2019s second son to the family. For each trip, he traveled\non a U.S. passport; his last Nigerian passport expired some years ago (Exhibits K, L and M). And\nfor each trip, he registered at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Nigeria. \n Applicant was raised in a large family. Ethnically, his family belongs to the predominately\nCatholic Igbo people, which is the largest ethnic group in the southeast of Nigeria (See Exhibit 5,\nSource Document I at 2). His parents, two brothers, and three sisters are citizens of and residents in\nNigeria. Another two brothers are Nigerian citizens, but they live and work in the U.S. His parents\nare both well educated as are his several siblings.  \nApplicant\u2019s father served in the Nigerian Army for about 35 years before retiring in 1993\n(Exhibit O). He retired at the rank of colonel and receives a pension, which he does not depend on\nas a sole source of income. His primary source of income is stock dividends and rent from real\nestate. \nApplicant\u2019s mother taught in colleges operated by the Nigerian government before working\nat the headquarters of the Nigerian Ministry of Education (Exhibit P). She retired from the education\nministry and receives a pension, which she does not depend on as a sole source of income. Her\nprimary source of income comes from farming. She owns large hectares of palm plantations and\ncassava farms. Like her husband, another source of income is stock dividends. \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is a 33-year-old senior banking officer working in the marketing and\nsales department for a bank in Nigeria (Exhibit Q). She is widowed and the mother of two sons, ages\nten and seven. Her two sons live with her parents in order for her to focus on her job. To help his\nsister with her job, Applicant purchased about $500 of shares of the bank  (Exhibits 4, V, and W).\nThe shares were purchased for him, his wife, and his two sons. Collectively, they own about 11,298\nunits or shares. The approximate market value of all shares is less than $1,500 (See R. 95\u201396,\n173\u2013175). \nHis second sister is a 23-year-old school teacher in Nigeria (Exhibit T). She was born in the\nUnited Kingdom and holds dual citizenship with that country and Nigeria. She has a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in French, and she is presently working as a French teacher. \nApplicant\u2019s adopted  sister is also 23 years old and she lives with her parents (Exhibit U).\nShe is preparing to sit for the entrance examination to gain admission to a university to study\nnursing. Applicant has not had much contact with her given their differences in age. \nIn addition to his three sisters, he has four brothers, two of whom live and work in Nigeria.\nHis 30-year-old brother is an architect (Exhibit R). He is married and self-employed. He is currently\nrunning a start-up business that is involved in post-construction cleaning of residential and\ncommercial property. Applicant\u2019s 25-year-old brother is a university graduate in the field of urban\nand regional planning (Exhibit S). He is not employed at the moment, but is doing some freelance\nphotography and publishing.\nApplicant\u2019s two brothers in the U.S. were both born in Nigeria and are Nigerian citizens.\nThey are also lawful residents of the U.S. His older brother is a medical doctor who lives with his\nwife (also an M.D.) and a daughter in the U.S. His younger brother works as a systems\nadministrator. He is married and has children as well. Both brothers married native-born U.S.\ncitizens. And both brothers intend to become U.S. citizens when they are able to do so.\nFrom time to time, Applicant has provided money to his parents. Since 1989, Applicant\nestimates that he has given his parents or siblings in Nigeria about $3,000 (R. 96\u201398).  In the past,\nhe has sent the money via Western Union and paid high fees to do so. To avoid the high fees,\nApplicant established an account with a bank in Nigeria. This allows him to transfer money from\nthe U.S. bank account to the Nigerian bank account without a fee. Due to his financial\nresponsibilities  and litigation with a former business partner, Applicant has been unable to send any\nmore money to his parents or siblings. As of August 2007, the account balance was $100 (Exhibit\nX).   \nApplicant has worked in his field since earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1994. He has worked\nfor the same company, in different positions, since 1996. He is currently working as a senior\ninformation specialist in the modeling, simulation, and collaborative solutions group. He has a\nfavorable work history as reflected by performance evaluations and character references (Exhibits\nD, E, F, Y, Z, AA, and BB). In general, his character references have high regard for Applicant\u2019s\ntechnical abilities, work performance, professionalism, and integrity. In 2001, he was awarded a\nUnited States Patent, on behalf of his employer, for a secure data storage system and method\n(Exhibit C). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n5\nApplicant is active in his local community. He is an active member of his church, and he is\na  member and officer of a local chapter of a religious fraternal benefits organization (Exhibits G and\nH). In addition, Applicant is involved in youth soccer as a parent and coach (Exhibits I and CC). \nAdministrative notice is taken of the facts about Nigeria as described in the government\u2019s\nrequest (Exhibit 5). Five of the six source documents for the request are reports by the U.S.\nDepartment of State, and the sixth is from the Congressional Research Service. The following facts\nabout Nigeria are highlighted:\n\u2022\nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa. Since gaining independence from the British\nin 1960, Nigeria has experienced periods of political instability. In 1999, Nigeria returned\nto civilian rule after years of military rule.\n\u2022\nThe Nigerian government\u2019s record on human rights is poor.\n\u2022\nViolent crime, committed by ordinary criminals as well as by persons in police and military\nuniforms, can occur throughout the country. Kidnaping for ransom of persons associated\nwith the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens, remains common in the Niger Delta\nregion.\n\u2022\nA travel warning issued in January 2007 warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to\nNigeria and of further deterioration of the security situation in the Niger Delta region. The\ntravel warning also notes that al Qaida leadership has expressed an interest in overthrowing\nthe Nigeria government. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members work for or are associated with the petroleum industry\nin the Niger Delta region. Likewise, none of his family members are native to the Niger Delta\nregion, and they do not live there. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 5\u20136 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n6\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about\n6\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  a security concern may arise due to foreign\n14\ncontacts and interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\n\n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n16\n See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n17\n DC 5 is \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\n18\nor foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 6. \n19\n7\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  The most\n15\npertinent condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case is the\nfirst disqualifying condition:\n[C]ontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.  \n16\nOf course, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not\u2014as a\nmatter of law\u2014disqualifying under Guideline B. But if only one relative lives in a foreign country\nand an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.17\nHere, Applicant comes from a large and close family, most of whom live in Nigeria. He has\nregular contacts and close relationships with his parents and nearly all his siblings. These\ncircumstances create the potential for a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a concern\nabout his understandable desire to help his parents and siblings in Nigeria.\nThe other DCs under Guideline B have been considered and none apply. In particular, the\nfifth DC  concerning foreign-financial interests was considered in light of Applicant\u2019s Nigerian\n18\nstock holdings and bank account, but it does not apply. His stock holdings are minor (less than\n$1,500) and the bank account was set up as a convenience. Combined, they do not amount to\n\u201csubstantial\u201d foreign-financial interests. These circumstances are relevant, however, because they\nindicate the strength of his family ties.  \nThree of the six mitigating conditions  under the guideline may apply to the facts and\n19\ncircumstances of this case:\nMC 1.  [T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.;\nMC 2.  [T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\n\n Revised Guidelines at 5.\n20\n8\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest; and\nMC 3.  [C]ontact or communications with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nThe first and third MC do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships with his parents and siblings\nare of sufficient magnitude or strength to negate these two MCs. He has regular contact with his\nparents and has traveled to Nigeria for family visits. There is at least a remote or slight possibility\nthat unsavory elements in Nigeria could attempt to use his family members to coerce or pressure\nApplicant.\nBut Applicant did establish that the second MC applies in his favor. The record evidence\nsupports a conclusion that Applicant has a depth of loyalty to the U.S., so that he can be expected\nto resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. The same can be said for his longstanding\nrelationships in the U.S. He has lived in the U.S. since 1989\u2014arriving here when he was 17 years\nold\u2014more than half of his life and all of his adult life. He obtained his college education in the U.S.,\nmarried U.S. citizens, and has four native-born U.S. citizen children. He has been a U.S. citizen\nsince 1996. His professional career is in the U.S., as are his financial and other interests. The\nNigerian stock and bank account are of minor value. His contacts and travel to Nigeria are not\nmotivated by political or financial interests, but by his sense of family. \nAlthough the second MC is the only applicable mitigating condition, the analysis does not\nnecessarily end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security concern under the whole-\nperson concept. First, in the post-9/11 world, the risk of terrorism and foreign influence can never\nbe ruled out, but the likelihood in Applicant\u2019s case is remote. That conclusion is supported by the\nfact that his family does not live in the Niger Delta region, which is the area of Nigeria of most\nconcern according to the State Department\u2019s travel warning. Second, Applicant can fairly be\ndescribed as a model immigrant. He compiled with U.S. law by registering with the Selective\nService in 1991, he earned a college degree in 1994, and he obtained U.S. citizenship in 1996. His\nspouse, children, professional career, and financial interests are in the U.S., and that situation is\nunlikely to change. And he is active in his community and church. He appears to be a well-\nestablished, law-abiding citizen whose interests are closely aligned with the U.S. These are examples\nof ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy such as the U.S. Third, this is not a case\nof \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d  with an applicant who has one foot in the U.S. and one foot in his native\n20\ncountry. On the contrary, the evidence shows Applicant has both feet firmly planted in the U.S. and\nthat his significant contacts and ties are to the U.S. Given all these circumstances, the record\nevidence supports a conclusion that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential foreign\ninfluence or pressure by either coercive or non-coercive means in favor of the U.S. interest. \nTo conclude, after weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has explained,\nextenuated, or mitigated the foreign influence security concern. And Applicant has overcome the\n\n9\ncase against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline B:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines E, J and D had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because he voluntarily\nadmitted to the issues raised in the SOR and those issues would not have become known if not for\nhis disclosures.  In support of his contention, Applicant essentially reargues the facts in his case and\nstates that his mistakes are in the past and he has demonstrated a new sense of trustworthiness.\nAlternatively, Applicant asks that the Board grant him a probationary clearance, subject to random\ndrug testing and counseling.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nAn applicant is not entitled to a delayed or deferred adjudication of his or her security\neligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-07018 at 10 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005).  Likewise, the Board\ndoes not have authority to grant a clearance on a conditional or probationary basis.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,\n2005).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nA review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered\nby Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge\nreasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s\nultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines E, J and D is sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as a Senior Mechanical Engineer, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe furnished untruthful information to the Government and engaged in conduct that exhibited poor\njudgement and untrustworthiness.  \n1.a. Applicant completed a signed, sworn SCA on April 3, 1997.  Question #24 a. of the SCA\nasked if, since Applicant was 16 or in the previous seven years, Applicant had illegally used any\ncontrolled substance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question. He should have listed the marijuana\n\n3\nand cocaine, discussed  below as 1.b.(1) and 1.b.(6), since he used those substances within the last\nseven years before he completed the SCA.\n1.b. Applicant admitted in his reply to the SOR, and during his testimony at the hearing that\nhe used the following illegal substances during the periods listed.\n(1) marijuana from 1974 to 2002\n(2) hashish in the middle 1970s\n(3) psilocybin mushrooms in the middle 1970s\n(4) mescaline in the middle 1970s\n(5) LSD in the middle 1970s\n(6) cocaine between 1976 and the early 1990s\n(7) methamphetamine between 1977 and the late 1980s\n1.c. Applicant completed a second SCA which he electronically submitted on April 5, 2002.\nQuestion #27 of the SCA asked if, since Applicant was 16 or in the previous seven years, Applicant\nhad used illegal drugs, including marijuana, etc. Applicant answered \"No.\" Applicant did not include\nhis use of marijuana  as listed in 1.b.(1) of the SOR, and discussed above.  \n1.d. On the April 5, 2002 SCA,  Question #28 asked if Applicant had ever used illegal drugs\nwhile possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered \"No.\" He did not list that he had used\nmarijuana while he held a security clearance that had been granted to him on August 19, 1997, by\nthe Department of Defense, as will be discussed further in allegation 1.g., below.\n1.e. Applicant completed a third SCA which he executed on October 8, 2003. Question #27\nof the SCA asked if, since Applicant was 16 or in the previous seven years, Applicant had used\nillegal drugs, including marijuana, etc. Applicant answered \"No.\" Applicant again did not list his use\nof marijuana  as listed in 1.b.(1) of the SOR, and discussed above.  \n1.f. On the October 8, 2003 SCA,  Question #28 asked if Applicant had ever used illegal\ndrugs while possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered \"No.\" He did not list that he had\nused marijuana while he held a security clearance that had been granted to him on August 19, 1997,\nas will be discussed in allegation 1.g., below.\n1.g. Applicant continued to use marijuana until 2002, while he held  security clearances that\nhad been granted to him, by the Department of Defense on August 19, 1997, and by the United States\nAir Force on August 21, 1997.\n1.h. Applicant used the services of a prostitute in 2003 in Japan, while he was married and\nwhile holding a security clearance.\n1.i. Applicant had sexual relations with a prostitute, who was a Philippine citizen,  in 2004\n\n4\nin Japan, while he was married and while holding a security clearance.\n1.j. Applicant traveled to the Philippines in June 2004 and December 2005, to meet and\ncontinue the sexual relationship that he had with the Philippine citizen, discussed in 1.i., above.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has engaged in criminal conduct. \n2.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, subparagraphs a., b., c., d., e., and\nf., constitutes a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which is a\nfelony.\n2.b. Applicant was arrested on May 5, 1992 and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol (DUI). He plead no contest to Reckless Driving and the imposition of sentence was\nsuspended for three years. He was assessed $1,300 in fines and penalties. No evidence was\nintroduced to suggest that Applicant has been involved in any more than one DUI in the last 15\nyears. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has engaged in sexual behavior that is either criminal, indicates a personality or emotional\ndisorder, reflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may subject an individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion.  \n3.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, subparagraphs h., i., j., constitutes\nthe kind of sexual behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it is criminal conduct, and it\nexhibits a lack of discretion and good judgement.   \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\n\n5\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug usage or criminal conduct, and that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\n\n6\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the\nGovernment incomplete, untruthful answers on three different SCAs that he executed on April 3,\n1997, April 5, 2002, and October 8, 2003. \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to\nour nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish\nrelevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he\nnevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In\nthis case, I conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers\nregarding his drug usage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC)  under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16.\n(a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and falsification of relevant\nfacts from personnel security questionnaires, which were used to determine security clearance\neligibility.  I can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, including his drug usage, especially while\nholding a security clearance, and the misinformation that he provided to the Government on three\noccasions, exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph\n1, Guideline E, against Applicant.\n(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct, by his knowingly providing false and misleading information the Government on three\nsecurity questionnaires, which is a felony. While it was not alleged as criminal conduct, his usage\nof illegal substances and the use of prostitutes also constitutes illegal conduct. \nDC 31. (a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. DC 31. (c),\nallegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, is also applicable to this case. There is no MC under Criminal Conduct. Paragraph 2,\nGuideline J is found against Applicant. \n(Guideline D -Sexual Behavior) \nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in the kind\nof sexual behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it is criminal conduct, and it exhibits a\nlack of discretion and good judgement.  \n\n7\nDC 13. (a), sexual behavior that is of criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted, applies to the facts of this case.  No MC can be found to apply here.  Paragraph 3,\nGuideline D is found against Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on February 17, 2005. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence), E (Personal Conduct), and J \n(Criminal Conduct).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on May \n13, 2008, and was transferred to me on June 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on June 20, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on July 23, 2008. \nThe government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted without \nobjection (Tr. 14-15). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and offered exhibits AE A \nthrough Y, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 16-17). DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 1, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.d., and 2.d. He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \u2013 2.c., and 3.a. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of all record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior engineer scientist, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since June 2002. He was born and raised in India. \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1989 at age 22. Tr. 129-130. He received two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree in the U.S.  \n \nIn 1996, Applicant married his Indian-born spouse in the U.S. He had traveled to \nIndia to meet her, and brought her to the U.S. on a fianc\u00e9 visa. (GE 1, Tr. 64-65). They \nhave two young children, ages eight and six. (GE 1). In 1995 and 2004, Applicant and \nhis wife, respectively, became naturalized U.S. citizens. Both of their children are U.S. \nborn citizens.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two of his siblings, a brother and a sister, are residents \nand citizens of India. His other three siblings, a brother and two sisters, are residents \nand naturalized citizens of the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). Applicant stated he is not close to his \nparents, but is \u201crespectful\u201d of them and telephones them \u201conce a month, at least.\u201d (Tr. \n136-138). His brother inherited the family business. Applicant stated he is not close to \nhis brother, but does speak to him usually on birthdays and in total \u201ctwice\u201d a year. (Tr. \n139-140.) His sister in India is a homemaker and her husband owns an automobile retail \nshop. Applicant stated he is not close to his sister because of their age difference. (Tr. \n49-50.) Applicant speaks to her on the telephone about the same number of times as he \nspeaks to his brother, which generally occurs on birthdays. (Tr. 49, 139-140). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are residents and \ncitizens of India. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). His mother-in-law is a homemaker, and his father-in-law \nowns \u201ca couple of chemical manufacturing factories.\u201d (Tr. 50-51). Applicant\u2019s wife \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntelephones her parents every \u201cfour to six weeks.\u201d (Tr. 51). Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law \nworks for a foreign owned company and \u201cthey make electrical things and [they] do a \nnumber of different things.\u201d (Tr. 52). Applicant has a sister-in-law (not alleged), who is a \nhomemaker, and her husband is a tax lawyer. Applicant speaks with his sister-in-law by \ntelephone \u201conce every six months.\u201d (Tr. 53-54.) Applicant stated he has not spent much \ntime with his in-laws and therefore does not consider himself to be close with them. \nApplicant stated his wife is not close with her siblings because of their age difference, \nand described her relationship with them as \u201crespectful.\u201d (Tr. 53.) Applicant\u2019s wife does \nnot provide her relatives in India with any financial support. (Tr. 54.) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has an aunt and a niece, who are residents and \ncitizens of India. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). During his testimony, Applicant clarified his relationship \nwith his \u201caunt,\u201d who is actually a distant cousin of his mother. His aunt came to the U.S. \nand took care of his children from 2001 to 2004. She has telephoned Applicant\u2019s \nchildren on their birthdays. (Tr. 54-55). Applicant\u2019s niece is his brother\u2019s daughter. \nApplicant\u2019s niece stayed with him from 2001 to 2003 while she was working on her \nmaster\u2019s degree. Applicant stated he has not communicated with his niece for \u201cabout \ntwo years.\u201d He last saw her when he attended his nephew\u2019s wedding in India in 2005. \n(Tr. 56-58). \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother living in the U.S. is a physician, married and has two adult \nsons. One of Applicant\u2019s sisters living in the U.S. is a widow, and has two adult sons. \nHis other sister is married, and has two children. Applicant did not know what his \nbrother-in-law does because he has not spoken to his sister and brother-in-law in four \nyears. (Tr. 59-61). \n \nSince his arrival to the United States in 1989, Applicant has travelled frequently \nback to India, initially to meet a bride, and later to visit his family and to participate in \nfamily events. He travelled to India in 1995, twice in 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2005. (Tr. \n63-67). \n \nApplicant never discusses his work with any of his relatives, including his \nparents, siblings, and in-laws. Applicant is a loyal American. He promised to report to \nhis employer any inquiries about his work and/or any possible threat against the United \nStates from any foreigners, U.S. citizens, or from his family members (Tr. 61-63, 67).  \n \nDuring a February 2004 government sponsored interview, when Applicant was \nasked to provide information about foreign nationals who may have lived at his \nresidence, he responded that no foreign nationals resided with him other than his niece, \nan Indian citizen enrolled in college. He failed to disclose that his wife\u2019s aunt had \nresided with him for about three months in 2001 and that this aunt had resided with him \nsince about 2001, and was living with him at the time of the interview. (SOR 1.a.) \n \nDuring the same interview, when Applicant was asked whether he paid any of the \nforeign nationals residing with him a salary for child care and/or for performing \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhousehold duties, he denied having done so. He failed to disclose that he had paid his \naunt currently residing with him a salary since late 2001. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). \n \nDuring March 2004 and April 2004 government-sponsored interviews, when he \nwas asked whether any foreign nationals living with him had been paid a salary for child \ncare and/or for performing household duties, he denied paying anyone a salary. He \nfailed to disclose that he had paid his aunt beginning in late 2001 a monthly salary of \n$250, which he later increased to $350 per month, and beginning in May 2002 \nincreased to $650 per month. At the time the interviews were conducted, Applicant was \npaying his aunt $650 per month and she was in the U.S. on a tourist visa. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant was denied program access by another U.S. government \nagency as a result of his having provided false statements, discussed supra. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d.).The denial letter provided a very detailed account of the facts summarized above. \n(GE 5). Applicant contested the allegations in his testimony, which I found \nunpersuasive. (Tr. 68-89). \n \nApplicant submitted five signed, sworn declarations from work-related \nreferences. All of the references held Applicant in high regard, considered him to be \ntrustworthy, and a valued employee. They all recommended Applicant for a security \nclearance. (AE A \u2013 E). Applicant owns a home and two rental properties. All of his bank \naccounts and 401k retirement accounts are in the U.S. He estimates his net worth to be \n\u201cat least a million and half or more.\u201d (Tr. 135.) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is a democratic republic \nwith a cooperative relationship with the United States. The United States recognizes \nIndia as a key to strategic U.S. interests, and has sought to strengthen its relationship \nwith India. The United States and India have been committed to a strategic partnership \nthat has seen expanded cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities, civilian \nspace programs, and technology trade. The United States is India's largest trading \npartner and investment partner. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, differences remain between the two countries, including \nconcerns about India\u2019s nuclear weapons program, abuses of human rights (although, \nthe Indian government is considered to generally respect the human rights of its \ncitizens), and its refusal to sign weapons non-proliferation treaties. Of grave concern is \nIndia\u2019s increasing cooperation and partnership with Iran and its military forces. Despite \nadvancements in the United States-Indian relations, India has been identified by the \nU.S. intelligence community as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. \neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information. The United States has sanctioned \nIndian scientists and chemical companies for transferring to Iran weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD)-related equipment and/or technology. Additionally, there are \nnumerous documented cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 6, Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.4 Applicant has frequent contacts and a \nrelationship, if not out of affection, certainly out of obligation with his parents, siblings, \nand his in-laws. His parents and two of his siblings are citizens and residents of India. \nThe closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone contacts \n \n4  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwith parents and to lesser extent with his siblings, and his frequent trips to India to visit \nhis family.  \n \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Indian agents may exploit the opportunity to \nobtain information about the United States. His connection to his in-laws also creates a \npotential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about his desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation.  \n \nThese relationships create a higher risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because of India\u2019s cooperation and partnership relationship with Iran, a \ncountry with interests inimical to the United States. His connections to his Indian family \nalso create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern about his desire to help his family by providing sensitive \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s frequent travel to India also creates a higher risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Indian government.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AGs \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Appellant did not establish \u201cit is \nunlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his \nIndian family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with his Indian family members could potentially force him to choose \nbetween the United States and India. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \n\u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with his Indian family members] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nApplicant has traveled to India six times since he immigrated to the United States \nin 1989. He did not rule out future travel to India. He and his wife became U.S. \nnaturalized citizens in 1995 and 2004, respectively. Applicant has contacts with and \nmaintains a \u201crespectful\u201d relationship with his parents and siblings and in-laws in India.  \n \nThe nature of India\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. I considered that \nthe Indian government is a democratic republic with a cooperative relationship with the \nUnited States. India generally respects the human rights of its citizens. India is not a \nhostile country nor are its interests inimical to the United States. The United States and \nIndia enjoy good relations and the United States is India's largest trading partner.  \n \nNotwithstanding, India\u2019s aggressive collection of proprietary and economic \ninformation, its industrial espionage against the United States and its partnership with \nIran places the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate \nfamily members in India do not pose a security risk and that he will not be placed into a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his Indian \nfamily members.5 India\u2019s partnership with Iran raises further concerns. Iran has an \nadversarial stance with the United States, a negative human rights record, and it is likely \nthat Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive \ninformation from the United States. \n                                                     \n5 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship \nand loyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United States for \napproximately 19 years. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 13 years. His young \nchildren have inculcated U.S. values. Applicant and his wife have established \nthemselves as successful American citizens. He has worked hard for numerous \nemployers in the United States, and continues his track record of diligent labor.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s information suggests his financial and business interests in the United \nStates are valued at around $1.5 million in contrast to having no assets in India. AG \u00b6 \n8(f) partially applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 18, the government\u2019s concern is as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAs noted, I found Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to provide truthful responses \nto government investigators not credible. Considering the record as a whole, I am \nconvinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the information about his aunt living \nat his residence and providing child care as well as performing household duties. \nNumerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: \nApplicant=s age, his level of education, his employment history, his motive to cover up \nhis conduct, thoroughness of the other government agencies denial letter, and overall \nlack of credibility as it pertained to Guideline E concerns. The truth is constant and had \nApplicant provided accurate and complete answers in 2004, he would not be in a \nposition of trying to explain them today. He knew or should have known of the \nimportance of providing accurate answers to the investigator, and nevertheless failed to \nprovide information that was material to making an informed security decision.  \n \nOf the Personal Conduct Disqualification Conditions, two are applicable AG \u00b6 \n16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire . . .\u201d, and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress . . .  .\u201d \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n\u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and conclude that \nnone apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and her favorable information is not \nsufficient to apply any of the MCs.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 30, the government\u2019s concern is as follows: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                     \nThe government established its case under Guideline J by showing that \nApplicant provided false statements to investigators in 2004. I find, as discussed above \nunder Guideline E, that Applicant deliberately provided false information to government \ninvestigators in 2004. His falsification of answers to government investigators is \nmaterial, serves to undermine the security clearance adjudication process, and is a \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, a felony.6 \n \n\u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \ne) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year. \n \nOf the Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed supra, two are applicable: \n\u00b6 31(a): \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent falsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct \nconcerns raised by his past behavior. I am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall \nquestionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR to determine factors such as the extent to which her behavior is recent; the \n \n6 It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Egan, 484 U.S. at \n527 (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.) \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                     \nlikelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the circumstances of the \nincidents alleged; and her rehabilitation.7 \n \n \n\u00b6 32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and \n \n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be \nmitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries \nof the Military Departments or designee; or the Directors of Washington \nHeadquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), \nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver. \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nrecent and not isolated. Considering his criminal behavior, the nature and seriousness \nof his misconduct, his falsifications, I find his favorable information insufficient to \nmitigate Guideline J security concerns. His behavior raises questions about his ability \nand willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. His \nrecent falsifications and lack of candor weigh against a finding or rehabilitation and \npositive behavioral changes. I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant strongly averred he and his family are loyal Americans, that they have \nwoven themselves into the fabric or America through their long-term participation in the \ncommunity, and their jobs. Applicant has lived in the United States for 19 years and has \nbeen a naturalized citizen for 13 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore \nallegiance to the United States. His two children are also U.S. citizens. They were born \nin the U.S., and Applicant plans to raise and educate them in the U.S.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible. There is \nno reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to \nhis sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States. There is no evidence he has ever taken \nany action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He has the respect \nand trust of his colleagues at work. India is a democracy and ally with the U.S. against \nterrorism. \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nIndia\u2019s relationship with Iran, India\u2019s aggressively seeking sensitive or protected U.S. \ninformation, that Applicant was born and raised in India, where in spent his formative \nyears. Applicant has frequent and non-casual contact with his family members living in \nIndia. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Indian agents or others hostile to U.S. \ninterests may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in India to obtain \ninformation about the United States. \n \nFor reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines E and J, incorporated \nherein, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable judgment, lack of reliability, \nand untrustworthiness.  \n \n \u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \n\n \n14 \n \n \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the concerns arising from foreign influence \nsecurity concerns, but failed to mitigate the concerns arising from personal conduct and \ncriminal conduct concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted all SOR allegations relating to delinquent debts and criminal conduct with explanation for some. He denied falsifying his answers on his application for security clearance (SF86). After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who has worked as a product technician on aircraft for the past five years. The first two years he worked for a different company in the southwest and moved to the east coast three years ago to work for higher wages for his present employer. Applicant was arrested and charged with theft in 1991 and received a deferred judgment. He was arrested and convicted for possession of cocaine in 1994 and given deferred probation for ten years and fined $4,000. Charges were later made for missing probation reporting in 1999 and 2004 resulting in three separate charges arising from the first arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a., c., and d.). The charges resulted from actions of a tenant in a group house on which Applicant held the lease. His tenant was storing and selling drugs out of the house with Applicant\u2019s knowledge. He was also arrested and charged in 2003 for possession of marijuana and unlawfully carrying a weapon arising from a speeding arrest. The marijuana was in his car in the possession of his wife who had used marijuana over several years. The gun was in the possession of a friend of his wife who was in the car with him unbekno",
    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Criminal Conduct; Financial; Personal Conduct\nDIGEST: Applicant failed to mitigate criminal conduct security allegations relating to arrests and\nconvictions on drug matters aggravated by probation violations and an outstanding warrant for his\narrest.

He also failed to mitigate financial allegations since only a few of his smaller debts and one\nof three delinquent tax debts have been resolved leaving approximately $22,000 in outstanding\ndelinquent debts. He mitigated personal conduct allegations relating to failure to detail his criminal\nrecord as lacking the requisite deliberate intent to omit since he did answer affirmatively that he did\nhave a criminal record. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn January 16, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on February 13, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 2,\n2007, for a hearing on March 23, 2007, but postponed at Applicant\u2019s request. A notice was re-issued\non April 11, 2007 for a hearing on April 24, 2007, and held that day. The government and Applicant\neach offered eight exhibits into evidence and all were admitted. The record was left open for\nadditional evidence and 18 additional exhibits were submitted by Applicant. They were admitted\nwithout objection. The transcript was received on May 4, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES \nThe government moved at the conclusion of the hearing to add an additional allegation to\nconform with evidence developed at the hearing as SOR \u00b6 3.c. under Personal Conduct to allege as\nfollows: \n\u201cYou falsified material facts on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions signed by\nyou  on September 27, 2005, in response to Question 23 (f) Your Police Record: In the last\nseven years have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed\nin response to a, b, c, d, or e above. You answered \u201cYes\u201d; However, you deliberately failed\nto disclose you had been arrested for two probation violations, first, on October 26, 1999, and\nsecond, on January 9, 2004\u201d.  \nApplicant had no comment on the motion to amend the SOR to add the additional allegation\nand the motion to amend was granted. \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations relating to delinquent debts and criminal conduct\nwith explanation for some. He denied falsifying his answers on his application for security clearance\n(SF86). After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who has worked as a\nproduct technician on aircraft for the past five years. The first two years he worked for a different\ncompany in the southwest and moved to the east coast three years ago to work for higher wages for\nhis present employer.\nApplicant was arrested and charged with theft in 1991 and received a deferred judgment. He\nwas arrested and convicted for possession of cocaine in 1994 and given deferred probation for ten\nyears and fined $4,000. Charges were later made for missing probation reporting in 1999 and 2004\nresulting in three separate charges arising from the first arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a., c., and d.). The charges\nresulted from actions of a tenant in a group house on which Applicant held the lease. His tenant was\nstoring and selling drugs out of the house with Applicant\u2019s knowledge. \nHe was also arrested and charged in 2003 for possession of marijuana and unlawfully\ncarrying a weapon arising from a speeding arrest. The marijuana was in his car in the possession of\nhis wife who had used marijuana over several years. The gun was in the possession of a friend of his\nwife who was in the car with him unbeknownst to Applicant. He was convicted only for the\nmarijuana possession. He has been on probation as a result of his conviction and a motion to revoke\nprobation was issued in 2005 and an active warrant was issued for his arrest. He is in the process of\nretaining counsel to satisfy the court and have the warrant dismissed but no action has been taken\nto do so. \nApplicant denied his two drug arrests at Question 23 (d) calling for such information on his\nSF86 submitted on September 27, 2005. He also omitted details of two arrests alleged in SOR 1. a.\nand c. for the probation violations arising from the 1994 offense at Question 23 (f) although he\nanswered affirmatively that there had been arrests other than those described in Question 23 (a- e).\nHe also omitted information about the probation arrests in his interview with a Department of\nDefense investigator on May 15, 2006, although he did discuss both the 1994 and 2003 drug arrests\nin that interview. \nApplicant was alleged to have delinquent debts totaling over $25,000 of which approximately\nhalf, or approximately $12,000, are for back federal taxes for three years and another $10,000 for\ntwo auto repossessions. The remaining consist of eight debts, only one of which is in excess of\n$1,000, that are for routine charges and living expenses he could not pay. He has made payments on\nsome of them and paid one in full. The following is an analysis of the debts:\n1. SOR \u00b6 2.a. credit card checking account delinquent debt of $303 was paid down from over\n$500 but no payments since then (Tr. 64). \n2. SOR \u00b6 2.b. telephone bill of $439 with three payments made on regular schedule (Exhs\n\n4\nG and I 15).\n3. SOR \u00b6 2.c. cable debt of $171. Paid in full (Exhs. I 9 and 14).\n4. SOR \u00b6 2.d. Telephone bill from former residence of $536. No contact with creditor. \n5. SOR \u00b6 2.e. Satellite dish debt of $145. May have been paid but no proof offered. \n6. SOR \u00b6 2.f. Debt of $1,097. No contact with creditor. \n7. SOR \u00b6 2.g. Telephone bill of $728. Creditor contacted but refused partial payment (Tr. 52).\n8. SOR \u00b6 2.h. Telephone bill of $138. Two payments made and paid in full (Exh. I 12). \n9. SOR \u00b6 2.i. and j. Two auto repossessions for $5,900 and $3,790 charged off in 2003. No\ncontact with creditor\u2019s offices although Applicant intends to challenge one of them.\n10. SOR \u00b6 2.k. 2003 tax debt to IRS of $2,253 monthly payments of $75 for over two years\nand now the debt is discharged (Exhs I 16-18). \n11. SOR \u00b6 2. l. 2004 tax debt to IRS of $1, 957. Payments will start to be made on same\nbasis as the 2003 debt. \n12. SOR \u00b6 2.m. 2005 tax debt to IRS of $7,927. No payments now being made. \nApplicant has a GED equivalent and two associates degrees. He is working on a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree. He is married with two children for whom he pays $1,000 per month in child support but is\nbehind in payments of approximately $6,000. He is an hourly employee of his company paid $24 per\nhour. He is well regarded in his company. He has never held a security clearance but seeks one now\nsince because his present work is on a military base and requires access to a secure flight line. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\n\n5\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged under revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective September 1, 2006, for his arrests and convictions and failure to answer correctly Question\n23 on his SF 86 as criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. 1001 for failure to report all of his criminal\nrecord on his SF 86 and in an interview with a Department of Defense investigator. Criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and calls into questions a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses (AG \u00b6 31 a), if an individual is currently on probation (AG \u00b6 31 d), and violation of parole\nor probation (AG \u00b6 31.e). \nThe allegation could be mitigated by the fact the crime was not recent and is unlikely to recur\n(AG \u00b6 32 a) or there is evidence of successful rehabilitation (AG \u00b6 32 d). I conclude Applicant\u2019s\n1991 arrest is mitigated by the passage of time. Although the arrests in 1999 and 2003 also occurred\na number of years ago, they are of a pattern and resulted in an allegation of an outstanding probation\nviolation and a warrant for arrest which has not been resolved. They are not mitigated. However I\nfind that he did not have the requisite deliberate intent required for criminal intent in failing to report\nthe specific of the arrests at Question 23(d and f) on his SF86. He did admit that he had been arrested\nbut did not enumerate the details of the arrests as he should have. The allegation regarding criminal\nconduct under 18 U.S.C. 1001 is mitigated.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under Guideline\nF because an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6 19 a), and a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c).\nMitigating conditions (MC) might include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (AG \u00b6 20 b) and the person has initiated a good\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 d). There is no evidence\nthe debts resulted from conditions beyond his control except the assertion that the cost of living on\n\n6\nthe east coast may have been the cause of some of his financial problems even though he was making\nmore money in his new employment. He has paid one tax delinquency for one year, one of the\nsmallest debts in full, and is paying regularly on three others. Therefore, I find that those are\nmitigated since it is not necessary that all debts be paid, only that a reasonable effort is being made\nto do so. The others remain unpaid, and in several instances, not investigated. They are not mitigated.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his drug arrests and specifics of his probation violations on his\nSF 86 raises issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information. (AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application (AG\n\u00b6 16 a), or to an investigator (AG \u00b6 16 b) could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. Based\non his testimony and the fact that he did acknowledge arrests on the SF 86, I conclude that it was not\ndeliberate as required by the guideline. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a hard-working competent person with family responsibilities who is attempting\nto be a responsible parent. His earlier misconduct appears to be behind him but he has not had the\nability or initiative to resolve his debts and what remains of the issues growing out of his criminal\nrecord. His delinquent debts have accumulated to the point that he lost control of them and was\nunable to resolve them. I believe he intends to resolve the debts when he has the financial means to\ndo so. However, he does not now have the funds to do so now and is unlikely to be in such a position\nin the near future without additional income or a more effective debt management plan.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I decline to grant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

The following questions pertain to the use of illegal\ndrugs or drug activity.

He has a history of four arrests and failed to disclose his arrests and his marijuana use on\nhis security questionnaire in 2006, yet, nevertheless, certified that his answers were truthful.  While\nhe has taken some steps to reform his conduct and entered a court treatment and diversion program\nfor his 2005 possession of marijuana arrest, he has not completed the program.  Thus, he has not yet\ndemonstrated sufficiently his successful rehabilitation.   Consequently, security concerns remain over\nboth criminal conduct and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on December 11, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over personal\n1\nconduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 1 and over criminal conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 2 based\non the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR\nallegations in a notarized Answer of January 9, 2007, where he admitted all allegations in paragraph\n1 and all allegations in paragraph 2.  He requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel indicated the case was ready to proceed on January 30, 2007.  The\nmatter was assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 1, 2007.  The case was re-assigned\nto me on March 29, 2007.  A March 30, 2007, Notice of Hearing set the case hearing for April 19,\n2007. \nAt the hearing the Government offered two exhibits  (Exhibit 1-2) which were admitted into\nevidence without objection.  Applicant testified and submitted Exhibit A, which was admitted into\nevidence without objection.  At the close of the evidentiary portion of the hearing Department\nCounsel moved to amend the SOR based on paragraph 17 of the Directive to add a new allegation,\n2.b.   Applicant initially objected, but later withdrew his objection; he conceded his testimony\n2\n\n3\nsupported the new allegation.  (TR 41-43)  Consequently, I granted the amendment to the SOR.  (TR\n43)  The transcript (TR) was received on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 25 years old, began  work for a defense contractor in a position classified as  Tech\nI in December 2005 and later was promoted to Tech III.  He completed an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigative Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) in January 2006. (Exhibit 1; TR 30-31; 37-38)  \nApplicant received a B.S. in electronics engineering technology from a university in February\n2005. (Exhibit 1) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s first arrest was for trespassing and unlawful discharge of an air gun in August\n2000 when he was 18 and playing paint ball with friends.  He completed his four-month supervision.\n(SOR 1.a.)  (Answer; TR 33-34) \nHis second arrest was in June 2002 when he was twenty as he violated the Liquor Control\nAct.  (SOR 1.b.)  He was outside drinking at a college party; he was arrested by an university police\nofficer who saw him with a drink when he was underage.  He paid a fine. (Answer; TR 34-35)\nHis third arrest for consuming alcohol in public on a patio at a bar was in February 2004\nwhen he was 23.  He was arrested by an officer on a bicycle and required to do ten hours of\ncommunity service.   (SOR 1.d.) (Answer; TR 35-36)\nApplicant began using marijuana in high school and testified his last use of marijuana was\nin November 2005 when he was arrested.  (SOR 1.d..) Applicant certified that his answer were true,\ncomplete and correct on his eQIP; however, in response to questions in Section 24, he falsely\nanswered \u201cno\u201d and failed to disclose that he had previously used drugs.  He was afraid to report his\nmarijuana usage on the form as this job was his first after college and he feared losing it. After\ncompleting the form, he falsely told the security investigator when he was interviewed  that he had\nlast use marijuana in high school.  (TR 27-30)  He admitted he lied.  (TR 31)\nAlso, in response to questions in Section 23, Applicant failed to disclose that he had been\ncharged and convicted of offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  Despite his certification that his\nanswer were true, complete and correct, he falsely answered \u201cno\u201d to that question.  In June 2002  he\nhad pleaded guilty to a violation of the Liquor Control Act and was fined $300; in February 2004\nhe was charged with Consuming Alcohol in Public; and in November 2005 he was arrested and\ncharged with Possession of Marijuana and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.  (Answer; Exhibits 1,\n2) He was arrested when a bicycle police offer came to his car window and saw a marijuana pipe on\nhis dashboard.  He was booked at the police station.  (TR 20) \n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n3\n4\nApplicant conceded he was arrested in November 2005, a month before he filled out the\nsecurity form in January 2006.  He had not heard anything more about the case since his arrest, so\nhe hoped he would not have to report it as he was afraid to disclose the arrest.  He believed he could\nanswer \u201cno\u201d as he had been charged, but had not yet been to court and been convicted of the 2005\narrest.  He thought he was \u201cstill in the clear\u201d when he filled out the form.  After he received the SOR\nin December 2006, he checked with the local courts and found that there was a warrant for him as\nhe had missed a court date.  He had moved, so had not received the notice of the hearing. He went\nto court in March 2007 and was allowed to enter the Treatment Assessment Screening Center\n(TASC) program.  If he completes the program, all charges will be dismissed.   He entered the TASC\ndiversion program and is now in a program and trying to \u201cmake a turnaround.\u201d  (Exhibit A; TR 14-\n15; 16-19; TR 21-25)  To reform his life he moved to a new city for his job in December 2005 and\naway from his previous friends with whom he used drugs. He is paying $250 per month to be in the\nTASC program.  In March 2007 he took a drug education seminar.  (TR 25-27; 30-31; 32)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\n to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n3\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n30.  The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government established security concerns under criminal conduct disqualifying\nconditions as detailed in  \u00b6 31.(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  Applicant had\nfour misdemeanor arrests from ages 18 to 24.  The last arrest in November 2005 was for possession\nof marijuana and drug paraphernalia when he was 24 and is more serious.  In December 2006, he\nchecked with the local courts and found that there was a warrant for him as he had missed a court\ndate. He went to court in March 2007 and was allowed to enter the TASC treatment program.  If he\ncompletes the program, all charges will be dismissed.   \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. It is possible to mitigate\nsecurity concerns under this guideline:  \u00b6 32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns\ninclude: \u00b6 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividuals reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  While his earlier arrests can be mitigated\nunder this test, the recent arrest in 2005 does not meet this test.  To his credit, Applicant finally\nentered TASC and sought therapy in March 2007 to address the underlying issues that led to his drug\nuse.  Applicant has taken some steps on the path to successful rehabilitation but he has not completed\nthe TASC program; so does not yet meet the test that his rehabilitation is successful under MC \u00b6\n32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement. No one yet can conclude with\ncertainty that his misconduct is unlikely to recur.  Thus, doubt does persist over his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  While he reported a satisfactory employment record and has\nbeen promoted, doubts persist over his suitability to have access to classified information.\nConsequently, after looking at him as a whole person and considering the Adjudicative Process\nfactors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b., and 1.c., but\nagainst Applicant on subparagraph 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nGuideline E:  Personal Conduct\n15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe Government provided substantial evidence that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct raised\nsecurity concerns under disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 16:  he falsified his answers to two questions\non the security questionnaire even though he certified that his answers were true.  He failed to\ndisclose his November 2005 drug-related arrest and his marijuana use that continued to November\n\n6\n2005.  \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  However, he admitted\nhe put his self-interest first and intentionally falsified, so he provided  no basis to mitigate.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I\nconclude he is an earnest person who has finally made progress by entering the TASC program, but\nhe has not completed it.  Even though he has reported a favorable employment history, he failed to\nbe truthful on the security questionnaire which raises doubts as to his trustworthiness.\nThus, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to personal conduct considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs\n2.a. and  2.b. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n7\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He had three\nminor alcohol related offenses from 1979 to 1981, before he enlisted. In December 2005, while\nChristmas shopping, he consumed too many strong draft beers during several stops for meals\nbetween noon and early evening, and was arrested for DUI. He is not alcohol dependent and has\ncomplied with or exceeded all conditions of his alcohol treatment program and his pre-trial diversion\nagreement that will result in a suspended sentence for negligent driving. Applicant fully mitigated\nsecurity concerns arising from his alcohol consumption. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 21, 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer filed a NISPOM-required Adverse Information\nReport of his arrest and citation, on December 17, 2005, for driving under the influence of\nintoxicating liquor (DUI). On December 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption), of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not\n1\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant access to classified information, and recommended referral to\nan administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated January 15, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of five of the six factual allegations, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. On March 12, 2007, the case was assigned to another administrative judge,\nwho caused a notice of hearing to be issued on March 15, 2007. Applicant retained counsel who, due\nto unavailability on the scheduled April 12, 2007 hearing date, requested a continuance. That\nadministrative judge found good cause for the continuance, and a notice of hearing cancellation was\nissued on March 30, 2007. The case was then reassigned to me on May 7, 2007. Another notice of\nhearing was issued on May 23, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on June 21, 2007. The\nGovernment offered 8 exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered 13 exhibits that were marked Applicant\nExhibits (AE) A through M, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr) on July 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nGE 1 at 7; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; Tr at 99, 116-117.\n2\nGE 1 at 7; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1; Tr at 117-118.\n3\nGE 1 at 7; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; Tr at 118-119.\n4\nTr at 92-93.\n5\nTr at 109, 111.\n6\nTr at 97-98, 111.\n7\nTr at 110.\n8\n3\nApplicant admitted the truth of some factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nalcohol consumption under AG G (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e (changing the location from one town to\nanother), and 1.f). Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the\nremaining allegation under AG G (\u00b6 1.a). After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old submarine launched ballistic missile technician who has held a\nsecurity clearance since the 1980s, during his 22.5 year Navy career and his employment with a\ndefense contractor that began in 2004. He was born and raised in Germany, where his father was\nstationed with the U.S. military. He moved to the U.S. when he was 18 years old. He began drinking\nbeer in Germany at age 16, where it was legal to do so. Upon return to the U.S., he continued to\ndrink beer, which was also legal in his state where the minimum legal age for beer consumption was\n18 at the time. \nShortly before he turned 19, he was arrested for drunk driving in November 1979. He paid\na $50 fine, attended a ten-week alcohol and substance abuse program, and upon its successful\ncompletion the conviction was reduced to reckless driving.  In December 1980, he was arrested for\n2\ndrinking in public when he and a friend drank a beer in a mall parking lot. He paid a $25 fine for this\nviolation.  In July 1981, at age 20, he was arrested for being drunk in public and fined $35.  He\n3\n4\nenlisted in the Navy in June 1982, advanced to pay grade E-5 by the end of his first enlistment in\n1988, and retired in 2004 at pay grade E-8. He had no disciplinary action, criminal charges, or\nalcohol-related incidents during his Navy career, and held a Top Secret security clearance during the\nvast majority of his service without incident.  After a few months of terminal leave he began\n5\nemployment with his current employer, performing classified work on submarine launched ballistic\nmissiles. \nApplicant has consumed beer throughout most of his adult life, obviously excluding time\nunder way in Navy ships. He does not drink wine or hard liquor.  For a few weeks while he was on\n6\nterminal leave pending retirement during summer 2004, and before he started his current\nemployment, he increased his consumption to three or four beers per day. This would start in the\nafternoon on most days of the week, while working around his home and yard. At his wife\u2019s\nsuggestion, he voluntarily and successfully cut back on that level of consumption.  He testified that\n7\nhe would feel \u201cbuzzed\u201d after about three or four beers.  His current wife has never seen him drink\n8\nto excess and does not feel he has an alcohol problem. His former wife of ten years never had any\n\nAE B at 2, Tr at 58-61.\n9\nGE 7 at 1; GE 8 at 1; Tr at 103-105.

This was not a\n9\npattern of sufficient quantity or duration to constitute either habitual or binge consumption to the\npoint of impaired judgment.\nOn December 17, 2005, Applicant went Christmas shopping. In the course of the afternoon\nand evening, between noon and about 8:30 pm, he consumed some 10 to 11, 16 oz. micro-brew\nbeers.  He also ate lunch and dinner during that period. On his way home, he was stopped for erratic\n10\ndriving and admitted having consumed alcohol. His blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at .181,\nwhich is more than twice the legal limit of .08.  The police report described that his impairment was\n11\nobvious, his coordination was poor, and his speech was slurred. The licensed clinical social worker\nand chemical dependency professional expert who testified for Applicant opined that these reactions\ndemonstrated a lack of tolerance for alcohol and indicated he is not a heavy user. He further opined\nthat the facts \u201cwould appear to be an atypical instance of acute intoxication and not indicative of an\nongoing maladaptive pattern of use that would suggest an abuse diagnosis.\u201d12\nApplicant and his attorney negotiated a pre-trial diversion agreement (PTDA) concerning his\nresulting DUI charge.  His compliance with the agreement is monitored by the prosecutor\u2019s office,\n13\nnot the probation department. Among other things, the agreement requires him to commit no further\nviolations, and not to drive with a BAC above .02 (1/4 the legal limit) for three years, after which\nthe charge will be reduced to Negligent Driving First Degree, with a 90-day jail sentence and $1,000\nfine suspended for two additional years. \nAnother requirement of the PTDA was that Applicant obtain a chemical dependency\nevaluation, and thereafter successfully comply with all treatment recommendations. The court-\nordered evaluation actually pre-dated the final PTDA, and was performed at the local Naval Hospital\nby a \u201cLicensed Independent Practitioner\u201d whose credentials are: \u201cMA, MFT, NCAC II, CDP\u201d.  This\n14\nperson\u2019s actions in Applicant\u2019s case were reviewed and concurred in by a Medical Service Corps\nofficer described in the record as \u201cPsy.D.\u201d No evidence was submitted to define either of these\nindividual\u2019s credentials. Applicant did admit to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f, that he was treated at this\nhospital \u201cfor a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Abuse.\u201d However there is no SOR  allegation that\nthe diagnosis was rendered by a \u201cduly qualified medical professional\u201d as defined in Guideline G \u00b6\n22(d),  or a \u201clicensed clinical social worker under Guideline G \u00b6 22(e), so he did not admit to that\n15\nand there is no evidence that either provider qualified as one. Applicant challenged the competency\nof both the diagnosis and treatment provided by the Licensed Independent Practitioner.

In fact,\n16\nApplicant\u2019s only diagnosis in this program was \u201c305.03 Alcohol Abuse in remission, V62.89 Phase\nof Life Problem.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s prescribed alcohol-related treatment plan was to complete an \u201cIMPACT\u201d course,\ndiscontinue all alcohol use for 90 days, and attend one AA meeting per week for four weeks. His\nfollow\u2013up treatment at the hospital itself was just three counseling sessions of individual therapy to\naddress phase of life/circumstance problems.   Applicant did successfully complete the treatment\n17\nprogram prescribed for him, has not had any alcohol-related incidents since December 2005, and\nremains in full compliance with the pre-trial diversion agreement. The Navy counselor who\ndiagnosed \u201calcohol abuse in remission,\u201d also \u201cfelt there was no potential for his alcohol use to\nimpact his ability to safeguard classified information or impact his judgment or reliability. . . [and]\nhad no reason not to recommend him for a position impacting the national security.\u201d  Applicant has\n18\nnot consumed any alcohol since March 2007. He and his wife engage in significant physical fitness\nactivities and practice a health-conscious lifestyle.19\nApplicant was independently evaluated by a licensed independent clinical social worker who\nis a fully qualified clinician and active in undergraduate and graduate level education and training.20\nHe testified that he performed an Alcohol/Drug Evaluation on Applicant, including two standard\nassessment instrument, and concluded that he demonstrated insufficient evidence of substance\nabuse/dependence. His recollection, and his report, indicated that Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related\nincidents from 1979 to1981 were not included in the evaluation, although Applicant testified that\nhe did reveal them. In response to hypothetical questions, he said that the existence of such incidents\nmore than 25 years before the 2005 DUI arrest would have been relevant to his evaluation, but\nprobably would not have changed his diagnosis since the DSM IV requires multiple, recurrent\nadverse incidents within a 12-month period to support a diagnosis of substance abuse.   \nApplicant submitted three declarations and a letter of recommendation from current and\nformer co-workers, supervisors and social associates. One witness also testified concerning his\nextensive personal knowledge of, and experiences with Applicant. These sources were unanimous\nin their positive evaluation and recommendations concerning his character, work performance,\nresponsible alcohol use, trustworthiness and reliability.\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n21\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n22\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n23\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n24\n6\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n21\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n22\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n23\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n24\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n26\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nRegulation, Appendix 8, Guideline G \u00b6 21.\n27\n7\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n25\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n26\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\" so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\nunfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d  The SOR alleged, and Appellant admitted to, three pre-service alcohol-related\n27\narrests and convictions between 1979 and 1981, for which he was fined a total of $110, and one DUI\narrest in December 2005, concerning which he entered into a pre-trial diversion agreement with\nwhich he remains in full compliance. These incidents raise possible security concerns under alcohol\nconsumption disqualifying condition (AC DC) 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent\u201d). \n\n\u201cThe essential feature of Substance Abuse is a maladaptive pattern of substance use manifested by recurrent\n28\nand significant adverse consequences related to the repeated use of substances. There may be repeated failure to fulfill\nmajor role obligations, repeated use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, multiple legal problems, and\nrecurrent social and interpersonal problems. These problems must occur recurrently during the same 12-month period.\n8\nHe has had no alcohol-related incident at work (AC DC 22(b)). I conclude that he has not\nengaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment (AC DC\n22(c)). His three youthful arrests occurred over a period of more than 18 months, and only the first\nand last involved any level of intoxication. All three were addressed with minor fines, indicating the\nde minimis nature of the incidents. There is no evidence of irresponsibly excessive drinking at any\ntime thereafter until his December 2005 DUI arrest. He did consume sufficient beer that day to test\nat .181 when stopped. However, his consumption involved drinking two or three beers at each of\nthree or four different stops involving two meals and an afternoon snack during an eight-hour\nafternoon and evening of Christmas shopping. While this became carelessly excessive, I do not judge\nthis to be binge consumption, and there is no evidence he did this habitually. SOR \u00b6 1.a is vaguely\nworded to imply a 29 year period of intoxication and excessive alcohol consumption, which\nApplicant formally denied. He did consume alcohol intermittently over the period alleged, and there\nwere shown to be three incidents in 1979, 1981, and 2005, when he drank too much. I do not find\nthis raises security concerns as habitual or binge drinking other than those already raised under AC\nDC 22(a). Should they do so, however, the same analysis of mitigating factors discussed below\npertains to these concerns.\nApplicant did not admit, and there is not substantial evidence to establish, that his naval\nhospital chemical dependency evaluation of \u201cAlcohol Abuse in remission\u201d was rendered by a duly\nqualified medical professional (AC DC 22(d)) or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program (AC DC 22(e)). Accordingly, the government\ndid not meet its initial burden of production on this disputed fact. Nor do I conclude that \u201cAlcohol\nAbuse in remission\u201d necessarily qualifies as a diagnosis of alcohol abuse under this guideline. Even\nabsent these deficiencies, Applicant demonstrated conclusively that his one-time alcohol incident\ndoes not meet the DSM IV criteria for a competent medical diagnosis of alcohol abuse.  I do not\n28\ninterpret this guideline to mean that abusing alcohol one time meets the disqualifying condition per\nse, and I find the counselor\u2019s determination that the DUI was alcohol abuse is insufficient in itself\nto establish either AC DC.  Applicant also demonstrated that the treatment program he successfully\ncompleted was not one that would be prescribed for clinically diagnosed alcohol abuse. Accordingly,\nneither AC DC 22(d) nor AC DC 22(e) apply.\nThere is neither an allegation nor any evidence of relapse after completion of an alcohol\nrehabilitation program or failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation,\ntreatment, or abstinence. To the contrary, Applicant has complied with all court-ordered education,\nevaluation, treatment and abstinence resulting from his two DUI arrests (occurring 26 years apart)\nand, barring another offense in the next 18 months, neither will result in conviction for DUI. Neither\nAC DC 22(f) nor AC DC 22(g) apply. Only AC DC 22(a) raises potential security concerns.\nI have considered potentially applicable alcohol consumption mitigating conditions in light\nof the facts and circumstances established by the evidence. Application of mitigating conditions must\nbe assessed in light of the entire record, not by viewing any particular incident solely in isolation.\n\n9\nAC MC 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies to mitigate security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s four admitted arrests both individually and collectively. One of the\nthree that occurred over 25 years ago involved nothing more than drinking a beer in a mall parking\nlot. The other two were some 18 months apart and involved intoxication, but he was very immature\nand subsequently served a highly successful and responsible naval career of more than 22 years\nwithout further incident. He admittedly committed one DUI violation in December 2005 when he\nmisjudged his degree of intoxication and consumed additional strong beers at a series of stops during\nan afternoon and evening of holiday shopping. Considering the absence of any other alcohol-related\nincident during the preceding 25 years or the 18 months since that night, the absence of substance\ndependency or clinically significant abuse, and his successful compliance with every post-arrest\ntreatment and abstinence conditions, Applicant has proven under AC MC 23(a) that the these\nincidents, individually and collectively, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness\nor judgment, and that alcohol abuse is unlikely to recur.\nAC MC 23(b) (\u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\u201d) also applies in\nmitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns. He listed his three pre-service incidents on both\nrecord security clearance applications and promptly reported his 2005 arrest to proper authorities.\nBoth the Navy and the private alcohol counselors who evaluated him found him to be completely\nforthright and cooperative concerning his DUI incident. He complied with the treatment regimen and\nhas practiced either extended periods of abstinence or responsible use of alcohol ever since. \nAC MC 23(c) (\u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress\u201d) does not apply because he already successfully completed his counseling or treatment\nprogram. Finally, AC MC 23(d) (\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d)\nalso applies.  Should the Navy counselor, under supervision of the Medical Service Corps officer be\ndeemed to be either a qualified medical professional or an alcohol treatment program staff licensed\nclinical social worker for purposes of AC DC 22(d) or AC DC 22(e), then any security concerns\narising thereunder are mitigated by his clear favorable prognosis after Applicant successfully\ncompleted his counseling and rehabilitation program. In any event, the private social worker who\ntestified for Applicant fully qualifies, and also rendered a very favorable prognosis.  \nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. He committed three minor alcohol-related offenses more than\n25 years ago and before he began a highly successful naval career involving work in highly classified\n\n10\nprograms. He committed one DUI offense during the pre-holiday season in 2005, which he freely\ndisclosed and admitted, and for which he has fully complied with all conditions of the resulting pre-\ntrial diversion agreement. While his level of intoxication was significant, he caused neither property\ndamage nor any personal injury. He did not set out either to get drunk or to commit a DUI, but\ninstead misjudged his level of intoxication over the course of several stops to eat meals with which\nhe drank the beer. \nApplicant fully recognizes and understands his error, and has had no subsequent irresponsible\nalcohol consumption. The three old incidents occurred when he was 19 and 20 years old, and shortly\nafter he moved to the U.S. after being raised in Germany where beer consumption is common and\naccepted. He was fully mature and accountable for the  2005 incident, however. He has demonstrated\nrehabilitation, to the extent rehabilitation pertains to not repeating a one-time bad exercise of\njudgment, and permanent behavioral changes to an exercise and fitness oriented lifestyle involving\nlittle to no alcohol consumption. Since his family, coworkers and employer are fully aware of the\nrecent incident, there is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.  \nI find the likelihood of continuation or recurrence to be as low as is possible to predict in the\nuncertain world of human behavior. Any subsequent incident, however, would certainly support\nimmediate suspension of any security clearance and action to revoke it. The low risk of recurrence,\ntherefore, does not carry any concomitant risk to the national security. Applicant\u2019s current and\nformer supervisors and coworkers unanimously vouch for his character, excellent performance,\nresponsibility, reliability and trustworthiness. He has dedicated more than 25 years of unblemished\nand demanding service in the strategic defense of the United States. Accordingly, although Appellant\nadmitted the factual truth off the allegations in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.f,  I find that he has fully mitigated\nthe security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption. It is clearly in the interest of national\nsecurity to continue his access to classified material or protected information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

I make the following findings: Applicant is a 51-year-old field engineer for a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from December 1974 to December 1977 and from October 1980 to December 1997. He held a security clearance while he was on active duty.

On July 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 6, 2007; answered the \nSOR on August 16, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 21, 2007.  The case was \nassigned to an administrative judge on September 24, 2007, and reassigned to me on \nOctober 24, 2007, based on workload.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \nJanuary 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n1, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 15, 2007. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted one exhibit, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which \nwas admitted without objection.  \n \nI kept the record open to enable Applicant to submit additional matters.  He \ntimely submitted AX B, C, and D, and they were admitted without objection.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX B, C, and D are attached to the record \nas Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. The record closed on November 30, 2007.  DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 13, 2007.  Based upon my review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nThe hearing was convened less than 15 days after the notice of hearing was \nissued.  I advised Applicant of his right under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 to written notice 15 \ndays before the hearing.  Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days written \nnotice. (HX II; Tr. 18.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a and \npart of \u00b6 1.b with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a.  His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old field engineer for a defense contractor.  He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Army from December 1974 to December 1977 and from October \n1980 to December 1997.  He held a security clearance while he was on active duty.  He \nhas bachelor\u2019s degrees in organizational management and counseling (Tr. 8).  He has \nworked for his current employer since December 1997, and he has held his current \nsecurity clearance for about 10 years.  His operations manager, who has known him for \nmore than 20 years, describes him as a level-headed person of integrity, responsibility, \nand character above reproach (AX C at 2). \n \n \nApplicant was married in November 1980.  He has two sons, ages 27 and 26, \nand a 14-year-old daughter (Tr. 31).  His younger son was born severely handicapped, \nunable to walk until he was four years old.  He still is incapable of living alone.  \nApplicant was on active duty for the first 16 years of his disabled son\u2019s life, leaving his \nwife almost solely responsible for his care (Tr. 59-60). \n \n \nIn July 2004, Applicant voluntarily disclosed to his security manager that he was \nreceiving psychiatric counseling for depression and had been prescribed anti-\ndepressant medication (Tr. 34-35; AX A).  His medical records reflect a diagnosis of \nmajor depression, moderate, recurrent, and history of alcohol abuse (GX 6).  With his \n\n \n3 \n \n \npsychiatrist\u2019s approval, Applicant stopped taking anti-depressant medication in April \n2006 (Tr. 55).  He now deals with stress by participating in a therapy group at his \nchurch, doing yoga, meditating, and participating in vigorous physical exercise (Tr. 56). \n \n \nWhen Applicant executed his SF 86, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 19, asking if \nhe had consulted with a mental health professional in the last seven years (GX 1 at 5).  \nHe testified that his negative answer to question 19 was an inadvertent mistake.  He \nhad discussed his criminal record with his security manager a few minutes before \ncompleting the SF 86 and was focused on updating his criminal record.  He also was \ncomparing his answers to a previous SF 86, on which question 19 was correctly \nanswered in the negative.  These factors caused him to incorrectly answer \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 19, even though he had previously disclosed to his security manager that he \nwas receiving psychiatric counseling (Tr. 34).   \n \n \nApplicant believes that the stress of caring for their handicapped son was a major \nproblem in his marriage (Tr. 59). The marriage began to deteriorate rapidly around the \nsummer of 2003, with numerous arguments about many issues (Tr. 40).  \n \n \nDuring the summer of 2004, Applicant was contacted by a woman with whom he \nhad a serious romantic relationship when he was younger and before his met his wife.  \nThe woman, although married, invited Applicant to visit her at her home in another \nstate.  Applicant seriously considered accepting the invitation but then thought better of \nit.  His wife found out about the invitation.  Applicant admitted to his wife that he had \nreceived the invitation and contemplated accepting it.  According to Applicant, his wife \nwould not give him the opportunity to explain their previous relationship (Tr. 39).    \n \n \nIn early December 2004 Applicant and his wife again argued. On the night of \nDecember 7, 2004, they made up, and Applicant went to work on December 8, thinking \neverything was fine.  He did not know his wife complained to the police and obtained a \ntemporary restraining order prohibiting all contact.  He was served with the restraining \norder at work, and he moved to a hotel (Tr. 36).   \n \n \nOn December 21, 2004, the day the temporary restraining order was to expire, \nApplicant sent an email to his wife, saying they needed to talk (Tr. 38).; GX 4 at 2).  In \nthe email (GX 4 at 2), he told his wife he backed out of the other woman\u2019s invitation, \n\u201cbecause you are the one that I love.\u201d  He explained: \u201cIn spite of thinking about sinning, I \ndid not sin.  I was going to tell you.  Sorry for lying.\u201d  Applicant and his wife were due in \ncourt for a hearing to determine whether the restraining order should be continued or \nterminated, and Applicant expected the restraining order would be terminated and his \nwife would not read the email until after the hearing (Tr. 39-40).  His wife showed the \nemail to the police, who arrested Applicant for violating the restraining order, a \nmisdemeanor (GX 4 at 1, 3).  \n \n \nOn January 8, 2005, his wife obtained a permanent restraining order.  Three \ndays later, his wife invited him to her house to talk, and he accepted the invitation.  They \nmet and talked more than 60 times, met several times at restaurants, his place of work, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand her residence. He broke off contact in late February or early March 2005, after his \nwife\u2019s attorney called him and told him his wife was very upset by his conduct.  In April \n2005, the police arrested Applicant for violating the restraining order, harassment, and \nstalking (GX 2 at 4; GX 4 at 6).  All the charged offenses were misdemeanors (GX 5 at \n3).  \n \n \nThe stalking charge was based on Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s claim that he was following \nher.  According to Applicant, his wife drove to the park where he had been running for \n15 years, went to the YMCA where he exercised, and went to another YMCA when \nApplicant switched locations to avoid his wife (Tr. 43). \n \n \nThe district attorney offered to dismiss the violation of the first restraining order if \nApplicant would plead guilty to violating the second restraining order, harassment, and \nstalking.  Applicant agreed, contrary to the advice of his lawyer (Tr. 45).  He was fined \n$1,500, spent 17 days in jail on work release, and was placed on probation for two \nyears (GX 2 at 4).  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied harassing or stalking his wife.  He testified he \nthought he was pleading guilty only to violating the second restraining order, and did not \nrealize until a couple of weeks later that he had pleaded guilty to harassment and \nstalking (Tr. 44-45). \n \n \nIn October 2005, the restraining order was modified to permit both parents to \nattend school events and to communicate by cell phone about their minor daughter (Tr. \n53-54; AX C).  Applicant and his wife were divorced in November 2005.  His probation \nwas terminated in March 2007 (AX D at 4).  He and his wife now meet in a public place \nto arrange visits with his daughter.  His handicapped son lives with him for six months \nand his ex-wife for six months (Tr. 58).  There have been no incidents between \nApplicant and his ex-wife since the restraining order was modified (Tr. 57). \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his criminal record to his security manager and reported it in \nresponse to question 26 on his SF 86 (Tr. 34; GX 1 at 7).  His supervisor, coworkers, \ntwo sisters, and several close friends also know about his criminal record; and his ex-\nwife, supervisor, coworkers, security manager, and friends know about his psychiatric \ncounseling (GX 2 at 3-4). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Clearance decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was arrested in December 2004 for violating a \nrestraining order (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and arrested in April 2005 for violating a restraining order, \nharassment, and stalking (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The first charge was dismissed pursuant to a \nplea agreement and the second resulted in a conviction pursuant to Applicant\u2019s guilty \nplea.   \n \nThe SOR also alleges Applicant falsified his SF 86.  The allegation of falsification \nis alleged as both criminal conduct under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and personal conduct \nunder Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  His alleged falsification is discussed below under \nGuideline E. \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d  AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a single violation of a restraining order.  SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges \nmultiple violations of a second restraining order.  Applicant admitted both allegations.  \nBased on his admissions and the evidence of record, I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) \nare raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(a).  Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct was preceded by more than 27 years of honorable military service \nwhile holding a security clearance.  The causes of Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior are no \nlonger present. The criminal conduct occurred while Applicant was undergoing \npsychiatric counseling for major depression, and it was motivated by his desire to save \nhis marriage.  He finally realized that he could not save his marriage, and he was \ndivorced in November 2005.  Since that time, the restraining order has been modified; \nhe and his ex-wife have agreed on visitation arrangements for their minor daughter; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthey have agreed to share care-giving for their disabled son.  No further incidents \nbetween them have occurred.  \n \n \nApplicant has responded successfully to psychiatric counseling, no longer \nrequires anti-depressant medications, and has found alternate ways to cope with stress.  \nThroughout his domestic difficulties, he continued to demonstrate integrity, \nresponsibility, and good character at work.  He continued to hold a security clearance \nwithout incident.  I conclude that his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur, and it does not \ncast doubt on his present reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Accordingly, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct also can be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n32(d).  Applicant\u2019s conviction is almost three years old.  He has completed his period of \nprobation, and the court has modified the restraining order to allow limited contact with \nhis wife.  No misconduct has occurred since his conviction.  His work performance has \nnever faltered in spite of his difficulties.  He is actively involved in a counseling and \nsupport group sponsored by his church.  He has changed his lifestyle to deal with stress \nin a productive and acceptable manner.  At the hearing, he expressed embarrassment \nand remorse for his conduct.  I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a alleged Applicant falsified his SF 86 by deliberately \nfailing to disclose his psychiatric treatment and medication.  The concern under \nGuideline E is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.   \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nomission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s denial of intent to falsify his SF 86 is corroborated by his voluntary \ndisclosure of his psychiatric counseling more than a year before he executed his SF 86.  \nHe presented himself at the hearing as sincere and open.  I found his explanation for his \nnegative answer to question 19 plausible and credible.  I am satisfied his negative \nresponse to question 19 was an inadvertent mistake and not an intentional falsification.  \nAccordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not raised.  Applicant has refuted the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a, and I resolve them in his favor.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of these factors \nwere addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult.  He has spent most of his adult life in \ngovernment service, either as a soldier or as an employee of a defense contractor.  He \nhas held a security clearance for most of his professional life, without incident.  His \ncriminal conduct arose as the culmination of a troubled marriage, exacerbated by his \nbouts of depression and triggered by his confession to his ex-wife that he had \nconsidered infidelity but decided against it because of his continuing love for her.  \nAlthough Applicant knew he was violating the restraining orders, it appears that his ex-\nwife was complicit in his violations and used them to extract revenge for his thoughts of \ninfidelity.  Applicant has overcome his problems with depression and ended his \nmarriage, thereby removing the causes of his criminal conduct.  He is remorseful for his \nthoughts of infidelity and ill-advised attempts to save his marriage.  At the hearing, he \nwas sincere, open, and credible. \n \nApplicant has been rehabilitated and has changed his life-style to avoid further \nproblems with depression.  The likelihood of recurring criminal conduct is very remote.  \nHe has been candid with his family, supervisors, security officer, coworkers, and friends \nabout his criminal record and his treatment for depression, eliminating his vulnerability \nto pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has refuted the allegation that he falsified his SF 86, and he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on his violations of the restraining orders.  Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On April 2, 2007,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d through 1.n, and 1.s.  Those\n1\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\nDecision at 7.\n2\n2\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 26, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E.\nMalone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that Applicant had paid\n15 of her 22 debts in full, made payment arrangements with respect to another four, enrolled in a\nfinancial budgeting class, and as a result had reduced her outstanding indebtedness from $15,000 to\n$5,000.  She also notes that she has been a good, dependable employee, who has never mishandled\nsensitive information.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nIn his decision, the Judged noted that Applicant\u2019s work record had been impressive and that\nshe had held a position of public trust without incident since 2002.   The Judge also found that\n2\nApplicant had resolved certain debts and that in 2007 she attended a financial management class.\nHowever, such factors were not wholly dispositive of the case.  The federal government need not\nwait until an applicant actually mishandles sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access\nto such information.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).\nTrustworthiness determinations are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance\nor conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's\ntrustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An\napplicant with exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness\nimplications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\ntrustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  Such an analysis is not confined to the workplace.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 06-13629 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nand whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 1, 2006).  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\ntrustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\n\nDecision at 6 and 7.\n3\nDecision at 6-7.\n4\nDecision at 6.\n5\n3\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 06-23881 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, which arose from an over reliance on credit cards, poor financial practices, and\nprocrastination.   At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant delinquent debts and was\n3\nstill in the process of resolving her financial problems.  Therefore, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ADP Case No. 05-16601\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  He gave Applicant some\ncredit for the fact that she had received guidance on financial management and had resolved many\nof her debts.   As a result, he found in her favor with respect to most of the SOR allegations.\n4\nHowever, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns\u2014noting in\nparticular that Applicant had waited to resolve her outstanding indebtedness until after she had\nreceived the DOHA interrogatories and it was clear that her eligibility for access to sensitive\ninformation was in jeopardy.   The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\n5\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2006).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination under Guidelines F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. A\n1\nmemorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA\nDirector, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of trustworthiness cases for\nADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as originally drafted, DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions designated as ADP I or\nADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III positions are nonsensitive\npositions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however, even though they are\nnonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and\nprocedures as ADP I and II cases.\n Ax. P; Tr., 58, 63.\n2\n Gx. 1; Tr., 61 - 62.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 23, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On April 7,\n2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on June 29, 2007, and I convened a hearing on August 7, 2007, at which the parties appeared as\nscheduled. The government offered six exhibits, all of which were admitted without objection (Gx.\n1 - 6). Applicant testified and introduced 21 exhibits (Ax. A - U), which were admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged through the SOR that Applicant owes $14,112 in delinquent debt\nfor 21 unpaid accounts, 13 of which (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.m) are unpaid medical accounts referred to\ncollection agencies. The remaining accounts are commercial accounts for credit cards or consumer\nservices referred for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.r - 1.u) or charged off as business losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o -\n1.q). Applicant admitted all of the allegations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.t.\nHer admissions to the remaining allegations are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review\nof the transcript and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 42 years old, has never been married, and works as a claims associate for a large\nhealth care and medical insurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and\ninformation for TRICARE, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military\npersonnel and their families. She is a single mother of three, one of whom is a grown adult. One\nchild is in college, and her tuition is being financed through scholarships, grants, and student loans.2\nApplicant\u2019s youngest child, age 3, still resides with Applicant. The father of her youngest child has\nonly occasionally paid child support, and Applicant intends to seek a court order to force him to pay\ncurrent and past due support.3\n\n Tr., 76 - 79.\n4\n Gx. 5.\n5\n Ax.

O.\n9\n4\nFrom September 1989 until February 2001, Applicant worked as a secretary and payroll clerk\nfor an electrical manufacturing company. During that period, she had two miscarriages, the second\nof which occurred in February 2001. It was around this time that she lost her job when the company\nmoved its operations to Mexico, and was unemployed until September 2001, when she was hired\nby her current employer. While unemployed, she relied for income on short-term disability benefits\nand unemployment payments. Her health benefits paid for the costs of her first miscarriage, but the\ncoverage was unavailable after she was laid off. In December 2001, Applicant suffered another\nmiscarriage and missed two weeks of work without benefit of medical leave because she was still\nclassified as a new employee.4\nIn 2002, Applicant applied for and was granted a position of trust, which is required as part\nof her current job duties. On the SF 85P she submitted, she disclosed she was more than 180 days\ndelinquent on a single credit card account. When she applied for a periodic reinvestigation in 2004,\nshe disclosed the same delinquent credit card account. A credit report obtained as part of the ensuing\nbackground investigation showed Applicant owed the debts listed in the SOR, most of which had\nbeen referred for collection.5\nSeveral of the debts listed in Applicant\u2019s credit report are for medical services related to her\nmiscarriages and to the birth of her youngest child in 2003 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d - 1.g, 1.i, 1.k).\nApplicant also became delinquent on other debts related to her own medical care (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j,\n1.l, 1.m). The listed medical delinquencies totaled $5,124. In 2006, she paid the debts listed the debts\nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d - 1.f, and 1.h, which total $4,620.  Applicant also has paid most of the\n6\nremaining $504 medical debts.7\nApplicant also owed another $6,960 in delinquent debts consisting of an unpaid cable TV\naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.n), an unpaid jewelry store account (SOR \u00b6 1.o), five delinquent credit card or\npersonal loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p - 1.r, 1.t, and 1.u), and an unpaid telephone service account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.s). Of these debts, she has paid or resolved the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.n and \u00b6 1.s.  \n8\nApplicant resolved the credit card debts listed in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.u by enrolling in debt\nrehabilitation plans run by each card company. She now has a different version of each card and her\naccounts are current for credit reporting purposes. But she pays a higher interest rate and will have\na lower credit limit when she pays down a lower amount owed by the terms of her settlement. She\npays about $35 monthly to each plan.9\n\n Ax.

U.\n16\n5\nApplicant also has paid about half of the $751 she owed on the jewelry store listed in SOR\n\u00b6 1.o, and she continues to pay $50 each month on this debt. It became delinquent because she forgot\nabout it.  She still has not resolved the $3,400 in unpaid credit card debt listed in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and\n10\n1.q.\nThe $2,028 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for unpaid orthodontic services provided for\nApplicant\u2019s middle child in 2003. Applicant contends she is not obligated to pay this debt because\nshe was dissatisfied with the care provided,  but did not provide any documentation of her dispute.\n11\nApplicant has been steadily employed since September 2001. Applicant has full medical\ncoverage, but it extends only to herself and not her children because the extra coverage takes too\nmuch out of her paycheck.  All but three (SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.r) of Applicant\u2019s debts arose after\n12\nshe began working for her current employer. In June 2006, a government investigator interviewed\nApplicant about her debts, but it was not until she received DOHA interrogatories about her finances\nin December 2006 that she began paying or trying to resolve her debts. As part of her response to\ninterrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) that showed she had a\npositive monthly cash flow of about $760.  \n13\nIn April and May 2007, Applicant attended a financial management class. She asserts she\nlearned a great deal about personal finances and she intends to attend the second part of the class in\nSeptember 2007.  Applicant has acknowledged she relied too much on credit cards in recent years\n14\nand now knows her financial limitations.  Applicant\u2019s job performance over the past six years has\n15\nbeen outstanding. She has completed virtually every training requirement and opportunity offered\nby her employer. She has also greatly exceeded the performance standards for her position.\nAssociates at both her current and former job speak highly of her integrity and reliability, and fully\nsupport her request for eligibility.16\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President\n17\non December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Directive, 6.3.\n18\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2 lists the following factors: \u201c(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of\n19\nthe conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2.\n20\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531(1988).\n21\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n22\n6\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n17\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information. Each trustworthiness determination must\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each\nadjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case, as well as a fair and\nimpartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and material information.  The\n18\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to sensitive information. Further, the decision must include \u201cthe careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables  known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the\n19\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a\ndetermination.\u201d20\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to\nsensitive  information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information\non which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must\nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with\nsecurity clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden\n21\nof persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. Resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position should be resolved in\nfavor of the government.22\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n23\n \u201c(a) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (c) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n24\n \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\n25\nproblem is being resolved or is under control;\u201d\n \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n26\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\u201d\n27\n MC 20(c): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.\n28\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n23\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations that Applicant owed at\nleast $14,000 in delinquent debts accrued between 2000 and 2006. Available information further\nshowed she did not pay or otherwise resolve any of those debts until the last six months of 2006, and\nthat she still owes about $5,400 of the delinquencies alleged in the SOR. These facts require\nconsideration of Guideline F disqualifying conditions 19(a) and 19(c).  \n24\nOf the Guideline F mitigating conditions (MC) potentially applicable to these facts, only MC\n20(c)  has some basis for consideration. Applicant recently attended a financial management course\n25\nand will attend a second such course in September. However, while she has increased her awareness\nof sound financial management practices, she has yet to establish a financial track record sufficient\nto overcome the security concerns about her past financial problems. Her financial problems, a large\nportion of which arose from over-reliance on credit cards, were multiple in nature and continued as\nrecently as 2006, thus precluding consideration of MC 20(a).  It is to her benefit that she has paid\n26\nor resolved many of her debts. However, because she waited until she received the DOHA\ninterrogatories and it was clear her eligibility for access was in jeopardy before doing so, her actions\ndo not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve her obligations as contemplated by MC 20(d).  \n27\nAs to the possibility her debts arose due to circumstances beyond her control,  Applicant\n28\nclaimed her debts were caused by either her six-month period of unemployment in 2001 and/or by\nthree consecutive miscarriages. However, she did not present evidence showing how, if at all, those\nevents prevented her from paying her debts earlier than she did. She acknowledged that she used\ncredit cards too much after 2001, and she has had medical coverage for all but a brief period since\nshe has held her current job. But Applicant did not explain why she could not pay for her own\nmedical care. Even allowing for the possibility that her medical debts were caused by unforeseen\ncircumstances, they have been in place since 2003 and Applicant has had sufficient income and\npositive monthly cash flow to enable her to resolve her debts sooner than she did. As to her credit\n\n \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\n29\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue;\u201d\n \u201c (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\n30\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n31\n Directive, 6.3. \n32\n8\ncard, jewelry, and other delinquent debts, Applicant has not provided information that would support\nany of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s claim she is contesting the unpaid\n$2,000 orthodontist bill (SOR \u00b6 1.c) is uncorroborated by the record, and MC 20(e)  may not be\n29\nconsidered. On balance, available information is insufficient to overcome the security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented by all of the available information, and\nI have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline F. I have also\nreviewed the record in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant is a mature adult who is only now learning how to manage her\n30\nfinances. Her work record is impressive and she has held a position of trust without incident since\n2002. To her credit, she has paid more than half the total delinquent debt alleged in the SOR.\nHowever, her claims that her financial problems are the result of her medical problems and\nunemployment in 2001, are greatly attenuated by the passage of nearly six years, and she incurred\nsignificant delinquent personal credit debt after obtaining steady income. She has had a positive\nmonthly cash flow, which she could have used to resolve many of the more modest debts well before\nit was clear the government was concerned about her finances. \nThe combination of her poor financial practices and procrastination in resolving her debts\nserves to sustain the concerns about her finances and her judgment related thereto. Any doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  It is laudable that she has received formal guidance on how to manage her\n31\nmoney and that she has reduced her overall debt. And while the mere presence of unpaid debts is not\nper se disqualifying, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information shows that\n32\nthe Applicant has not yet overcome the doubts about her ability to exercise the requisite good\njudgment and discretion expected of one in a position of trust. Accordingly, I cannot conclude from\nall of the available information that she has demonstrated permanent changes in her financial\npractices sufficient to show that her problems will not recur in the future.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the information presented, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\nMatthew E.

He has not presented information to mitigate security concerns for\nfinancial considerations.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), using the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), issued by the President on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  The revised\nguidelines were provided Applicant and he was aware that the case would be adjudicated under those\nguidelines.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 27, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response.  He admitted 11 and denied\nfour of the allegations under Guideline F, and provided some explanation for his delinquent debts.\nHe elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.1\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 23, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on April 4, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  On May 1, 2007, he responded with information similar to his response to the SOR.

An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n10\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.11\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n12\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.13\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n14\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n15\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n16\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n17\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 18\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\n\n5\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts verified by credit reports and admitted, in part, by Applicant\nbrings the matter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a) Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, DC \u00b6 19(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending\nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt, DC \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and DC \u00b6 19(e) consistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative\ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.  Bankruptcy is a legal and\npermissible means of resolving indebtedness.  However, the circumstances leading to the bankruptcy\nand an individual\u2019s financial actions after the bankruptcy must be examined to determine the\nindividual\u2019s suitability and eligibility for access to classified information.  Applicant provided little\nexplanation how or why each delinquent debt was accumulated.  The debts were accumulated because\nhe was spending more than he had the ability to pay.  While he states he contacted the tax authority\nand is paying his student loans, he has not established a realistic plan to pay his debts.  He has\nexcessive indebtedness starting with his bankruptcy in 2004 followed by more delinquent\nindebtedness.  He has excessive indebtedness and high debt in relation to his cash flow as indicated\nby the high asset to liability ratio in his bankruptcy and subsequent delinquent debt after the\nbankruptcy discharge.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nApplicant\u2019s debts include tax liens, student loans, utility debts, and bank loans.  Most are still\noutstanding.  Since there is a variety of  debts, which are still current, and there is no indication the\ndebts would not recur Financial Consideration Mitigating Condition (MC) \u00b6 20(a) The behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment does not apply.  There is no indication Applicant received counseling concerning his finances\nso MC \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control also does not apply. \nAs noted above, once the government presents information to raise a security concern,\nApplicant has the burden to present information to rebut, refute, explain, or mitigate the security\n\n6\nconcerns.  Applicant stated his tax liens were caused by divorce and a business closure raising\nFinancial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (MC) \u00b6 20(b) The conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstance.  However, he presented no information concerning the business\nclosure or how or why the divorce or business closure affected his ability to responsibly pay his\nobligations.  Likewise, he raised MC 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or other wise resolve debt when he stated he paid two debts in full and was making payments\non his student loans.  He presented no information to verify any payments of the debts or the student\nloans.  His statements alone, without any proof or documentation, is not sufficient to rebut, refute,\nexplain, or mitigate the information presented by the government in the allegations. I find Applicant\nhas not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns for financial considerations.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a position of public trust.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested the case be\ndecided on the written record.  On July 30, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nThomas M. Crean, denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination should be reversed\nbecause Applicant\u2019s last criminal offense occurred more than five years ago and he has completed\na substance abuse program.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\nIn support of his argument, Applicant offers new evidence\u2014a copy of his certificate of\ncompletion of an alcohol and substance abuse program.   The Board may not consider this new\n1\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its submission does not demonstrate error on the part\nof the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00184 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at\n7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided upon the written record\u2014a circumstance under\nwhich the Judge did not question the Applicant about his concerns and evaluate his credibility in the\ncontext of a hearing.  In response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant\ndeclined to submit any evidence.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\nerred in concluding that the Guideline J allegations had not been mitigated\u2014given the record in this\ncase.  Although Applicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s decision, he has not established that it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn his decision, the Judge weighed the available mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nfactors.  He reasonably explained why the available mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\n\n3\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-17714 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nGiven the limited record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Eligibility is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny an application for a position of public\ntrust for Applicant.  The action was taken under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), using the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), issued by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1,\n2006.  The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant and he was aware that the case would be\nadjudicated under those guidelines.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 15,\n2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on February 23, 2007, admitting all eight factual allegations under\nGuideline J with an explanation for his conduct.  He elected to have the matter decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on May 10, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on May 16, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.

The standard that must be met is that based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.6\nThe Regulation sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making trustworthiness determinations,\nand lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  The adjudicative\nguideline at issue in this case is:\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A security concern exists because criminal actions creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.7\nConditions that could raise an eligibility concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate eligibility concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a position of public trust.

An applicant has\n11\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to occupy\na position of public trust.   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\n12\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   Any\n13\ndoubt as to whether eligibility for a position of public trust is clearly consistent with national security\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.   Each eligibility decision must be fair, impartial,\n14\nand a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole\nperson concept, and the factors listed in new adjudicative guidelines.  A person granted a position of\npublic trust enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to\nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants such a position.\nThe decision to deny an individual a public trust position is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant.   It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines\n15\nestablished for eligibility for a public trust position.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThere is a statutory prohibition to granting a security clearance for an Applicant convicted in a State court of\n16\na crime, sentenced to a prison term exceeding one year, and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one\nyear.  10 U.S.C. 986.  Since the statutory provision pertains to granting of security clearances and not to eligibility for\npositions of public trust, the statutory provision is not applicable in this case.  However, the new adjudicative guidelines\ninclude the prohibition as a disqualifying condition.  AG \u00b6 31(f).  The new adjudicative guidelines were made applicable\nto determination of eligibility for public trust positions.  The provision in \u00b6 31(f) was added to the adjudicative guidelines\ninitially promulgated by the President by DoD because of 10 U.S.C. 986 and its applicability to DoD adjudications.\nSince the DoD adjudicative guidelines were never published for review and comment in the Federal Register, it is unclear\nwhether the provisions of \u00b6 31(f) can pertain to eligibility for public trust position determinations..  Since this\ndisqualifying condition is not alleged in the SOR or addressed in the FORM, its applicability to eligibility for public trust\npositions determinations need not be resolved and will not be further discussed in this decision.  \n5\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s convictions for assault, drug use, drug possession with the intent to sell,\npossession of drug paraphernalia, and violation of probation within a ten year period of time raises\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.)   In this case, a series of serious crimes, drug possession with the intent to sell, drug use,\n16\npossession of drug paraphernalia and violations of probation have been established.  The third degree\nassault in 1993 and the speeding offenses by themselves do not amount to serious crimes.  But these\nacts, taken in conjunction with the serious crimes committed by Applicant, establish a pattern that\ncontributes to the raising of security concerns.  \nThe Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) have been considered, and only CC\nMC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and CC MC \u00b6 31(d) (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) have some applicability.  Applicant used marijuana from at least 1998 until\n2002.  He was released form prison in approximately 2004, and stated he has not used drugs since that\ntime.  He presented no evidence of attendance at any counseling or rehabilitation programs.  His drug\nuse was voluntary and not under any unusual circumstances.  Applicant presented no information\nfrom which to conclude that his drug use is unlikely to recur.  There is only limited information on\nrehabilitation.  There is a passage of only about four years since he was incarcerated for drug use.\nRehabilitation information consists of the facts he is now married, has children, and is holding a\nsteady job.  This limited information is offset by his previous voluntary drug use, his other crimes,\nand I violation of probation.  Insufficient times has elapsed since his last criminal act, and there is\nonly limited evidence of successful rehabilitation, to conclude he has been rehabilitated and should\nbe granted eligibility for a position of public trust.  Applicant has not met his burden of establishing\nthat he is rehabilitated and his past criminal actions do not indicate a security concern.  I find against\nApplicant for criminal conduct.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a position of public trust.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties\nfor Applicant.

Tr. 9.\n3\nTr. 34.\n4\nId. at 29.\n5\nId. at 26.\n6\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 2, 2004, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nDecember 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  was provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement, dated December 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 17, 2007. On April 30,\n2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a Notice of Appearance. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May\n1, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 8, 2007.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the\n3\nhearing, the Government offered one exhibit, Ex. 1. Applicant offered 16 exhibits, Exs. A-Q. All\nexhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Prior to the hearing, the Government\nsubmitted nine documents about Russia for administrative notice. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non May 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant was born in Russia. She is 39 years old and works as a test engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  Since 2000, she has worked in the computer field for other contractors. She received her\n4\nbachelor\u2019s degree from a state university in Russia.  In 1992, she immigrated to the U.S. to pursue\n5\na graduate degree in international business. In Russia, she worked as an interpreter and translator for\na small consulting company that had clients in the U.S. The company sponsored her trip to the U.S.\nto continue her graduate education.

Her husband is a U.S. citizen and they married in December 1994 in the U.S.  They met\n7\n8\nin graduate school. In April 2000, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  They adopted their son\n9\nfrom a Russian orphanage in 2002, and he is an American citizen.  Her son is not a dual citizen of\n10\nthe U.S. and Russia. Applicant traveled to Russia in 1993, 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is 62 and a citizen and resident of Russia. She lives in a remote area of\nRussia, where she owns a small flat.  Her mother is a medical doctor and was trained as a\n11\npediatrician. Her mother is the chief of staff or managing doctor at an orphanage, which is run by\nthe local government, receiving subsidies from the federal budget.  Over the years, her mother\n12\nplaced more than 500 children with American families and received a letter from the U.S. Embassy\nlast year \u201cthanking her for helping American families adopt children.\u201d  Her mother makes\n13\napproximately $500 a month and often does not get paid regularly.  Her mother visited the U.S. in\n14\n1999 and Applicant opened a joint bank account with her. Applicant stated this about their joint\naccount: \u201cWhen tough times come, I basically force her to make small withdrawals so she could\nsurvive.\u201d  She talks weekly to her mother by telephone.  \n15\n16\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant sends her family in Russia approximately $200 to $300 about\nsix to eight times per year. She stated that her support to her mother averages about $2,000\nannually.  At times, her mother uses the money to purchase boots, mittens, or coats for the children\n17\nin the orphanage.18\n\nId. at 56.\n19\nId. at 57.\n20\nId. at 58.\n21\nId. at 59.\n22\nId. at 61.\n23\nId.\n24\nId.\n25\nId. at 64.\n26\nId. at 66.\n27\nId. at 80, 78-93.\n28\nId. at 83.\n29\nId.\n30\nId. at 85.\n31\n5\nApplicant\u2019s stepfather is a citizen and resident of Russia. Her stepfather and mother are no\nlonger married.  They divorced when Applicant was in college and the last time she spoke to him\n19\nwas in 1996. She has no idea where he resides.20\nApplicant\u2019s 35-year-old half-brother is a citizen and resident of Russia. He lives in the same\nflat with her mother.  He works in the same orphanage with her mother as a computer technician.\n21\nHe also owns a small business that sells pet food.  She has an estranged relationship with him since\n22\ntheir parents\u2019 divorce.  They rarely communicate by telephone or email. His wife also works at the\n23\norphanage as an accounting assistant.24\nApplicant\u2019s 55- or 56-year-old aunt, her mother\u2019s sister, is a citizen and resident of Russia.25\nShe owns a few retail stores with her husband, selling clothing.  Applicant might speak to her aunt\n26\ntwice a year.27\nThree witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. One witness is a World War II Bronze Star\nrecipient.  He hired Applicant  in about 1997 as an administrative assistant of an investment fund\n28\ngroup where he worked.  He had daily contact with her during her two and one-half years of\n29\nemployment. He intensely scrutinized her background before he hired her as he had about $6 billion\nunder management at the height of his career.  She left because she wanted to move into a more\n30\nprofessional career. After leaving, they continue to see each other socially.  He believes that she is\n31\nloyal to the U.S. and that she should be granted a security clearance. He stated this about her\ncredibility and character:\n\nId. at 86.\n32\nId at 93-101, 102-106.\n33\n6\nYes, I think she certainly was very valuable to us in the firm, and she is an engaging\nyoung woman who had a good personality and gets along well with people, and she\nshowed her discretion during the years that she worked for me.32\nThe other two witnesses met Applicant in late 2004 when she started working at their place\nof employment.  They both believe she is honest, loyal, and trustworthy. They endorse her\n33\napplication for a security clearance.\nApplicant has a strong attachment to the U.S. She owns a home valued at about $300,000.\nShe maintains both checking and savings accounts as well as retirement accounts. She is actively\ninvolved in her community and her son\u2019s activities at school.\nThe U.S. and Russia were former adversaries in the Cold War. While relations between the\ncountries improved after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990, there were issues that remain\ncontentious, including Russia\u2019s support of the Iranian nuclear program. Russia has assisted the U.S.\nin mediating international conflicts and is an ally in the war on terrorism. While its human rights\nrecord has improved since the demise of the Soviet Union, violence and human rights abuses are\nagain on the rise. Russia has an active, recent, and ongoing program targeting the U.S. As of 2005,\nRussia was the most aggressive collector of and accounted for the majority of the targeting of\nsensitive and protected U.S. technology. The U.S. State Department cautions Americans traveling\nto Russia that there remains a heightened potential for terrorist attacks, although Americans are not\nbeing specifically targeted.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n34\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n35\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n36\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n37\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n38\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n39\nId.\n40\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n41\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n42\n6\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n34\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n35\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n36\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.37\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.38\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n39\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n40\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n41\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n42\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline \u00b6 6 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding foreign influence. \u201cForeign\ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\ninterest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country\nin which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s mother, half-brother, stepfather, and aunt are residents and citizens of Russia. She\nhas visited her family in Russia at least five times between 1993 and 2002. Applicant has frequent\ncontact and a close relationship with her mother. The relationship with her mother creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because her mother is a resident and citizen of Russia\nand Russia actively seeks intelligence, classified, and economic information from U.S. businesses. Her\nclose connection to her mother also creates a potential conflict of interest because this relationship is\nsufficiently close to raise a security concern about her desire to help her mother by providing sensitive\nor classified information. Her relationship with her mother is sufficiently substantial to potentially\nsubject her to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  Consequently, Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Conditions \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\nand \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information)\napply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The most important\nmitigating factor is Applicant herself and her total commitment to the U.S. through her employment\nwith major defense contractors for the past seven years. She married an American and they have a\nhome in the U.S. Moreover, she has not sought dual citizenship for her son in Russia. Although her\nmother and half-brother work for a state-run orphanage, they are in a remote town in Russia and\nneither one has any affiliation with the Russian government. None of her relatives living in Russia\npose a potential security threat or are in a position likely to be influenced by the Russian government.\nNone of them work for the Russian government or are involved in work that might create security\nissues for the U.S. Russia is a country where there is a heightened risk because of their active\nintelligence gathering activities aimed at the U.S. Thus, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition \u00b6 8(a)\n(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located,\nor the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) applies. \nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. She has lived\nin the U.S. since 1992. Her husband is a U.S. citizen and her son was born in the U.S. Because of\nApplicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., she can be expected to\nresolve any conflict  in favor of the U.S. Thus, \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest)\napplies. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.f of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Looking at the whole person, Applicant presents a highly credible case that she would not be\ninfluenced by anything contrary to the best interests of the U.S. Her residence in the U.S. for more than\n15 years, her marriage to an American, and her career record with several major defense contractors\n\n8\nfor more than seven years effectively refute the risk that she would now take any action that would\njeopardize U.S. security interests. She has assimilated into U.S. customs and culture and continues to\nembrace the U.S. as her home. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the potential security concerns\narising from her personal ties to Russia. I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant a clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

The court withheld adjudication and sentenced Applicant\nas a first offender to three years of probation. As a result of the underlying conduct\u2014having sexual\nintercourse and providing alcohol to a 14-year-old female client\u2014Applicant was dismissed or\nterminated from his job as a state detention care worker. About 15 years later in 2000, he was caught\nshoplifting. He pleaded no contest and was fined. He gave false testimony about his 1985 criminal\nconduct during the security-clearance hearing. He has made multiple false statements about his\nbackground and conduct. Clearance is denied.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nFebruary 2, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct and\nGuideline E for personal conduct.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn March 12, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 30, 2007, and the transcript was received on September 12, 2007.   \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding to subparagraph 1.c under\nGuideline J (alleging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\u2013making a false statement within the\njurisdiction of a federal agency) and by adding three falsifications allegations (subparagraphs 2.e,\n2.f, and 2.g) under Guideline E (Appellate Exhibit I). The motion was supported by the record\nevidence, Applicant had no objections, and the motion to amend was granted (R. 17\u201323, 42\u201343). \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges Applicant pleaded no contest to criminal offenses in\n1985 and 2000. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant was dismissed from his job in 1985\ndue to the underlying criminal conduct. Also, the SOR alleges Applicant made false statements\nduring interviews and when completing two security-clearance applications. Applicant does not\ndispute the criminal proceedings or the dismissal, but he denies making deliberately false statements.\nIn addition, the following facts are established.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior mail clerk who has worked for the same company or its\nsubcontractor since 1986. His work involves handling the company\u2019s mail, which from time to time\ncontains classified information. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him\nby the Defense Department. \nApplicant has never married. He is a high-school graduate and he has taken some college\ncourses. He has a 14-year-old daughter whom he obtained custody of from the mother. The daughter\nlives with Applicant. In addition to his regular job, Applicant has worked as a high-school sports\nofficial for many years. \nIn 1985, Applicant pleaded no contest to the felony offense of lewd and lascivious act in the\npresence of a child under the age of 16 (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9). The court withheld adjudication\nand sentenced Applicant as a first offender to three years of probation. The probation was supervised,\nand he completed it without a violation.\nApplicant met the girl through his state public employment as a detention care worker at a\njuvenile detention center. As a result of the underlying conduct\u2014having sexual intercourse and\nproviding alcohol to a 14-year-old female client\u2014Applicant was dismissed or terminated from his\njob as a state detention care worker (Exhibit 7). \nDuring the criminal case in 1985, he initially denied having sexual intercourse with the girl.\nIn time, he admitted having sexual intercourse with the girl at his home in February 1985, but he\ndenied having intercourse with her at his home in May 1985 as she reported (Exhibits 4 and 5).\nDuring a Defense Department background investigation in 1986, he admitted having sexual\nintercourse with the girl at his home in February 1985 (Exhibit 13). He denied having sexual\nintercourse with her in May 1985.  \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant denied having sexual intercourse with the girl at any time\n(R. 61). He did not have a reasonable explanation for his change of story (See R. 62\u201372, 85). His\ndenial was not credible.\nIn 1986, Applicant completed a security-clearance application for the Defense Department\n(Exhibit 2). In response to Question 14 about arrests, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d and described his\n1985 arrest for lewd and lascivious act with a child resulting in three years of probation. In response\nto Question 15a about ever using any illegal drug, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d when he knew he had\ntried marijuana in 1979 (Exhibit 12). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

He\npleaded no contest and was fined $155.  \nIn 2004, Applicant completed another security-clearance application for the Defense\nDepartment (Exhibit 1). In response to Question 21 about ever having been charged with or\nconvicted of any felony offense, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d He should have reported his 1985\ncriminal offense. In response to Question 26 about other offenses (not listed elsewhere) in the last\nseven years for which he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of, Applicant answered\n\u201cno.\u201d He should have reported his 2000 shoplifting offense. In response to Question 27 about illegal\ndrug use, he reported a one-time use of marijuana in 1979. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n15\n5\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and credible adverse\n14\ninformation that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. In particular, a\nsecurity concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d15\nSOR subparagraph 2.a concerns Applicant\u2019s 1985 dismissal from his state public\nemployment due to his criminal misconduct with the girl. This matter does not fall within a\ndisqualifying condition under Guideline E. On this basis, a favorable finding will be made on this\nsubparagraph. But this matter is considered under Guideline J as a consequence of his 1985 criminal\nconduct. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made six false statements (one to the police department in\n1985 and five to the Defense Department in 1986, 2004, and 2005). Applicant contends his\nstatements were not deliberately false. Given the record evidence, the multiple allegations will be\ntreated collectively instead of analyzing each falsification allegation individually. \nThe doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus (false in one thing, false in everything)\nshould be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility. In his hearing testimony, Applicant lied\nwhen he contradicted prior statements wherein he admitted having sexual intercourse with the girl\nin February 1985. Because his testimony on this key fact is not credible, his attempts to refute and\n\n DC 1 is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n16\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\n DC 2 is \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\n17\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n18\n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n19\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n20\n DC 3 is \u201callegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n21\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n6\nrebut the six falsification allegations are likewise not credible. In short, Applicant\u2019s testimony on\nthese points has no credibility whatsoever. On this basis, the record evidence is sufficient to prove\nApplicant made deliberately false statements as alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, the record\nevidence is sufficient to conclude that both DC 1  and DC 2  apply against Applicant. \n16\n17\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. His deliberately false hearing testimony precludes any credit in extenuation or\nmitigation.\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the security concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n18\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d19\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of criminal conduct\nstemming from his felony offense in 1985 and his misdemeanor offense in 2000. In addition,\nApplicant committed criminal conduct when he made deliberately false statements to the Defense\nDepartment in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which is a federal criminal statute. Given these\ncircumstances, both DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant.  \n20\n21\nAll of the MCs under the guideline have been considered and none apply. His deliberately\nfalse hearing testimony militates against a conclusion of reform and rehabilitation. \nTo conclude, Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence (See Exhibits A, B, and C) is not sufficient to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the cumulative effect of his criminal conduct and false\nstatements. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that\nanalysis does not support a favorable decision for Applicant.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs b\u2013g:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

By explaining the facts regarding his plea and the sequence of\nevents surrounding his security clearance applications, Applicant has mitigated criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 19, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On December 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. It also recommended the matter be referred to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether his clearance should be revoked. \nIn a letter, dated January 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR.  He admitted the\n1\nallegations raised under Guideline J, denied the sole allegation raised under Guideline E, and elected\nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel prepared the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on April 24, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material\n(FORM)  was received by Applicant and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and\n2\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30-days of his receipt of the FORM.\nApplicant submitted additional information, dated May 28, 2007, that was accepted as part of the\nFORM without objection by Department Counsel.

The single exception to this requirement is for certain\nconvictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement\norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d Applicant did not list the 2002\nincident because his non-drug-related plea had been expunged upon payment of the $100 fine,\ntherefore he assumed it the expungement order fell under an exception to the reporting requirement.\nOn October 8, 2005, Applicant and his wife had an argument or domestic dispute. Applicant\nwas charged with 1) simple assault/battery and 2) refusal/relinquish of phones.  Both charges were\n7\ndropped.  These charges are included in national files maintained by the Federal Bureau of\n8\nInvestigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division.  Those same files note that \u201can\n9\n\n Id. at 2.\n10\n Response to the SOR, supra, note 3.\n11\n FORM at 2.\n12\n4\nindividual should be presumed not guilty of any charge/arrest for which there is no final disposition\nstated on the record or otherwise determined.\u201d10\nIn January 2006, Applicant\u2019s SF-86 was returned to him. He was specifically directed to\nprovide additional information regarding his work history. He did so, then initialed and signed the\napplication again. It did not occur to him to review or up-date other sections of the application\npackage. Had he known of such a requirement, he would have provided information regarding the\n dropped 2005 domestic charges.  The omission was not a deliberate act on his behalf, only a\n11\nmisunderstanding as to the instructions. In a subsequent interview with investigators, he fully\ndisclosed the incident.\nIn its FORM, the Government introduces Applicant\u2019s SF-86 as Item 4. The first page is\nelectronically stamped as having been signed on May 19, 2005. The first page starts with the first\nquestion, then the next three pages continue through question 30. Page 5 begins with a repeat of\nquestion of 30, continues to the final question (question 43), and is signed at the bottom with the date\nof January 30, 2006. The following page, signed and dated May 19, 2005, includes questions 10\nthrough 16 and 43 and answers consistent with the previously stated questions 10 through 16 and\n43. Another four pages follow which consist of usual addenda and releases. No explanation is given\nas to why the SF-86 is thus comprised. Department Counsel depicts the Item as \u201cSecurity clearance\napplication (SF86), dated May 19, 2005, and signed both May 19, 2005, and January 30, 2006 (10\npages).\u201d12\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App Bd Jul. 11, 1997).\n13\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App Bd Dec 31, 1997), Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\n Department of the Navy v.

The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n16\ndecision.17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n20\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n21\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following two adjudicative guidelines\nmost pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about\na person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor,  dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n Because the Government failed to provide any documentary evidence substantiating this charge and plea, and\n22\nbecause Applicant limited his commentary to the disposition of the matter, little more can be said about the incident.\n6\nConditions pertaining to these recently amended adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set\nforth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts,\nfactors, and conditions, I find the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nCriminal Conduct:\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established its case.\nApplicant admits that he was arrested for incidents occurring in 2002 and 2005, and that he pled\nguilty to the 2002 charge. Such incidents and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns,\ninvoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1, \u00b634(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, \u00b634(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted), and\ninitiate inquiry.\nAt issue are two criminal incidents. First, Applicant pled guilty to possession of a fake ID at\nage 22. The incident occurred nearly five years ago, shortly after reaching his majority. He is now 27\nyears of age. In the intervening years, he has married, matured, and joined the work force. There have\nbeen no other similar or related incidents in the intervening years, and there is little reason to believe\nit should happen again. \nDepartment Counsel argues that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the arrest\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that the behavior is unlikely to recur, and she notes that\nthe Applicant had reached his majority at the time. The fact that a 22-year-old would be in actual need\nor possession of a fake ID, however, is, in itself, unusual. Applicant is relatively slight in physical size\nand was then barely over 21-years of age, a combination that may well given rise to the ill-advised,\nbut not uncommon, practice of carrying a fake ID. In the absence of some additional facts linking this\ninfraction to some adult criminal activity raising heightened concerns, such as driving without a\nlicense or resisting arrest, there is nothing to suggest that the more mature Applicant of today would\never again find himself in this position.  Consequently, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC\n22\nMC) 1, \u00b632(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nThe SOR also cites to a 2005 allegation regarding a domestic dispute. Here, the police\nintervened and, erring on the side of caution, charged Applicant on two counts. Those charges were\nquickly dropped. Although allegations concerning a domestic disturbance can help raise a\ndisqualifying condition and invoke inquiry, they do not establish that any \u201ccriminal behavior\nhappened,\u201d that the person was coerced into \u201ccommitting the act\u201d or offense alleged, or that any\n\n Also, as noted in item 5, \u201can individual should be presumed not guilty of any charge/arrest for which there\n23\nisno final disposition stated on the record or otherwise determined.\u201d \n Compare Item 5, supra, note 4. \n24\n The other incident cited in the SOR occurred in October 2005.\n25\n7\ncriminal activity occurred as a fait accompli.  Moreover, while such allegations may raise an\n23\ninference of criminal activity, it is not the sort of activity, if proven, that would construct a nexus with\na conviction for possessing a fake ID. While the burden rests on the Applicant  to demonstrate\nevidence sufficient to overcome the Government\u2019s proffer regarding this incident, presented as it is\nwith no elaboration of the facts, no police report, and no explanation as to what exactly one of the\ncharges means, the fact that the charges were dropped is highly mitigative in itself.  \nPersonal Conduct\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts regarding his criminal\nrecord on his SF-86. Specifically, the Government points to Applicant\u2019s negative answer to Question\n26 despite his 2002 and 2005 arrests and his 2002 guilty plea. Consequently, Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC), \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)\napplies.\nIn 2002, when Applicant pled guilty to possessing a fake ID, the judge told him that the matter\nwould be expunged from his record upon payment of the fine. Applicant paid the fine and the matter\nceased to be on his record.  When Applicant completed his in May 2005 SF-86, that matter had been\n24\nexpunged.  Question 26 stressed the need to report any offense not previously covered on the form,\n25\nincluding those which had been sealed or stricken from the record. Not seeing the word \u201cexpunged\u201d\namong those descriptors, he assumed the expunged, minor, 2002 incident was not to be reported.\nWhen reading the final sentence - \u201cThe single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions\nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act . . .for which the court issued an expungement . . . \u201d -\nhe assumed the question meant to exclude any expungement except those related to the Federal\nControlled Substances Act. Given the cumbersome wording of the question and Appellant\u2019s limited\neducation and youth, his explanation is not implausible. Importantly, in the absence of some evidence\nor suggestion he acted with deliberate falsity, none of the available Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (PC DC) apply to this omission. \nWhen, in January 2006, Applicant was asked to up-date his work history portion of his SF-86,\nhe did as directed. He did not up-date any other questions or otherwise review the SF-86 in its entirety\nbecause he was not told to do so. In the absence of some indication he meant to mislead, conceal, or\nfalsify his answers, a negative answer to question 26 does not automatically raise a PC DC. Indeed,\nbased on the evidence, it is hard to tell whether Applicant even had the opportunity to up-date\nquestion 26 had he though to do so. The SF-86 curiously contains only one sheet of questions with\na January 2006 date; the remainder are either dated May 19, 2005, or blend compatibly with them.\nMoreover, the January 2006 page is limited in scope to posing questions 30 through 46 and does not\ninclude any inquiry regarding question 26. It is thus impossible to tell whether Applicant had the\n\n In finding that no disqualifying condition is raised under Guideline E, paragraph c under Guideline J is found\n26\nin favor of Applicant.\n8\nopportunity to change or up-date question 26 on his own initiative. Again, with no indication\nApplicant deliberately tried to omit, conceal, or falsify, no PC DC can be raised.  \n26\nI have considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept. Applicant is a maturing young man who admitted the allegations concerning his arrests and\nguilty plea and denied, with a reasonable explanation, an allegation he falsified his SF-86. Although\nhis guilty plea was the result of an adult\u2019s actions, it occurred shortly after he reached his majority and\nconcerned a minor offense from about five years ago. No elaboration was given with regard to charges\nrelated to a domestic incident between Applicant and his wife, so the only fact related to that alleged\nincident is that the charges were dropped. The former incident was expunged, and Applicant was told\nit would be removed from his record. The latter occurred after Applicant drafted his SF-86 and the\nFORM fails to provide evidence Applicant had the opportunity to change his answer to question 26\nhad he wished to do so. \nBased on these facts, security concerns were understandably raised. With concise narrative\nby Applicant and a review of the FORM, those security concerns have been mitigated. In the absence\nof lingering security concerns, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security\nclearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.2.5 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

These Financial Considerations are still of security significance; and\nas such, mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance in denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 22, 2007.\nThe case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on February 27, 2007, for a March 22, 2007 hearing.  The case was reassigned to the\nundersigned on March 6, 2007; and pursuant a request from the Applicant, was continued until April\n16, 2007, when it was heard.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was\ntaken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was\nreceived on April 26, 2007.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's current Financial\nConsiderations militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the\nunderlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 36 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n1.a.  In 2000, the Applicant had in excess of $40,000 of debts discharged by way of a Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy (TR at page 27 line 14 to page 34 line 5).  This bankruptcy was caused, for the most\npart, by unexpected medical bills due to the birth of two premature children.  Since then, however,\nhe has incurred over $19,000 in past due debts (Government Exhibit (GX) 5).  He avers that, with\nthe aid of his financial advisor fiancee, he will try to address these debts, but has only budgeted $200\neach month to this end (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A at enclosures 2, 3 and 5).\n1.b. and 1.l.  The Applicant owes a credit card company about $1,189 in past due\nindebtedness (GX 5 at page 1).  He has done little to address this debt (TR at page 38 line 25 to page\n42 line 7, and at page 65 line 20 to page 66 line 18).\n1.c.  The Applicant owes a finance company about $8,593 in past due indebtedness, for an\nautomobile that was repossessed (TR at page 42 lines 8~20).  He has done little to address this debt\n(Id).\n\n4\n1.d.  The Applicant testified credibly that he has paid a $194 telephone bill (TR at page 42\nlines 8~20).  This debt does not appear on the Applicant\u2019s most recent February 2007 credit report.\n1.e.  The Applicant has paid a $55 telephone bill to another phone provider (TR at page 43\nline13 to page 44 line 24).  The Applicant is current with this phone provider (AppX A at enclosures\n13 and 15).\n1.f.  The Applicant owes another credit card company about $140 in past due indebtedness\n(GX 5 at page 2).  He has done little to address this debt (TR at page 48 line 24 to page 49 line 20).\n1.g.  The Applicant owes a sixth creditor about $262 in past due indebtedness (GX 5 at page\n2).  He pleads ignorance as to this debt (TR at page 53 lines 1~11).\n1.h.  The Applicant owes a credit union about $1,001 in past due indebtedness (GX 5 at page\n2).  He has done little to address this debt (TR at page 53 line 12 to page 54 line 3).\n1.i.  The Applicant owes a third credit card company about $3,539 in past due indebtedness.\nHe has done little to address this debt (TR at page 54 line 4 to page 57 line 20).\n1.j. and 1.k.  The Applicant owes a bank about $4,402 in past due indebtedness on two\nseparate accounts (GX 5 at page 2).  He has done little to address these debts (TR at page 57 line 21\nto page 59 line 15).\nMitigation\nThe Applicant and his fiancee aver that he hopes to address his debts in the future, and is\ncurrently living within his means (AppX A at enclosures 2 and 3).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must be given binding\nconsideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in\nevery case according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically\ndeterminative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance\non his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case. \nAs set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common\nsense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\n\n5\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security\nclearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant has in excess of $19,000 in past due indebtedness, dating back to his 2000\nbankruptcy.  The first and third disqualifying conditions are therefore applicable in this case, as there\nis a \u201chistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts.\u201d  I can find no countervailing mitigating conditions, as the Applicant has done little to address\nthe vast majority of his past due debts.  He and his fiancee aver to his future intentions, but this is\ntoo little too late.  Guideline F is therefore found against the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding\nhis Financial Considerations.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nF, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion under Guideline F.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\na.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 38-year-old facility security officer for a defense contractor, failed to mitigate\nfinancial security concerns relating to delinquent debts of almost $90,000 even though he filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2007 and hopes to be able to discharge the debts. He has made only\none payment. He was in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996, and incurred additional debts that became\ndelinquent during a seven year period after the bankruptcy was discharged. He did not resolve any\nof the smaller delinquent debts incurred except for regular payments on delinquent federal taxes for\ntwo tax years. His debts include repossessions for two automobiles purchased since the first\nbankruptcy was discharged. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn April 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn April 24, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 6, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June 7, 2007, for a\nhearing on June 26, 2007, and held that day. The government offered in evidence 11 exhibits and\nApplicant offered six. All were admitted. The transcript was received on July 6, 2007. The record\nwas left open for an interim report on July 24, 2007 and final submission on August 24, 2007, of\nadditional materials. The interim documents and a final submission were received. All were admitted\nwithout objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the specifics of all of the SOR allegations relating to a bankruptcy in\n1996, and 19 delinquent debts of almost $90,000. After a complete review of the record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a major defense contractor where he has been\nemployed since April 2000 as a facility security manager. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in business\nadministration. He has held a security clearance since 1988 with no security violations. Between\n1988 and now he served in the Marine Corps for six years with a rank of E 5, worked for a\ngovernment agency as an analyst, and for another government contractor. \nIn 1996 Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy which was discharged in 1997. The primary\ncause for the bankruptcy arose when he was  divorced in 1994 which resulted in his sole ownership\nof a home for which he could not make payments. However, the bankruptcy included not only the\n\n3\nhome mortgage of $101, 000 but also over $20,000 in consumer and credit card debt (Exh. 10). After\nthe bankruptcy, Applicant bought a new car on which he could not make payments, and it is the\nsubject of one of the auto repossessions in this proceeding (SOR \u00b6 1. m.)\nApplicant\u2019s present financial problems accelerated after a second marriage in 1999 when he\nacquired three step children. One of the children has severe health problems and a second was\nsexually assaulted twice with resulting emotional problems. Because of the problems relating to the\nchildren and custody issues arising with his wife and her ex-husband over the step-children, the\nfamily moved their residence nine times since 2000. He and his wife now have one child from their\nmarriage. Although these problems have occurred, there is little evidence of the nexus between them\nand the financial difficulties of Applicant. The reason Applicant may not have known about some\nof the smaller delinquent debts is because of the large number of moves of his residence over a seven\nyear period since any efforts to reach him would have followed a long trail of addresses. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $64,000. In addition he has a second job for a delivery service\nat a salary of $10,000 per annum. Through this job he receives free health care insurance for his\nfamily (Tr. 44). The second job is from 4 A.M. until 8 A.M. when he reports to his full time job. He\ncommutes 90 miles each way to his work from their rented home which is located near his wife\u2019s\nfamily. In 2006 he fell asleep at the wheel driving to work, had an accident, and destroyed the car.\nHis wife has received training as a legal assistant and is employed earning $2,000 per month. \nThe 19 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR range from several debts to utilities and service\nproviders of under $200 and for two auto repossessions for over $19,000 each (SOR \u00b6 1.i. and\nm.).The first was the auto he bought after the first bankruptcy; the second was a voluntary\nrepossession of a new minivan he bought in 2005. He now owns two autos on which he is making\nregular payments. He has two student loans for over $25,000 that have been in default since 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d. and q.). They were originally for under $20,000 but delinquency fees have increased the\ndebts. These debts were carried over after the first bankruptcy where they were listed but could not\nbe discharged. The only delinquent debts that are being satisfied through regular monthly payments\nof $75 (Tr. 53) are to pay delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2004 and 2005 totaling $2,500 (SOR\n\u00b6 1. r. and s.). He has been in negotiation with several of the creditors (SOR \u00b6 1.c., f, k, l., and p.),\nbut no settlements with them were reached (Exh. 4). Applicant acknowledges other debts in his\ncandid interrogatory answers, but indicates no efforts to resolve them except to note the large number\nof his household moves (Exh. 4). \nApplicant tried to avoid a second bankruptcy by taking the second job. However, he  recently\nengaged counsel and filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2007 (Exh. I 3). He began\npayments under the plan in August 2007. The plan requires payments of $850 per month over the\nnext five years depending on the number and amounts of the debts that are actually included in the\nbankruptcy and the possibility of settling some for lesser amounts (Tr. 62). After the bankruptcy is\ndischarged, he will be required to begin payment on his education loans. He now does not have\nenough left over to pay $850 per month (Tr. 65) but is decreasing his family expenses to improve\nhis ability to make the payments (Tr. 66). \nApplicant acknowledges that he has done more in the past six months to resolve his financial\nproblems than in the last six or seven years. He has no excuses for his failure to pay some of the\nsmaller debts (Tr. 51) particularly in view of his work responsibilities as a facility security officer\n\n4\nwhere he counsels other people on security issues (Tr. 9). He has received training through his\nemployment as a certified facility security officer.\nApplicant now has two credit cards on which he makes regular payments. He recently\nreturned to the mortgagee a home he owned for which he could not make mortgage payments. This\nwas done as a deed in lieu of foreclosure (Exh. H). He believes there will be no additional charges\npassed on to him as a result of the transaction. He and his wife now own two cars with total\npayments of over $700 per month on which he is current and regular. \nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor for his honesty and hard work. He is a well-\nmotivated, competent performer who is working two jobs to support his family and hopefully get out\nof debt. (Exh. F). \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline\n\n5\nF of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) since an individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) Conditions that could raise\na security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations\n(AG \u00b6 19 c.), and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (AG \u00b6 19 a) Mitigating\nConditions (MC) include a condition that the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 d), the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the person acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances (AG \u00b6 20 b) , and there is clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control (AG \u00b6 20 c).  \nAfter Applicant had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 1997, he had many family\nproblems that were beyond his control. However, he offered little evidence to establish a nexus\nbetween the family problems and the severe financial difficulties he now has. Even if there was a\nfirmly established nexus, the fact that he has done so little to settle or pay even the smallest accounts\nover the past seven years does not establish responsible behavior by Applicant. While the many\nhousehold moves may well have made it difficult for creditors to reach him, it is no excuse for not\nmaking better efforts to resolve debts that he should have known to exist. This is particularly so in\nview of the position he has held as a security officer responsible for enforcing the security\nrequirements on others. \nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy has just been initiated although Applicant has considered doing\nso at least since 2006. Thus, there is no payment record for the bankruptcy or even a definitive listing\nof the amounts likely to be resolved by the bankruptcy. There is also some doubt concerning his\nability to make the payments as he hopes to do in view of the need to cut his expenses to have\nenough at the end of the month to make the payments to the bankruptcy trustee. Thus, I conclude that\nit is premature to conclude that mitigating conditions apply to him. \nApplicant is a very hard-working person to hold two jobs with extreme hours of work to care\nfor his family. He was very candid in his answers to interrogatories and in his testimony. However,\nApplicant has made many choices over the past seven years as to how to spend his money and where\nhe lived. Those were his choices to make.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. While\nApplicant is a person of considerable energy and ability, I cannot conclude that the conditions\nrequired for application of the whole person standard have been satisfied in view of his lack of\nresponsible behavior over such a long period of time. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that it is premature to grant a\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par.

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 30, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)and  Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines\n(Guidelines on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending\nofficial amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when\nthe SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1,\n2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on April 16, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on April 26, 2007.  I convened a hearing on June 5, 2007, to consider whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nThe government moved to amend the SOR per its motion filed on April 13, 2007, adding a\nsubparagraph 3.  The Applicant answered the amended SOR on May 22, 2007.  I sustained the\nmotion and the SOR was amended to include allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nthe Directive.  The government offered two exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-2.  I took administrative\nnotice of five administrative exhibits, marked 1-5.  Applicant offered no exhibits.  All exhibits were\nadmitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1. and 2.  He denied the\nallegations in subparagraph 3.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,\nI make the following additional findings of fact: \n\nTr. at 10-11.\n2\nId. at 11.\n3\nSOR.\n4\nTr. at 25-27.\n5\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 18-23.\n6\n3\nApplicant is a 25-year-old database administrator employed by a federal contractor.   He was\n2\nmarried in 2005, and has no children.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science.   He has no\nprior military service.  This is his first application for a security clearances.   \n3\nApplicant was born in the United States in 1981, and a year later, his family moved to\nNigeria.  He returned to the United States in 1995, for his high school and college education.  On\nDecember 3, 2004, even though he was a citizen of the United States, he applied for and was issued\na Nigerian passport, because it was cheaper to travel to Nigeria if he used a Nigerian passport.  When\nhe was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), in March 2006, he still\npossessed the Nigerian passport set to expire December 2, 2009.  In December 2004, he used his\nNigerian passport to travel to attend his brother\u2019s wedding.4\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Nigeria currently residing in the United States as a registered\nalien.  He and his wife were married in October 2005, but kept their marriage secret from both\nfamilies until after March of 2006.  His parents did not want him to marry, thinking that his wife\nmight be trying to gain U.S. citizenship by marrying Applicant.  At the time, her parents did not\nknow Applicant and his family and did not like Applicant.  All has been forgiven.  He is sponsoring\nhis wife to stay in the United States when she graduates from college.   \n5\nWhile living in Nigeria, his mother owned a shop and his father worked as a manager for an\ninsurance company.  All of his brothers and sisters were born in the United States.  When his parents\nmoved back to United States in the 1990s, his mother became a U.S. citizen.  His father is not.  He\nis here on a permanent residence visa.  While living in Nigeria, Applicant returned once to visit the\nU.S.  He came with his mother on a vacation trip.  All of his brothers and sisters live in the United\nStates.  His wife\u2019s parents and brother live in Nigeria.  Her younger brother recently came here to\nattend college.  His father-in-law works for the Nigerian government in the customs office.  His wife\nspeaks to her parents two or three times a month.  She also exchanges e-mails with them.\nApplicant made an incomplete answer on a questionnaire for national security positions,\nexecuted by him on October 17, 2005, in response to \u201cSection 15.  Citizenship of Your Relatives\nand Associates.\u201d  He failed to disclose a close and continuing relationship with a Nigerian citizen,\nwhom he married on October 27, 2005.

Since gaining independence from Britain in 1960,\n10\nNigeria has experienced periods of political instability and turmoil, as well as economic crisis.11\nNigerian political life has been scarred by conflict along both ethnic and geographic lines and\ndominated by military coups and long military-imposed transition programs rather than civilian\nrule.   The military has ruled Nigeria for approximately 28 of its 43 years since independence.  In\n12\nMay 1999, Nigeria return to civilian rule.13\nThe Nigerian Government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the government continues to\ncommit serious human rights abuses.   Government officials at all levels have committed serious\n14\nabuses.   Areas of Nigeria are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflicts\n15\nbetween religious, political, and ethnic factions.   Ongoing  Religious and ethnic conflicts exist in\n16\nNigeria between Muslim and Christian groups and between other ethnic groups.   The lack of law\n17\nand order in Nigeria poses considerable risk to travelers, including the risk of becoming victims of\narmed robbery or kidnaping.

The U.S. State Department has\n19\nwarned of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and a further deterioration of the security situation in the\nNiger Delta region.   Kidnaping for ransom of persons associated with petroleum section, including\n20\nUS citizens, remains common and denied your Niger Delta area.   The Al Qaeda leadership has\n21\nexpressed an interest in overthrowing the government of Nigeria.22\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n23\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s]\n24\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether\nApplicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006).\n6\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n23\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nGuidelines \u00b6 6. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism.\n\n7\nGuidelines \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\nGuidelines \u00b6 8. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country,\nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n2001).  Applicant has no frequent contacts or a close relationship with anyone living in Nigeria.  His\nwife, however, does.  Her parents could create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted\nexploitation from Nigerian agents  or terrorists.  He has very little contact with them, and her brother\nis now in the U.S. going to college.  These are minimal connections that tend to eliminates the\npotential conflict of interest because there is no relationship sufficiently close to raise a security\nconcern.\nAs previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment.  Nigeria has generally had good relations with the U.S. and is ruled by a military-\nbacked civilian government with a poor record of human rights.  With this history it is still not easy\nto find in Applicant\u2019s favor.  His wife\u2019s parents may be at risk, although the fact that her father works\nfor the Nigerian government could lessen the risk substantially.  Accordingly, Applicant is unable\nto successfully mitigate the security concern using the Guidelines \u00b6 8 (a) standard.\nUnder the mitigating condition of Guidelines \u00b6 8 (b) there is a no conflict of interest because\nApplicant has no deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties to any family in Nigeria.  His\nwife speaks to her parents frequently, two or three times a month.  His wife has substantial contact\nwith her immediate family members in Nigeria.  They both traveled to Nigeria for his brothers\nwedding.  His wife is planning a trip to Nigeria in December 2007.  All of these factors raise a\nconcern of compromising his ability to keep classified information confidential.  \n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3\n25\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\nGuidelines \u00b6 2.\n26\nISCR Case No. 03-21423 at 7-10.\n27\n8\nAppellant, however, did establish the mitigating conditions of Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) or 8(c) as\nnone of his family live in Nigeria.  He established that \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of [his in-laws] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  His lack of\ncontacts with them will not force him to choose between the United States and Nigeria.  He met his\nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with Nigerian citizens] could create\na risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship and loyalty\nto the U.S., and he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nHe has lived in the United States since 1995.  He became a U.S. citizen at birth.  His parents live in\nthe U.S. and his mother is a U.S. citizen.  He received his college education in U.S. colleges and\nuniversities.  He stated his intent to renounce his Nigerian citizenship, and cut his passport into two\npieces.  Therefore, this mitigating condition is applicable. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or his relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  Guidelines \u00b6 2 specifically\nrequire each administrative judge to consider all the facts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual case.  To ignore such evidence would establish\na virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any person with ties to persons in a foreign\ncountry, which is contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.  \u201cAlthough the position of an\napplicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the favorable application of\n[former guidelines] Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an\napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still\nwarrant a favorable application of the relevant general factors.\u201d25\nOne of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   In that regard, an important factor for consideration is the\n26\ncharacter of any foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the\ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  The relationship between a foreign government\nand the U.S. is relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely\nto attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to against the United States through the applicant.  The\nnature of the foreign government might also relate to the question of whether the foreign government\nor an entity it controls would risk jeopardizing its relationship with the United States by exploiting\nor threatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray this country.  A hostile\nrelationship may make it more likely that Nigeria would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through his\nrelatives or associates.27\nEven though Nigeria has a civilian government at present, there has been a history of military\ncoups and military governments.  If Nigeria would attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s relatives to obtain\n\nSee ISCR Case No.  04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd.  March 5, 2007).\n28\nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\n29\n9\nclassified information, I believe Applicant would properly notify the U.S. authorities.  The potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, is still a prime concern.  However, other matters, such\nas evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties\nto the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S., and many\nothers raised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation of an\napplicant\u2019s worthiness of a security clearance.   \n28\nApplicant has no immediate family in Nigeria, but his wife\u2019s parents live there.  The Appeal\nBoard suggests that the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties;\nthe nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign\ncountry; his or his ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given\ncase.\u201d   In the present case, there is a fair amount of information about positive attributes to\n29\nApplicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that could weigh in favor of granting him a security clearance, in\nresponse to the disqualification under Guideline B.  I considered his age (25), his education which\nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree, his employment record, his reasons for travel to Nigeria, and his\nfinancial stability make him a better candidate for a security clearance than he would be without\nthese positive attributes.  And, his lack of close contacts with his extended family members who live\nin Nigeria and are subject to the potential terrorist activity and government pressure does not\noutweigh his positive attributes. \nTo conclude, Applicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, the\nwhole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in\nthe Directive.  I conclude that he has mitigated the Guideline B concerns, and it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nGuidelines \u00b6 9. The Concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuidelines \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\nGuidelines \u00b6 11. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n\n10\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n. \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated.\nThe government established its case under Guidelines \u00b6 10 (a) (2), because Applicant held\na valid Nigerian passport, had exercised dual citizenship by using the passport to travel to Nigeria\nin 2004, was refusing to surrender it at the time the SOR was issued.  At the hearing, after learning\nthat keeping his Nigerian passport would make a security clearance problematic, he then expressed\na willingness to and did renounce his Nigerian citizenship and cut his Nigerian passport into two\npieces.  \nThe mitigating conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 11 (a) (b) and (e) are applicable to successfully\nmitigate the security concerns.  Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on his parents citizenship and\nhis birth in Nigeria.  I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative.\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant did not list all of his relatives and associates, even though there is a list of 19\ncategories on page 18 of the questionnaire for national security positions.  The omitted person was\nhis fiancee\u2019.  They were about to get married, but both sets of parents were opposed.  They decided\nto go ahead and get married but not tell their parents.  Applicant was afraid to disclose the\nrelationship for fear the \u201cplot\u201d would be discovered.  In stating he had been to Nigeria only once, his\nconfusion is understandable, as he did travel to Nigeria once after returning to the U.S. in 1995, with\nhis mother for a vacation.  Applicant had no background in national security clearances and it can\n\n11\nbe confusing when dealing with a strange, new subject.  I find that his errors were negligent but not\ndone with the intent to deliberately mislead the government.  Mitigating condition (PC MC)\nGuidelines \u00b6 17 (c) applies in that two years have passed, it is infrequent behavior on Applicant\u2019s\npart,  is not likely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his overall trustworthiness or reliability.  I\nconclude Guideline E for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted all six of the SOR allegations relating to delinquent debts with explanation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a major defense contractor since August 2005 working as a security guard. He has delinquent debts of almost $14,000 and a salary of approximately $20,000 per annum. He has not been a good financial manager in the past (Tr. 85). When he married on October 2004 his wife assumed responsibility for managing their joint bank account and paying the couple\u2019s bills. His wife worked as a waitress. Unbeknownst to Applicant, his wife had was addicted to drugs and depleted the bank account on a regular basis to pay for drugs (Exh. H). The result was that the account was depleted and bills were not paid. Instead the bills were stuffed in drawers and files. Applicant was unaware that they were not being paid and did not take any action to make certain they were paid even though reminder notices from creditors continued to arrive. Several months after his marriage the family discovered that his wife had been convicted before the marriage of embezzlement of $3,000 from an employer (Tr. 23). Despite this information, she was allowed to continue to manage their accounts. In addition, it has recently come to the 3 family\u2019s attention that she obtained Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s credit card and used it illegally charging approximately $3,000.

Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn February 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn February 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 29,\n2007, for a hearing on April 11, 2007, and held that day. The government offered six exhibits (Exhs.\n1-6) and Applicant offered eleven (Exhs. A-K) into evidence. All were accepted. Applicant and his\nmother testified on his behalf. The transcript was received on May 2, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all six of the SOR allegations relating to delinquent debts with\nexplanation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a major defense contractor since August 2005\nworking as a security guard. He has delinquent debts of almost $14,000 and a salary of\napproximately $20,000 per annum. He has not been a good financial manager in the past (Tr. 85).\nWhen he married on October 2004 his wife assumed responsibility for managing their joint bank\naccount and paying the couple\u2019s bills. His wife worked as a waitress. Unbeknownst to Applicant,\nhis wife had was addicted to drugs and depleted the bank account on a regular basis to pay for drugs\n(Exh. H). The result was that the account was depleted and bills were not paid. Instead the bills were\nstuffed in drawers and files. Applicant was unaware that they were not being paid and did not take\nany action to make certain they were paid even though reminder notices from creditors continued\nto arrive. \nSeveral months after his marriage the family discovered that his wife had been convicted\nbefore the marriage of embezzlement of $3,000 from an employer (Tr. 23). Despite this information,\nshe was allowed to continue to manage their accounts. In addition, it has recently come to the\n\n3\nfamily\u2019s attention that she obtained Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s credit card and used it illegally charging\napproximately $3,000. His mother intends to file a lawsuit against his wife for the funds. Applicant\nand his wife are separated and planning to divorce, but he has yet to file a divorce petition. \nThe following is an analysis of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR:\n1. SOR 1.a.: $1,825 judgment of State of New York for state college fees incurred by\nApplicant entered August 2005 and not paid. \n2. SOR 1.b.: $1,825 judgment of State of New York for state college fees incurred by\nApplicant entered July, 2005 and not paid. While this superficially appears to be the same\ndebt as the above, it is not since there were two debts for fees to the college (Tr. 14). \n3. SOR 1.c.: $2,164 judgment for hospital care entered February 2002 and not paid. This debt\nwas incurred before his marriage (Tr.12). \n4. SOR 1.d.: $153. delinquent telephone debt placed for collection in March 2006 and not\npaid. This debt was incurred before his marriage. He has not checked with the creditor (Tr.\n46). \n5. SOR 1.e.: $7,515 delinquent credit card debt taken out by his wife and charged off in\nFebruary 2005. Applicant has been paying $100 per month for four months to settle this debt\n(Tr. 44).\n6. SOR 1.f.: $450 delinquent credit card debt charged off in July 2005. This card was taken\nout by his wife. Applicant has not been in contact with the company. \nApplicant and his wife are currently involved in a custody dispute over their one-year-old\nchild. As a result of her drug addiction his wife was treated at an addiction facility and released (Exh.\nI). He now has custody of their daughter during the week and pays $50 per week for child care. His\nwife lives with her parents and has custody on weekends. He lives in a duplex home owned by his\nparents and pays $350 per month in rent. He no longer has a credit card but has a debit card. All of\nhis other bills are current. He owns a 2000 automobile and pays $167 per month in insurance because\nof a number of traffic tickets he had incurred. He has a savings account of $350 and a checking\naccount of $1,000.\nApplicant\u2019s mother has provided a $1,500 retainer payment for his child custody counsel but\nis not certain how he will pay the balance (Tr. 67). His family provides him no continuing financial\nsupport. His father-in-law gave him $3,000 because of the problems his daughter, Applicant\u2019s wife,\nhad created for him, and the money was used to pay other bills not at issue in this proceeding. \nApplicant has a high school education and was studying to be a grade school teacher. He\nattended the state university where his delinquent debts were incurred and now are owed to the state.\nHe is within a semester of graduation but is not allowed to enroll because of his debts to the state.\nStudent loans for prior semesters at another school for $10,000 have been deferred but soon will\nrequire payment. \n\n4\nApplicant had one meeting with a credit counseling service in January 2007 but has not met\nwith them again. Because of his limited income, he was advised that it appeared unlikely they could\nbe of help (Tr. 63). He does intend to meet with them again after his divorce becomes final. At a\ncustody hearing in April 2007 concerning his daughter, he discussed a plan to pay his debts with his\ncounsel but no additional action had been taken at the time of the hearing in this matter. \nApplicant intends to pay the judgment on the two college fee delinquent debts with his 2006\ntax refund. However, despite the difficulties he has had with her handling finances, he gave his wife\nresponsibility for filing their joint return for 2006. When he checked with the Internal Revenue\nService in May the return had not been filed so is uncertain when and if he will receive a refund. \nBefore his present employment, Applicant worked between 1997 and 2005 as a house painter\nfor his father\u2019s company. During that employment he also worked for six months in 1999 for a\nrestaurant but was fired (Exh. 1). Applicant is highly thought of by his family friends and associates\nat work for his dedication to his daughter, willingness to go the last mile for friends, and acceptance\nof inconvenient work assignments (Exhs. A-F). \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nThe applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s three judgments and delinquent credit card debts prompted the allegation of\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), and\nevidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6 19 a). Applicant has such a history and\nhe has been unable to satisfy the debts even when they became known to him. He is paying on only\none of the larger debts but at a rate that it is unlikely to be resolved in the near future, and he has not\npaid the two smallest debts, which are each less than $500. \nMitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances (AG \u00b6 20 b), and the person initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 d). There is evidence the debts resulted from conditions relating\nprimarily to his wife\u2019s failure to manage their accounts and pay the delinquent debts. While his\nwife\u2019s drug habit and her spending on drugs was the principal cause of the continuing escalation of\ndebts, four of the debts were incurred before they were married (SOR 1.a.-.d.). One judgment was\nentered two years before their marriage (SOR 1.c.) Also, even if her conduct was the primary cause\nof the failure to resolve the delinquent debt problems, his failure to monitor their accounts was\nnegligent particularly after he learned after their marriage of her embezzlement of a former\nemployer\u2019s accounts. He also continued to demonstrate poor judgment to permit his wife, from\nwhom he was separated, to be responsible for filing their tax return this year despite her history of\nfinancial misconduct. \nWhile Applicant has had one session with a credit counselor and intends to seek more he has\nnot taken sufficient steps in that direction to justify establishing a MC for counseling (AG \u00b6 20 c).\nAlso, it appears both from what he was advised by the counselor and his financial information, he\nmay not be able to benefit from counseling due to limited income and the extent of his present debts\nas well as his future debts from his education loan (Tr. 63). Thus, I conclude that no mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. While Applicant is well regarded\nby his friends, associates, and supervisor at work, there has been no proof, other than good\nintentions, that the debt problems are being resolved now or will be in the near future. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\n\n6\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude it is premature to grant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 3,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 22, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant relied to her detriment\non advice from Department Counsel; and whether the Judge erred in his evaluation of the Guideline\nF mitigating conditions and in his whole person analysis.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, for such things as credit\ncards, automobile loans, consumer purchases, etc.  Though the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on\ntwo of the debts alleged in the SOR, the total for the remaining debts exceeds $20,000.  Applicant\nprovided evidence that she intended to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct in regard to her debts did not establish any of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions, nor could he clear her under a whole-person analysis.  \u201cThe lack of effective\naction to resolve these delinquent debts over the past three years when she had extra income from\nher employment, yet did not resolve any of the delinquent debts, prompts me to conclude that she\nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising from the financial considerations and that it is\npremature at this time to grant a security clearance.\u201d  Decision at 8.   Concerning Applicant\u2019s plan\nto file for bankruptcy, the Judge stated, \u201c[H]er solution of choice is to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nwhich will, if successful, completely eliminate the debts, providing no relief to her creditors.  While\nthis may have been done on the advice of her bankruptcy counsel as she testified, it does not meet\nthe requisite standard of responsible behavior . . .\u201d  Id. \nIn her appeal submission, Applicant stated that at the time of her hearing she met with\nDepartment Counsel and asked him whether Chapter 7 bankruptcy or Chapter 13 would be more\nbeneficial to her efforts to maintain a clearance.  She stated that Department Counsel advised her that\nChapter 7 was a better choice in that it removes all debt and, thereby, all attendant stress.  She stated\nthat \u201cwith that recommendation, on May 2nd 2008, I filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy based upon what\n[Department Counsel] said a DOHA judge would view as a better choice.  Viewing the judge\u2019s\nreport, filing the Chapter 7 was looked upon as I did not want to contribute anything back to the\ncreditors.  This was not the case.  I felt helpless and did not know what to do at that point and acted\nsolely off the guidance that [Department Counsel] gave.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\nDepartment Counsel filed a reply brief in which he addressed this issue.  He stated that the\nhearing took place on January 30, 2008, but that the Judge had held the record open to permit\nApplicant to submit matters describing her pre-bankruptcy credit counseling.  He further stated that\nat the hearing Applicant presented evidence to the Judge to the effect that she intended to file\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\n3\nDepartment Counsel stated that his conversation with Applicant occurred after the hearing,\nthough before the close of the record.  \u201cApplicant asked Department Counsel how the Administrative\nJudge would view her bankruptcy, either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.  Department Counsel denies\noffering any opinion as to how the assigned Administrative Judge would consider her planned\nbankruptcy filing.  Department Counsel discussed the Directive\u2019s general concern under Guideline\nF, namely that being financially overextended could cause stress in a person\u2019s life, creating the\npotential that they might resort to illegal activity involving classified information . . . Department\nCounsel informed Applicant that in his experience DOHA judges do not view bankruptcy, either\nunder Chapter 7 or 13, in a negative way and only consider it as a legal remedy that tends to mitigate\nthe government\u2019s concern by reducing the stress described earlier.  Department Counsel advised\nApplicant that she should continue to consult with her attorney and do what was best for her\nparticular financial situation.\u201d  Department Counsel\u2019s Brief at 4-5. \nWe have examined Applicant\u2019s appeal submission and Department Counsel\u2019s reply.  The\nBoard does not have authority to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Neither\ndoes the Board have the authority to supplement the record or otherwise engage in de novo fact\nfinding.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.  The Board has, in the past, remanded cases for the Judge to reopen\nthe record, as we did in ISCR Case No. 06-19169 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007), in order to clear up a\njurisdictional issue.  \nIn this case, however, there is no reason to remand the case to address the issue raised by\nApplicant.  The record as it now stands is not consistent with Applicant\u2019s contention on appeal that\nshe detrimentally relied on poor advice from Department Counsel in presenting her case.  The Board\nmakes this determination without regard to the matters asserted by Department Counsel in his reply\nbrief.  \nThe record before us indicates that Applicant had made the decision to file Chapter 7 prior\nto the January 30, 2008, hearing, but was prevented from filing because she had not satisfied\nadministrative prerequisites such as credit counseling.   Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, dated January 23,\n2008, is a letter to the Judge from Applicant\u2019s attorney, stating that \u201c[Applicant] has retained the\nservices of . . . the undersigned to represent her in filing a Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the\nMiddle District of [State].\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B is a contract, dated January 25, 2008, signed by\nthe attorney and Applicant, covering \u201cretention of services of [Attorney\u2019s Law Firm] to act as your\nattorneys in the matter of your Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E are\ndocuments submitted after the hearing which demonstrate completion of credit counseling.  There\nis nothing in these documents or in the record as a whole to suggest that, were she not facing a loss\nof her clearance, Applicant would be undertaking a different course of action in regard to her debts.\nFor example, she provided testimony at the hearing to the effect that she was seeking bankruptcy\nprotection due to her bad financial situation : \u201cI really cannot afford to pay all this debt and maintain\nmy current bills right now.  Q: Was this a course of action that was recommended to you by someone\nor did you do it on your own initiative?  A: I did it on my own.\u201d  Tr. at 46.  This testimony is\nconsistent with the finding of the Judge, quoted above, about Applicant\u2019s decision to file for\nbankruptcy being on the advice of privately-retained counsel.  \n\nThe Judge stated at the end of the hearing \u201cI would like to leave this open for approximately 30 days . . . [A]t\n1\nthat point I want you to get back to [Department Counsel] and advise him what has happened with regard to these\ncounseling sessions.  Also at that point I would like to have a letter from your bankruptcy counsel as to what steps you\nhave taken or will be taking in the next weeks thereafter, assuming that she hasn\u2019t already filed in matter in bankruptcy.\u201d\nTr. at 69.  \n4\nFurthermore, the Judge held the record open simply to provide Applicant an opportunity to\nshow that she had attended pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, rather than for her to show that she had\nmade a final decision as to Chapter 7 over Chapter 13, etc.  It appears that the matters Applicant\npresented after the hearing were in response to a request by the Judge, rather than to comments by\nDepartment Counsel.   Indeed, in her own appeal brief, Applicant states that she actually filed for\n1\nbankruptcy on May 2, 2008, which was after the Judge issued his adverse decision on April 22,\n2008.  The date of her bankruptcy filing, therefore, is not consistent with her contention on appeal\nthat she took this course of action in order to influence the Judge\u2019s decision regarding her clearance.\nThe record viewed as a whole does not corroborate Applicant\u2019s statement on appeal that she relied\nto her detriment upon advice from Department Counsel in filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and in her\npresentation of evidence in her security clearance case.\nMoreover, even if Department Counsel made improper statements to Applicant concerning\nhow DOHA Judges might evaluate certain types of evidence, there is no reason to believe that such\nstatements actually affected the outcome of the case.  The record as a whole does not support a\nconclusion that, had Applicant presented her case in another way, the outcome would have been\ndifferent.  Therefore, to the extent that Department Counsel erred, it is harmless.  See, e. g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-19544 at 4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 0706332 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9,\n2008).   \nAs to the remaining issue, the Judge\u2019s has drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts\nfound\u201d and his ultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the Guideline F\nmitigating conditions and the whole-person analysis.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national security to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision at 8.  See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (e-QIP SF 86), on August \n2, 2005. On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing, which was received by DOHA on \nNovember 26, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 14, 2007, and I received \nthe case assignment on December 20, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nJanuary 14, 2008, for a hearing on January 30, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered six exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Three were interrogatories and the answers spread over a \nperiod from January to September 2007 (Exhs. 2, 3, and 4). Applicant submitted three \nexhibits which were admitted without objection. She and one witness testified on her \nbehalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 11, 2008. I \ngranted Applicant=s request to keep the record open until March 3, 2008, to submit \nadditional evidence. Two additional documents were received on February 20, 2008, \nand admitted without objection.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nThe hearing notice was dated 16 days before the hearing date. I advised \nApplicant of her right under & E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the \nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to the 15 days notice and indicated she \nwas ready to proceed.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted ten of the eleven allegations in the \nSOR relating to approximately $23,000 in delinquent debts. She offered explanations for \nthe admitted debts and denied the other one.  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a major government contractor working as \na security official since November 2004. She served on active duty in the Army for two \nyears and was honorably discharged as an E-4 in November 1998 because of a health \nproblem related to weight. She had hoped to stay for a full tour so joined the reserves \nafter discharge and performed occasional duty tours for a few days until April 2002 \nwhen she went back on active duty. During that three and a half year period she was \nunemployed for approximately half of the time and under-employed for the other half in \nfive different jobs in several cities and states (Exh. 1). She went on a two year active \nduty tour in April 2002 at a headquarters office working on security issues. The tour \nended in March 2004.  \n \nShe was married in 1997 while in the Army and divorced in 2000. She married a \nsecond time in 2001 and was divorced on July 28, 2004 (Exh. 2). The divorce decree \nrefers to a property settlement which was not in evidence. She had no children from \neither marriage. Many of her present financial difficulties arose as a result of the \nunemployment periods low income between her two military service tours. Her two \nmarriages and divorces were also contributory factors since charges were made on \ncredit cards that were in her name for which she is legally responsible.  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant is well regarded by her employer and her supervisor who testified for \nher (Tr. 50-53). Her job is to provide assistance from her three person office to \nmembers of her company in processing security clearance applications.  \n \nThe delinquent debts at issue arose from an automobile repossession, credit \ncards used for household expenses, and service providers. A summary of the debts and \ntheir status based on testimony reveals the following (Tr. 23-35): \n \n1. SOR &1.a. This debt for $565 is for clothing and consumer items purchased \nbefore 1997. Applicant has tried to find out about paying the delinquent debt but \nthe store has no record of the transactions.   \n \n2. SOR & 1.b. This debt for $812 is from a credit card with a federal agency \ncredit union. It was consolidated with SOR & 1.d. which is with the same credit \nunion. \n \n3. SOR & 1.c. Credit card debt for $934 which has not been paid. \n \n4, SOR & 1.d. A debt to a federal credit union for $8,929 based on a loan of \n$10,000 sometime during her first active duty in the Army. She took out the loan \nto help her parents buy a home with $2,000 and purchase an auto for $3,200 (Tr. \n27-28). The remainder was used to consolidate other debts Some payments \nwere made and the balance was the subject of a judgment against Applicant in \n2000. She became aware of the judgment in 2006 when negotiating to buy a \nhome which she could not do because the judgment was outstanding.  \n \n5. SOR & 1.e. She denied a cell phone debt of $139 to the same company with \nwhich she currently has a cell phone. \n \n6. SOR & 1.f. Cable service debt of $246 taken out by her second husband which \nhas not been resolved. Another cable bill to a second company not on the SOR \nwas paid by Applicant. \n \n7. SOR & 1.g. Credit card debt of $417 incurred while on active duty and she \ncould not pay it while unemployed.  \n \n8. SOR & 1.h. Debt of $678 which she does not recognize but assumes it is valid \nbut has not investigated.  \n \n9. SOR & 1.i. Sears card debt for $618 which was not paid when she became \nunemployed and it has not been paid.  \n \n10. SOR & 1.j. Capital One credit card debt for $1,441 solely in Applicant\u2019s name \nthat is unpaid.  \n \n11. SOR & 1.k. Auto repossession debt of $9,061 on a 2003 Mitsubishi \npurchased for over $20,000 while on active duty on the second tour of duty. She \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nvoluntarily returned the auto to the dealer in March 2004 when her tour of duty \nended. She has had no contact from the creditor since moving to her present \nhome.  \n \nIn 2006 Applicant recognized that her financial problems needed to be resolved if \nshe was to keep her employment and contacted a credit counseling agency. They \nadvised her that they would not take her case since her debts were too old (Exh. 2). \nShe then went to another counseling and debt management group and entered into an \nagreement beginning November 2006 to pay them $347 per month to resolve the \noutstanding delinquent debts (Exh. 2). She paid them for seven months and then \nwithdrew from the program when she could not get an accounting she requested. She \nthen decided to seek bankruptcy protection and advised DOHA investigators in \nSeptember 2007 (Exh. 4). During the past three months Applicant has received the \nrequired credit counseling to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 (Exhs. D and \nE). She retained counsel for $1,300 for legal services in filing of the petition (Tr. 46 and \nExhs. B and C).  \n \nApplicant=s financial situation is now stable and she is current on expenses but \ncannot resolve the delinquent debts and continue to pay current debts. She purchased \na new 2007 automobile in August 2006 for $14,000 with monthly payments of $486 (Tr. \n42). She decided to purchase a new car on the advice of her father to avoid auto \nbreakdowns which had occurred in the past causing her to have problems commuting to \nwork. She co-signed for the auto with her brother since her credit rating was too low to \nqualify. In December 2007 she had an auto accident which caused a financial loss of \napproximately $500 which was her insurance deductible and she was at fault.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is $45,000 and her net pay is $1,200 bi-weekly. She \nhas received several pay increases during her three years of employment. In November \n2007 she took a second job in a retail store to improve her financial situation. She is \npaid $230 bi-weekly in the second job (Tr. 43). In an effort to cut expenses she moved \nfrom a $950 per month apartment in December 2006 (Exh. 2) to another apartment for \nwhich she pays $750 per month (Tr. 44). She has no family members to support.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge \nmust consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating eligibility for access \nfor an applicant to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG & \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe Awhole person concept.@ The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned@ (See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant number of debts including those \ncited in the SOR and was unable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. \nThe evidence shows that she has been able to pay some, but not many, of the debts \nduring the past three years yet she has not contacted many of the creditors. Thus, the \nevidence clearly raises these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of \nApplicant=s financial problems arose six to ten years ago. She now has a job which whe \nhas held over three years and pays a reasonable salary. Despite having held this \nposition for over three years, there has been little progress in paying the accounts or \ninvestigating their status.  \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s debts resulted in a judgment in 2000 in favor of a federal \nagency credit union. While her many changes of address (Exh. 1) may have contributed \nto her lack of actual knowledge of the judgment, she was well aware of the debt and the \nlocation of the account. However, nothing was done to settle the debt which had an \nadverse effect on her credit rating which she learned when attempting to buy a home. \nShe also learned the effect on her credit rating when she attempted to purchase an \nautomobile in 2006. Her employment as a security specialist working with others who \nseek security clearances should have been a red flag to her own problems and the \nneed for her to address them earlier.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), the security concern may be mitigating where Athe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ \nAs noted above, many of the financial problems arose from periods of unemployment \nand reduced income. However, there is little evidence that the two divorces had any \nsignificant impact on her financial situation as most of the debts were hers alone. \n \nApplicant has been employed with improved income for over three years and, \nwhile the cause of the debts might be a mitigating factor, her actions since her present \nemployment have not been sufficiently responsible to mitigate the security concerns. \nShe has purchased a new car since her financial problems became clear. Now her \nsolution of choice is to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy which will, if successful, completely \neliminate the debts providing no relief to her creditors. While this may have been done \non the advice of her bankruptcy counsel as she testified, it does not meet the requisite \nstandard of responsible behavior in view of her status of employment the past three \nyears to fully mitigate the security concerns.   \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control \nis a potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20(c). Applicant sought counseling and \nentered into a program from which she voluntarily withdrew after making payments for \nseveral months. She recently started counseling with the intent to file for bankruptcy, but \nthis occurred after the hearing in this matter. She chose a path of complete elimination \nof the debts with no payment to creditors. (Exh. D and E).  \n \nWhile it not necessary for mitigation to apply that all of the delinquent debts be \nresolved, it is necessary that some portion of the delinquent debts be settled or paid. \nThat test has not been met. Not a single debt listed in the SOR has been paid. Several \nhave not been investigated. Of particular concern is the largest debt to the federal \nagency credit union, a debt she certainly knew of and knew of their whereabouts. Thus, \nI conclude that the mitigating conditions do not fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was only 19 years old and was discharged from the Army before she \nexpected to be. (See AG & 2(a)(4)). She accumulated debt during periods of \nunemployment and low income from several jobs in different locations which contributed \nto her financial difficulties. Since that time she obtained a better paying job but has not \nresolved the delinquent debts.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time. I recognize her interest to \nresolve these financial issues to restore her credit rating and that she took some steps \nto try to resolve them. However, she withdrew from a program that might have been \nsuccessful and did not enter another one. She has cut her living expenses and taken a \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nsecond job which has increased her ability to resolve the debts. The lack of effective \naction to resolve these delinquent debts over the past three years when she had extra \nincome from her employment yet did not resolve any of the delinquent debts, prompts \nme to conclude that she has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the \nfinancial considerations and that it is premature at this time to grant a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:    For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:    Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:    Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:     For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:     Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:    Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:    Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:     Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:     Against Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant admitted six debts\nestablished by credit reports, but denied two.  The two he denied are medical debts that should have\nbeen paid by the military health care system.  Of the six he admitted, one is his mortgage which is\ncurrent and being paid by automatic bank payment.  Another, Applicant established has been paid\nand the lien released.  Of the remaining four debts, Applicant presented no information that they are\npaid or being paid.  He stated he would make arrangements to pay the debts.  Applicant has not met\nhis burden to establish a good faith effort to pay his debts.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nAdjudicative Guideliens promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on\nApril 19, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nof the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 24, 2007.  He admitted six and denied two\nof the allegations under Guideline F, and provided an explanation for his delinquent debts.  He\nelected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 15, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 27, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  His response was due July 27, 2007.  As of August 8, 2007, he had not responded.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He previously served 20 years\non active duty in the Army and recently retired as a sergeant first class (E-7). While on active duty,\nhe completed a security clearance application on November 24, 2003.   Subsequent investigation\n1\nrevealed Applicant had eight delinquent debts.   Applicant admitted six of the eight debts, with\n2\nexplanation, but did not  know about two debts.  \nDelinquent debts 1 (SOR 1.a) and 2 (SOR 1.f) are medical debts to the local hospital that\nhave been placed for collection.  Applicant was on active duty with the Army when the debts were\n\nSee, Item 3.\n3\nId.\n4\nItem 3, Attachment 2.\n5\nItem 4, response to question 38.\n6\nItem 3, Attachment 1.\n7\nItem 3 at 2.\n8\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n9\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n10\n3\nincurred in May and October 2001.  As such, Applicant and his family were covered by the military\nhealth care system and the bills should have paid by them.  Applicant has inquired about the military\nhealth care system paying the debts.3\nDelinquent debt 3 (SOR 1.b) is a credit card debt to Capital One for $863.  Applicant thought\nhe had paid the debt and stated he would settle it in the next 90 days.  Delinquent debt 4 (SOR 1.c)\nis for a Military Star credit card in the amount of $2,785.  Applicant stated he made payment\narrangements.  Delinquent debt 5 (SOR 1.g) is to Bank of America on a car loan.  Applicant\nacknowledged the debt and stated he required time to clear the debt.  Delinquent debt 6 (SOR 1.h)\nis to MBNA bank on a credit card debt.  Applicant acknowledged the debt and stated he would make\npayment arrangements.4\nDelinquent debt 7 (SOR 1. d) is to Bank One on a car loan.  This debt has been paid and the\nlien released.   Delinquent debt 8 (SOR 1.e) is for the mortgage on Applicant\u2019s residence.  Applicant\n5\nstated his father was living in the house and was suppose to make the house payment.  On his return\nfrom an overseas assignment, he learned his father had not made the payments.   The mortgage is\n6\ncurrent and Applicant established an automatic payment plan for the mortgage.7\nApplicant explained that his financial troubles started in 2001 when he was assigned to\nGermany and lost his housing allowance but still had a house payment.  The family also lost income\nwhen his wife was injured on her job and received only workman\u2019s compensation, which was\napproximately $1,500 less per month then her normal pay.8\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n9\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.10\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\n\nAG \u00b6 2(a).\n11\nId.\n12\nSee Exec.

The adjudicative guidelines for this case are the guidelines promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Each\nclearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, and the whole person concept.11\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.12\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n13\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.14\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n15\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n16\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n17\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\n\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n18\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n19\n5\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n18\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d19\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists because a failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit reports and admitted by Applicant brings the matter\nwithin Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (Inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations).  Since Applicant\nadmits six of the eight debts, I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nAppellant\u2019s answer to the SOR raises Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FC MC)\n\u00b6 20(a) (The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgement), FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (The conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances), and FC MC 20(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  Applicant was not responsible for two of the debts\n(SOR 1. a and f) since the debts arose from medical treatment covered by the military health care\nsystem.  He presented sufficient information that one of the debts (SOR 1.d) was paid in full and the\nlien released.   Applicant presented sufficient information that his mortgage debt (SOR 1.e) is current\nand paid by automatic bank payment.  He also presented sufficient information to establish that the\n\n6\ndebt was accumulated when his father did not pay the mortgage as agreed.  \nThe four remaining debts, (SOR, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h), were incurred after 2001 and still are\nunresolved.  There is more than one debt so the accumulation of delinquent debts was frequent.  While\nhis circumstances changed when he was on an overseas assignment and his wife received only\nworkman\u2019s compensation payments, there is no indication that these circumstances affected his ability\nto resolve and pay the four remaining debts.  The family did receive some level of income from the\nworkman\u2019s compensation that would permit some payments on these four debts.  The debts are not\nlarge or the accumulated amount substantial.  Applicant presented no information to indicate that under\nsimilar circumstances, he would not again incur delinquent debts.  Additionally, Applicant did not\nexplain why the delinquent debts were accumulated so there is no indication the debts resulted from\nconditions beyond his control\nApplicant stated he would make inquiries and pay these four debts in the future, but presented\nno proof of any inquiries or attempts to make payments.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one\naspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  A person\u2019s\nrelationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability\nor unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or\nmitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in\na situation of risk inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required\nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial\nobligations. An intention to pay debts in the future is not sufficient to establish a good-faith effort to\npay the debts.  Applicant admitted the four debts and took no action to pay or resolve them\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.  Applicant has shown an\nirresponsible attitude toward his debts.  He presented insufficient information to explain the debts or\nmitigate the disqualifying conditions.  He has failed to carry his burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate\nfour debts.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue access to classified information for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nThomas M.

Applicant answered the SOR 13 November 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 3 January 2008, and I convened a hearing 14 February\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 22 February 2008.\n \nFebruary 29, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his\nadmissions as findings of fact. He is a 33-year-old computer technician employed by a\ndefense contractor since September 2003. He seeks to retain the security clearance he\nobtained while in the military in 1995.\nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested for DUI, and ultimately convicted. Aside from its\nsignificance as adverse information required to be disclosed to the government, the\n1998 arrest has no independent security significance as criminal conduct or alcohol\nconsumption.\nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in September 2001 (G.E. 1),  he\ndeliberately concealed his DUI conviction by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 24 (alcohol/\ndrug arrests). He repeated this false answer on an October 2002 clearance application\n(G.E. 2). In January 2003, Applicant was polygraphed by another government agency\nbecause he was seeking access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In\nAugust 2003, he was denied access to SCI for reasons largely irrelevant to his current\napplication. However, he appears to have retained his security clearance.\nIn July 2004, Applicant deliberately concealed his DUI arrest and his SCI access\ndenial by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions 23(d) (alcohol/drug arrests) and 26(b)\n(clearance/access denied/suspended/revoked) (G.E. 1). In his September 2004 sworn\nstatement (G.E. 4), he acknowledged that he purposely omitted this information\nbecause he did not want to have his clearance revoked, because he needed it to retain\nhis job. At hearing, he suggested\u2014incredibly\u2014that he omitted the information because\nhe thought the government already had it. He acknowledged that the clearance\napplications were not being sent anywhere that the information was known.\nApplicant expresses remorse for his falsifications. His character references, who\ninclude his wife, a coworker, and a supervisor, extol his work ethic and integrity. None\nbut his wife appear aware of the issues in this case.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\n3\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n4\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n3\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J and E,\nand Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his DUI\narrest (and later his access denial) from the government.  He did so knowing that these\n3\nissues were of security concern to the government, and believing that his clearance was\nat risk if he told the truth.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications kept the government from\nevaluating his DUI arrest (and access denial) in a timely fashion, and at a time when the\narrest particularly might have raised significant security concerns. Applicant did not\ndisclose the arrest until his polygraph.  But he continued to conceal the arrest on his\n4\nclearance application in July 2004.\nRecord evidence clearly establishes that Applicant intended to conceal his DUI\narrest and later access denial from the government and effect the course of his\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n5\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n4\nbackground investigation. This conduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001,  whether or not he\n5\nwas successful in effecting the course of his investigation. However, in this case his\nfalsifications did alter the investigation, as it appears he was granted his clearance at\nleast twice because of it.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his DUI arrest and access denial demonstrates a\nlack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in\nexamining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before\nmaking a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose\nthat adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or\nconvenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline J and E against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Falsifications\nare a core security concern [RAG &2(a)(1)]. His behavior was deliberate and not due to\ncircumstances beyond his control [RAG &2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. His misconduct was\nboth recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)]. Applicant was not a neophyte when he made\nhis falsifications, and as a military member had better reason than most to know the\nnecessity of being truthful on his clearance applications [RAG &2(a)(4).)]. Rehabilitation\nor behavioral changes are difficult to measure under these circumstances [RAG &\n2(a)(6)]. He clearly sought to mislead the government about his DUI arrest and later\naccess denial, or was at least willing to benefit from his misconduct [RAG &2(a)(7)].\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests increases his potential vulnerability and he has not demonstrated that the\nmisconduct is unlikely to recur [RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is whether\nApplicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberate or inadvertent,\nthat raise security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt\nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nfalsifications.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

There is no evidence in the record to indicate whether that passport, or a required replacement,\nwas still valid in 1996, when the format change precipitated Applicant\u2019s action in renewing her Taiwanese passport.\n2\nThe government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that Applicant was at heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of her limited family\nconnections to Taiwan. She also established a clear preference for the U.S. Clearance granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 16 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nunresolved foreign preference and foreign influence concerns.  On 8 May 2007, she answered the\n1\nSOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 12 July 2007 and I convened a hearing\n30 August 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 12 September 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt hearing, Department Counsel conceded that the record evidence produced by Applicant\nin her Answer and at her hearing demonstrated that, while the government had a good faith basis for\nallegation 1.b., the allegation was ultimately refuted by unequivocal evidence. Accordingly, I find\nallegation 1.b. for Applicant.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR, 1.b. Accordingly, I\nincorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 51-year-old assistant facility security officer\nfor a defense contractor, and seeks reinstatement of the interim clearance she held without incident\nfrom approximately 2004 until January 2007.\nApplicant was born in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in March 1956.  She grew up there\nand was educated there. She married in August 1979, and she and her husband immigrated to the\nU.S. in 1980. They had a daughter in September 1985, and a son in November 1987, both native-\nborn U.S. citizens. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1987. Her husband had\nalso become a naturalized U.S. citizen, but he died in March 1993. All of Applicant\u2019s financial\ninterests are in the U.S. She has no intent to return to Taiwan to live.\nApplicant obtained her first U.S. passport in February 1988. She renewed it in May 1998. In\n1996, Applicant learned from a friend that Taiwan was changing the format for its passports.\nWithout thinking about the fact that, as a U.S. citizen, she no longer needed a Taiwanese passport,2\nshe re-applied for a Taiwanese passport in February 1996. She never used this passport to travel or\n\n3\nfor any other purpose. All her foreign travel\u2014including her return trips to Taiwan\u2014have been on\nher U.S. passports. She use her U.S. passport, with appropriate Taiwanese visas, to travel there in\n2000 and 2007. Her Taiwanese passport expired in February 2002. She has no intent to renew it.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Now 80 and 71 years old, they are\nretired from jobs that were not connected to the government of Taiwan. They are financially\nindependent, and live on their own. Applicant provides no financial support. She contacts them\noccasionally to see how they are doing and check on their health. However, in Chinese culture, the\nultimate responsibility for caring for her parents resides with her brother.\nApplicant is the oldest of four children. Her next oldest sister resides in the U.S. and is in the\nprocess of obtaining her U.S. citizenship. She has a brother and sister who are citizens and residents\nof Taiwan. Her brother works for a retail chain store, and her sister is a homemaker who helps her\nhusband in their gift shop. These employments are not connected to the government of Taiwan.\nApplicant\u2019s siblings are financially independent, and receive no financial support from her. She has\ninfrequent contact with them.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy, whose authorities generally respect the human rights of\nits citizens. While Taiwan is an active collector of industrial information and engages in industrial\nespionage, the record does not demonstrate that the government of Taiwan targets U.S. intelligence\ninformation. Further, the record does not demonstrate that it seeks to exert pressure on its citizens\nto collect information from family members residing in country or abroad.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors ( the company facility security officer) testified how\nextremely trustworthy she found her over the more-than-five years she supervised her, a sentiment\nthat was echoed in her character references from her current employer (A.E. C). In addition, she has\nnever had a security violation.\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the\nfactors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\nmitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent\npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the\nSOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n4\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n5\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n6\ninvalidated; \n4\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.3\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by showing that\nApplicant obtained a Taiwanese passport in February 1996, despite becoming a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in October 1987.  However, Applicant mitigated the Guideline C security concerns. Although\n4\nshe has been a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States since her birth, her Taiwanese\ncitizenship has little security significance because it is based solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship.   For\n5\nher conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, she must have acted in a way to\nindicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or\ndetrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before the government can\nseek to deny access under Guideline C. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring those\nentrusted with this nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of\nwhich they may also be a citizen.\n \nApplicant\u2019s active exercise of dual citizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen was\ndone deliberately, but unwittingly. She was not aware of any prohibition on holding a foreign\npassport. Indeed, there is no such proscription except in the context of clearance adjudications. She\nnever used the passport for any purpose. She has expressed a willingness to surrender the passport,\nand in any event, the passport expired over five years ago.  Further, given her work performance\n6\nwhile holding an interim clearance from 2004 to January 2007, she demonstrated that she can be\ncounted on to always act in preference to the United States. I resolve Guideline C for Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n7\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n8\n5\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n7\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.8\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering first the country involved, Taiwan and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign relations.\nTaiwan has not been demonstrated to target protected U.S. information, nor has it been demonstrated\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. The risk that Taiwan might seek protected\ninformation from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence that there was\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because\nof Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Taiwan. Applicant has resided in the U.S. longer than she\nlived in Taiwan. Her financial and most important family connections are all in the U.S. Her contacts\nwith her parents and siblings are minimal. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in\nTaiwan, or in Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that she could be impelled or\ncompelled to provide protected information to Taiwan. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Her\nhusband sustained disabling injuries in two separate automobile accidents, which impacted his ability\nto obtain and maintain steady employment. In the last 10 years, Applicant always worked. At times,\nonly her income paid the bills. She continues to timely pay her bills, has paid several delinquent bills,\nand initiated payment plans for all but one long delinquent debt barred from collection under state\nlaw. She has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns regarding her finances. Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On January 23, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. She\nrequested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on February 12, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on\nMarch 5, 2007, which Applicant received 11 days before the hearing. At the hearing on March 20,\n2007, Applicant waived her right to receive notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I\nconducted the hearing as scheduled.  The government submitted six exhibits (GE) which were\n1\nmarked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted five exhibits\n(App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App Ex A-E without objection. Applicant and one\nwitness testified. I held the record open until April 10, 2007, for Applicant to submit further\ndocuments, which she did. Applicant submitted ten additional documents, which were marked and\nadmitted as App Ex F through O without objection. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on\nMarch 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F of the SOR.  Those admissions are\n2\nincorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated September30, 2005) at 1-2; App Ex A (Undated letter);\n3\nApp Ex O (March 2007 performance evaluation); Tr. at 20-21.\nApp Ex B (Air Guard evaluation); App Ex K (Letter dated March 23, 2007); Tr. at 19-21, 72\u201374.\n4\nTr. at 27, 40-42, 44-45, 47-50.\n5\nId. at 67.\n6\n3\nApplicant, a 41-year-old woman, holds an Associate of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Science\ndegree in business management. She works as a financial analyst for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. She seeks a clearance to increase her career opportunities with her employer. Her\nsupervisor describes her as a person of outstanding character and professional abilities. She always\ngets the job done and is quick to learn. She received her latest performance evaluation in March\n2007. Her supervisor rated her overall at Level 4, the second highest rating.3\nApplicant enlisted in the United States Air Force reserves six years ago. She is a staff\nsergeant whose duties involve personnel administration. She does not have a security clearance as\na reservist. Her Air Force Guard supervisor testified on her behalf. She described Applicant as her\nnumber one right-hand woman. She stated that Applicant is professional and courteous. Applicant\nprovided excellent customer service and goes above and beyond in the performance of her duties.\nHer most recent performance rating indicated that she needed little or no improvement in her\nperformance. Her minister, who is also a city councilman, described her as a person of good moral\ncharacter and a person who can be trusted.4\nApplicant married in 1991. Her 19-year-old step-daughter is a college student. Her son is 10\nyears old. At the time of her marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband worked as a machinist mate in the\nUnited States Navy. In 1993, he suffered a back injury in an automobile accident, which resulted in\na 30% disability rating and a disability discharge from the Navy in December 1995. Applicant and\nher husband accepted a lump sum severance payment of $35,000 at this time. Because she was\npregnant and they were unemployed, they moved in with her mother while her husband\nunsuccessfully attempted to develop a new work career in her step-father\u2019s construction business.\nAfter paying taxes, they used the proceeds from the lump sum payment to pay bills and to invest in\nher step-father\u2019s business.5\nApplicant and her husband retained a lawyer to represent them for the damages they sustained\nas a result of the 1993 car accident. They eventually settled their case. Their lawyer received\napproximately $33,000 in fees, and under its subrogation rights, the Navy recovered the cost of the\nmedical services it rendered to her husband. They received about $25,000, which they used for living\nexpenses and bills. A few years later, her husband sustained an injury to his shoulder in a one-car\nautomobile accident. They received a $3,500 settlement for his injuries.6\nApplicant began her current employment in 1997. At the same time, her husband started\nworking as a contractor for the same employer. The employer furloughed her husband in 1998. Her\nhusband then obtained a manufacturing job, but because of his shoulder injury, he could not perform\nthe duties of the job. Likewise, because of his back injury, he cannot do heavy lifting jobs. For the\nlast ten years, Applicant has worked steadily, but her husband has been unable to obtain full-time\n\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 2; Tr. at 21, 28-30.\n7\nGE 4 (Credit report, dated January 17, 2001); GE 5(Credit report, dated October 26, 2005); GE 6 (Credit\n8\nreport, dated October 17, 2006).\nApp Ex I (Copy of cancelled check, dated July 19, 2006); App Ex J (Copy of cancelled check, dated August\n9\n2, 2006).\nApp Ex L (Copy of cancelled checks, dated January 30, 2007 and February 28, 2007); App Ex M (Copy of\n10\ncancelled checks, dated January 30, 2007 and February 28, 2007); App Ex N (Copy of cancelled checks, dated January\n30, 2007 and February 28, 2007); Tr. at 23-25,30-32, 65.\n4\nsteady employment, which impacted their ability to pay bills.

She paid the two small\ndelinquent medical bills in July and August 2006.  She recently made arrangements to make monthly\n9\npayments on three of her four remaining delinquent debts. She will pay $100 a month on her largest\ncredit card debt, $100 a month on the one remaining medical bill, and $75 a month on the remaining\ncredit card debt. She obtained a gasoline credit card 20 years ago. She timely paid the card and paid\nthe bill in full. Not long after her marriage, she added her mother to this credit card account as an\nauthorized user. The credit card company gave her mother a separate card and mailed the monthly\nbills to her mother, who paid the bills for awhile, then stopped paying the bill. Her mother never\nadvised her that the bill had not been paid. In her efforts to resolve this debt, she learned that the\ncreditor is no longer in business. The new owner of the company cannot locate an account in her\nname. With the exception of the unpaid medical bill, all the accounts listed in the SOR were time\nbarred from collection under state law.10\nApplicant earns approximately $3,461 a month in gross salary, including her recent merit pay\nincrease, with a net monthly pay of approximately $2,436. From her reserve duty, she receives\n\nApp Ex G (Copies of Applicant\u2019s last three paycheck statements); App Ex H (Copies of Applicant\u2019s military\n11\npay statements for January, February and March 2007).\nHer husband\u2019s employer did not deduct taxes from his pay.

Her total net monthly income is approximately $2,693.  Her\n11\nhusband anticipates that he will earn approximately $25,000 this year from his employment. Because\nhis work is directly related to good golfing weather, his monthly earnings fluctuate. She anticipates\nhis income will increase as the weather for golf improves. In March 2007, her husband contributed\n$562 before taxes to the household income and will contribute approximately $1,300 before taxes\nin April 2007. Her husband occasionally performs side jobs for which he receives payments. The\namount of his earnings is unknown.12\nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenses include a mortgage payment of $1400, two car payments\ntotaling $1,088, utilities of $242, gasoline of $300, car insurance of $321, food of $125,\nmiscellaneous expenses of $75 and credit card payments of approximately $200 for total monthly\nexpenses of $3,751. Her credit reports reflect that she timely pays her existing credit cards and other\ndebts.  In addition, Applicant will resume paying her education loan in June 2007. She estimates\n13\nthis payment at $115.  Under the payment agreements she established, Applicant pays $275 a month\n14\non her delinquent debts for total additional expenses of almost $400 a month.\nThe SOR alleges that the Air Force denied Applicant a security clearance based on financial\nconsiderations. She admits that she does not have a clearance, but denies that it was for financial\nreasons. She met with an investigator and signed a statement on May 14, 2001 acknowledging the\ndebts identified in allegations 1.c, 1.f and 1.g. She also stated that her husband was not working and\nthat she was the sole provider for the family and that she would start paying the debts when her\nhusband began working full-time. She had no further contact with anyone from the Air Force until\nseveral years later, when her supervisor requested her to sign a letter acknowledging the denial of\nher clearance for non-compliance. She believes that the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility may\nhave sent her a letter requesting information similar to that which has been requested for this\napplication. She never received the letter.  The government has not provided any documentation\n15\nwhich sets forth the reasons for the denial of her clearance by the Air Force, or establishes that she\nwas properly served with the documents related to her prior denial.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n16\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n17\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.16\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n17\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n19\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n20\nclearance decision.21\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n22\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n23\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n24\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n25\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18.) Applicant has significant unpaid old debt, which\noccurred when her husband was unemployed. Based on the evidence of record, DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability\n\u2026 to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s debt problems arose because of several events in the past. Her husband suffered\na significant injury in a car accident which led to his discharge from the Navy and an inability to\nwork in his chosen career. During the 11 years subsequent to his discharged, her husband has not\nworked steadily. His inability to find steady full-time employment impacted their ability to pay\nmonthly living expenses. For awhile, they financed normal living expenses with credit cards.\nHowever, they stopped paying two credit card debts when he lost his job in 1998. Since this time,\nhis employment has not been steady and reliable. Thus, their inability to resolve these debts\ncontinued. She denied, until recently, any knowledge of the debt alleged in paragraph 1.b of the\nSOR. Many years ago, she added her mother to this account as an authorized user. The creditor\nprovided her mother was a separate credit car and mailed the bills to her mother. Her mother,\nhowever, never told her about this unpaid debt. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances applies because of her husband\u2019s unemployment and her\nmother\u2019s withholding of information on the payment of a credit card debt. \nApplicant has not retained the services of a financial counselor. Thus, MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control does not apply. \nApplicant paid the two smallest debts listed in the SOR about nine months ago. Three months\nago, she verbally advised the creditors for the two largest delinquent s debts and the one remaining\nmedical bill that she would begin payments on these debts. In compliance with her promise, she\nbegan monthly payments on these time barred debts in January 2007. She has attempted to locate the\ncreditor for her very oldest debt. Because of the age of this debt and the sale of the creditor company,\nshe has been unable to develop a payment plan for this debt, which cannot be collected under state\nlaw. MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts applies.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n26\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n8\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nUnder the 3-year State\u2019s statute of limitations, which applies to 5 of her 6 unpaid SOR debts,\nthe creditors were time barred from collecting these debts.  The State Court of Appeals succinctly\n26\nexplained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes\nof limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their\nrights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). Thus, the debt alleged in 1.b is time barred from collection. However,\nin light of Applicant\u2019s recent payments on the debts alleged in allegations 1.c, 1.f and 1.g, the 3-year\nperiod from which a creditor can seek collection through legal process begins again. State Code \u00b6\n15-3-120. \nApplicant and her husband used his severance payment to pay existing debts in 1996 and to\npay for living expenses. They lived with her mother to reduce expenses while they started to rebuild\ntheir work careers after his injury and discharge from the Navy. By 1997, both were working. In\n1998, her husband lost his job, and although he found new work, his shoulder injury along with his\nback injury ended his ability to work at this job or other jobs requiring heavy physical labor. During\nthis time they got behind in their bills. Her husband has worked off and on over the last 10 years.\nWhile she has been able to keep current on their normal living expenses, she could not repay their\nold debt. Her regular bills are current. \nWith the exception of the $690 medical bill, the debts listed in the SOR could not be\ncollected because the creditor had been barred by the state statute of limitations from legally\ncollecting this debt. However, her agreement to pay these debts removes the statute of limitations\nfor the creditor. By initiating payments on this debt, Applicant has acted responsibly.\nApplicant\u2019s current expenses exceed her monthly bills by a significant amount each month.\nWhile the credit reports indicate that she is current on her monthly payments, a concern arises about\nhow she continues to pay her monthly obligations, that she may be over extended, and thus, unable\nto meet the commitments she has made. Her husband\u2019s monthly income will improve during the golf\n\n9\nseason, which will lessen the financial stress during that period of time, and is a factor to consider.\nHis supplement income from odd jobs must also be considered in assessing her overall financial\nsituation. She and her husband are living right on the edge within their means.\nHer employer praises her work skills and work ethic. Her latest performance appraises gives\nher the second highest employee rating. Likewise, she is highly respected for her work in the Air\nForce reserves. In reviewing all the facts of this case, there is little potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress. I have weighed the applicable mitigating factors, her responsible conduct in\npaying old debt, and her current financial situation. Since she stopped her two credit card payments\nin 1998 or 1999, she has not incurred any large, unpaid debt. Her unpaid medical expense debts\ntotaled less than $1,000, and is now around $500. Despite the periodic loss of her husband\u2019s income,\nshe managed to continue to regularly pay her bills. Although she continues to juggle her finances,\nshe remains timely on her debt payments. She has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is found in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-g: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

As a juvenile and young adult he was involved in a gang. He was\ncharged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was on probation for five years. He had\nother minor criminal offenses and traffic violations checkered throughout his youth. He has changed\nhis behavior and is committed to leading a law abiding life and has proved he can do so. He divulged\nhis serious offense on his security clearance application, but was confused in answering some other\nquestions. I find Applicant has successfully mitigated security concerns raised under Guidelines E,\npersonal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 28, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (personal conduct) and\nGuideline J (criminal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005,\nand implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nFebruary 20, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on March 13, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on April\n19, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered three exhibits that were marked as GE\n1-3 and admitted without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf and had no exhibits.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 26 years old and has worked as a facilities operations assistant for a federal\ncontractor since November 2004. He graduated from high school in 2000. He is married and has a\nfour-year-old child. \nApplicant was a member of a gang from 1998 to 2000. Gang membership was based on\ngeography and what neighborhood you lived in. He was involved in drawing graffiti, but backed\naway when any fighting ensued.  The gang was not involved in any other illegal activities. \n1\nApplicant was arrested on June 23, 1998, and charged with possession of marijuana. He was\nsitting in a car with three friends. The marijuana was in between the driver\u2019s seat and passenger\u2019s\n\nTr. 43-46.\n2\nTr. 49-50.\n3\nTr. 55\n4\nTr. 56-59.\n5\nTr. 63.\n6\nTr. 66.\n7\nTr. 64.\n8\nTr. 47-48, 63.\n9\nTr. 72.\n10\nTr. 65.\n11\nTr. 75.\n12\n3\nseat. Applicant was sitting in the back seat. He stated it was not his marijuana, in that he did not\npurchase it, but took responsibility for it and was arrested.  He was placed on probation. \n2\nOn September 17, 1999, Applicant received a citation for being in possession of alcohol as\na minor. He was attending a party and the police arrived. Many of the other attendees also received\ncitations.  He paid the fine. \n3\nApplicant and a student from his school were involved in a fight at school. The day before\nthe fight Applicant was accosted by the student and his adult brother. The older brother reached into\na car that Applicant was sitting in and hit him.  Applicant and the driver of the car drove away. The\n4\nnext day at school Applicant and the other student went into the restroom. Applicant stated the other\nstudent took a swing at him first so Applicant punched him in the jaw with his fist.  No other persons\n5\nwere involved in the fight or witnessed it, and no weapon was used. Applicant broke the student\u2019s\njaw.  He was arrested on October 14, 1999, and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly\n6\nweapon. Applicant credibly testified that he did not use a weapon and only used his fist.  At court\n7\nhe received deferred adjudication and was sentenced to five years probation, 240 hours of\ncommunity service, a $20,000 fine, and was required to pay restitution for medical costs of $7,536.8\nApplicant had been serving probation from his previous arrest in June 1998. That charge was\ndismissed as part of the plea bargain on the assault charge.  Applicant completed paying the $20,000\n9\nand restitution in February 2005.  He worked to pay the fines.  He was expelled from school for\n10\n11\nthe offense and attended an alternative high school. He completed high school and graduated. \nWhile on probation for the assault charge, Applicant was charged with being in possession\nof alcohol as a minor on July 29, 2000. On July 7, 2001, Applicant was charged with three minor\ntraffic offenses and having \u201calcohol detectable,\u201d again while on probation.  He was ordered into\n12\ncustody at an Intermediate Sanction Facility, where he stayed for two months. Because there was a\n\nTr. 80.\n13\nTr. 75.\n14\nQuestion 26 asks the Applicant if there are any other offenses, in the last seven years, that he has not already\n15\nlisted and he is to include traffic offenses, if the fine is over $150.\nQuestion 24 asks the Applicant if he has ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to drugs\n16\nor alcohol. \nTr. 85-88.\n17\n4\nwaiting list he did not go into custody until February 2003, and remained there until April 2003.13\nApplicant had been working at a motorcycle shop from September 2001 to January 2003. He had\nto leave his job to be confined.  \n14\nFrom approximately November 2000 to March 2005, Applicant was charged or cited nine\ntimes for traffic violations, including speeding, failure to yield right of way, failing to wear a seat\nbelt, and failure to maintain financial responsibility (i.e. no insurance). He received fines, some over\n$150, and paid them. He presently maintains insurance on his car. \nWhen filling out his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant failed to list his traffic\nviolations that had fines over $150, as was required.  He did list his aggravated assault charge, but\n15\nalso failed to list the possession of marijuana and being in possession of alcohol as a minor, as was\nalso required.  Applicant credibly testified that he forgot about the other charges and with regard\n16\nto the tickets, he did not remember how much the fines were for, so did not include them. He\nexplained he did not know what to put down and was unaware that he could list the tickets and\nexplain he did not know how much the fines were.  I find Applicant\u2019s testimony to be truthful and\n17\nthat he did not intentionally attempt to hide adverse information about his past. He credibly testified\nabout his past and was candid and forthcoming with information. It was obvious from his testimony\nthat he is unfamiliar with filling out forms and had trouble understanding the questions. I believe\nApplicant made an unintentional error when he failed to provide the correct information and was not\ntrying to be deceptive. \nApplicant no longer is part of a gang and no longer associates with its members. Like him,\nmany of the members now have wives and families and have moved on in their lives. Applicant is\nsorry for his past, but accepts the fact that he can not change it, but must move forward to make a\nlife for his wife and son. The Facilities Security Officer (FSO), a retired Marine, and a former special\nagent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service as a criminal investigator, before assuming his\ncurrent duties, testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Not one easily swayed, he truly believes Applicant\nhas turned his life around and is now a productive member of society and an outstanding worker and\nasset to the company. He knows Applicant is a sought after employee because of his work ethic,\nenthusiasm, and dedication. He also believes he has great potential. Applicant willingly volunteers\nto take on new duties and is trusted by the FSO and his supervisors. The FSO is aware of Applicant\u2019s\nbackground and difficulties, but believes he has learned his lesson and has demonstrated a\nwillingness to step up and take responsibility for his actions. He believes most of Applicant\u2019s\nproblems were due to his difficult youth and he has now moved on. I find Applicant was extremely\ncredible in acknowledging his mistakes, not blaming others and taking responsibility. He never\n\nTr. 91-92.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

His\nFSO believes Applicant to be trustworthy and possesses the integrity to hold a security clearance.\nApplicant has three younger brothers and he has tried to set an example and steer them from\nmaking the same mistakes that he did in the past.  Applicant has goals for the future and hopes to\n18\nimprove and move up in the company. He understands that he must abide by and follow all the laws\nand regulations, including traffic rules. He acknowledges he has wasted a great deal of money on\ntickets, that could be better spent on his son. He is committed to leading a conscientious law abiding\nlifestyle.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n19\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n20\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201c only upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n21\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n22\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n23\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n24\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n25\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.26\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\n\n6\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), PC DC 16(d) (credible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, . . .unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . .(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations),\nPC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates\na vulnerabilty to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal ,professional ,or community standing. . .), and 16(g)\n(association with persons involved in criminal activity.) \n\n7\nBased on all of the evidence, including considering Applicant\u2019s demeanor, attitude, and\ncandor, I find he did not intentionally falsify his SCA. Applicant was clearly confused about what\nhe could write down on his SCA. He admitted to the most serious and aggravating charge. I do not\nbelieve Applicant deliberately failed to list his traffic violations and minor offenses. He was clearly\nfocused on the offense that was most serious. I find Applicant did not intentionally and deliberately\nlie on his security clearance application, and therefore I find he did not violate Title 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001.\nI have also considered all of the evidence when analyzing Applicant\u2019s long history of traffic\nviolations and his gang activity. He failed to follow the traffic laws starting in 2000 and his most\nrecent violation was in 2005. Applicant admitted his gang activity lasted from approximately 1998\nto 2000. I find PC DC 16(d), (d) and (g) apply because Applicant\u2019s conduct represents a pattern of\nrule violations. His gang activity shows his involvement with persons involved in criminal activity\nand his past personal conduct creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress.\nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior\nis unlikely to recur), PC MC 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress), and PC MC (g) (association with persons\ninvolved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with the rules and\nregulations.). Applicant\u2019s conduct as a gang member happened almost seven years ago. He no longer\nassociates with the gang or its members. His gang activity is part of his youth and he is working hard\nto show he has become a productive member of society. Regarding his traffic violations, Applicant\nis fully aware of the gravity of having so many offenses. He admitted that these violations have cost\nhim a great deal of money in fines which could be better spent on his family. He has not had a ticket\nsince 2005, and was credible in his testimony that he intends on complying with all the rules and\nregulations of the road. It has been more than two years since his last traffic violation. Applicant has\nawakened to the reality that he is an adult and must comply with the rules of society if he wants to\nsucceed. He provided sufficient evidence to show he is working hard to succeed and can be trusted.\nI find PC MC 17 (d), (e) and (g) apply.\nBased on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31(b) (allegations or admissions of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted),\napply. Applicant was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 1999. He received\ndeferred adjudication. Applicant also was arrested for being a minor in possession of alcohol (1999\nand 2000) and possession of marijuana (1998). He was a member of a gang from 1998-2000, and\nadmitted drawing graffiti.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32(d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\n\n8\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). \nApplicant credibly testified that he belonged to a gang, drew graffiti, but that was the extent\nof his gang activity. He has not been part of a gang since 2000. He no longer associates with gang\nmembers, most of whom have moved on also. He committed other minor offenses of possessing\nmarijuana and alcohol as a minor. They occurred in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The most serious criminal\noffense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon occurred while Applicant was in high school.\nHe denied using an actual weapon, but admitted he broke the victim\u2019s jaw. Applicant completed five\nyears of probation and did a great deal of growing up during that time. He paid a $20,000 fine and\nover $7,000 in restitution. He served some time in a correctional facility because of his failure to\ncomply with the terms of his probation. It was a true wake up call. It is apparent Applicant had a\ndifficult youth. Except for the assault charge, most of the offenses were minor, but there were\nnumerous offenses. \nApplicant has not been in criminal trouble since 2000, excluding traffic offenses. He has a\ngood job and is committed to abiding by the law. He has set goals at work and hopes to improve and\nhave a long term career with his company. His reputation at the company is excellent. He\nunderstands the error of his ways and is trying hard to put his past behind him and work on his\nfuture. He gives his wife his pay check and is devoted to both her and their son. Applicant admittedly\nhas made mistakes, acknowledges them, is remorseful, and now is working hard to be a productive\nmember of society.He has warned his younger brothers about the mistakes he made, so they do not\nrepeat them. He no longer associates with his old friends. He is committed to his family. Applicant\u2019s\nrecent history reflects a changed man, a success story for putting his past behind him and working\nhard to achieve a better life.  The offenses are not recent and enough time has passed that Applicant\nhas proven himself that he has changed his behavior and it is unlikely that he will get in trouble\nagain. He has proven over the past couple of years that he can be trusted and exercises good\njudgment. I find CC MC 32(a) and (d) apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant is maturing as a responsible career oriented\nyoung man. He has hopes and goals and wants to achieve them and is willing to work hard to do so.\nHe must live with his checkered past and can not avoid it, but he has made significant progress by\nbeing a responsible and trustworthy employee. Based on my analysis above and my opportunity to\njudge Applicant\u2019s demeanor, credibility, sincerity and commitment to living within the rules of\nsociety, I am convinced he is a changed man and is deserving of a security clearance. Therefore,\n\n9\nbased on the totality of the evidence, I find Applicant has successfully mitigated the security\nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-2.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR), dated January 27, 2006, advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On August 31, 2007, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal Applicant contends that the SOR in this case was misdated as January 27, 2006,\nwhen in fact it was issued in January 2007 and received by him in February 2007.  Because of this\npossible misdating error, Applicant contends that the Judge applied the wrong Guidelines in his\ncase\u2014that is, the old Guidelines for SORs issued prior to September 1, 2006, rather than the new\nGuidelines for SORs issued after that date.\n \nNormally, an applicant must submit his answer \u201c. . . within 20 days from receipt of the SOR.\u201d\nDirective at \u00b6 E3.1.4.  If an applicant does not file a timely answer, DOHA may discontinue\nprocessing his case and deny him a clearance.  Directive at \u00b6 E3.1.5.  A review of the record\nindicates that Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was dated February 9, 2007 and was stamped as\nreceived by DOHA on February 20, 2007.  That means his answer would have been received more\nthan a year after the date of the SOR.  Although the letter transmitting the SOR to Applicant was\nsimilarly dated January 27, 2006, Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of receipt on that letter was dated\nFebruary 1, 2007, and DOHA stamped this letter and acknowledgment as being received by DOHA\non February 5, 2007.  Department Counsel did not file a reply to Applicant\u2019s appeal and there is no\nexplanation as to why it would have taken over a year for Applicant to receive the SOR.  \n Given the disparity in the dates between the SOR and the answer, and the fact that the SOR\nwas issued close to the beginning of the year, Applicant\u2019s assertions may have merit.  However,\nbecause of the present state of the record, the Board is not in a position to resolve the issue.\nAccordingly, the case is remanded to the Judge.

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 7, 2006, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was dated before September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that\nthis case proceed under the former guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2007, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of\nthe government\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on July 17, 2007.  Applicant was\nafforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by August 16, 2007.  He filed a response which was received by DOHA on August 11,\n2007.  The case was assigned to me on August 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.

When questioned about the incident,\nhe stated that the act was consensual.   On both the SF 86 and the e-QIP, questions about  UCMJ\n10\nproceedings required Applicant to list incidents for the past 7 years.   He did so.\n11\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n12\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates]\n13\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether\nApplicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006). \n5\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.   The\n12\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).13\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nE2.A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying  include:\nE2.A5.1.2.1. Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers,\nneighbors, and other acquaintances;\nE2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material\nmatters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\nrepresentative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination; and\nE2.A5.1.2.4. Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible\nto blackmail;\nApplicant was not required to list the 1992 non-judicial punishment because it does not  fall\nwithin the seven year time period requested on both the SF 86 and the e-QIP concerning his police\nrecord.  The government established its case under SOR subparagraph 1.b., because it is reliable,\nunfavorable information or increases his vulnerability because it would affect his community\nstanding.\nThe 2003 non-judicial punishment falls within the seven year time frame.  The misconduct\nis serious.  Applicant took advantage of the victim\u2019s intoxication.  Further, when first asked about\nthe incident, he lied to investigators and told them the act was consensual.  The government\nestablished its case under Guideline E as to this incident.\nE2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\nE2.A5.1.3.1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability;\nE2.A5.1.3.2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has\nsubsequently provided correct information voluntarily;\nE2.A5.1.3.3. The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts;\nE2.A5.1.3.4. Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or\ninadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and\nfully provided;\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n14\nId.\n15\nId.\n16\n7\nE2.A5.1.3.5. The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nE2.A5.1.3.6. A refusal to cooperate was based on advice from legal counsel or other officials that\nthe individual was not required to comply with security processing requirements and, upon being\nmade aware of the requirement, fully and truthfully provided the requested information; and\nE2.A5.1.3.7. Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased.\nAlthough the 1992 incident is old in time, it is not isolated because it is evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s proclivity to extramarital affairs, and is a pattern of rule violations of the UCMJ.  None\nof the mitigating conditions apply to the 2003 incident..  The conduct was recent.  It is a pattern of\nUCMJ violations.  There was no evidence that he sought or received counseling that indicates he will\nnot participate in these activities again.  Lying to the criminal investigators is not evidence of a\nresponsible or trustworthy individual.  Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases\nan individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in extramarital\nsexual activity, consensual and not, which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional,\nor community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.  I conclude Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n14\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n15\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (45),\n16\nhis education, his employment, and what might motivate him to be less than truthful.  Applicant\nsupplied false answers to criminal investigators.  This is problematic because candor with the\ngovernment about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person\ndiscloses the adverse information about himself, then he may be trusted with confidential or\nclassified information.  This case raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  The totality\nof the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the\ngovernment entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Blank Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 27, \n2004. On January 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing a security concern for Appellant based \non personal conduct under Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 1, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on February 9, 2007.  He admitted both allegations under Guideline \nE with explanation.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing.  Department counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 9, \n2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on July 17, 2007, \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand was provided the opportunity to file objections, and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant responded to the FORM \non August 11, 2007.  \n \nAn Administrative Judge issued an unfavorable security decision on August 31, \n2007.  Appellant appealed that decision noting that the date on the SOR was incorrect \nand the date should have been January 27, 2007 and not January 27, 2006.  if the \nactual date of the SOR was in 2007, the new adjudicative guidelines were in effect and \nthe decision should have been rendered using the new guidelines.  The DOHA Appeal \nBoard remanded the case to the Administrative Judge for a determination when the \nSOR was written and a decision based on the correct guidelines.  Since that \nAdministrative Judge is no longer assigned to DOHA, the case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 17, 2008. \n \nI ordered Department Counsel to present an affidavit from the official who signed \nthe SOR concerning the correct date of the SOR, and provide additional argument if \nappropriate.  The individual that signed the SOR provided an affidavit that the 2006 date \nwas in error and the SOR was in fact issued on January 27, 2007.  Department Counsel \nserved Applicant with a copy of the affidavit and Department Counsel\u2019s Reply to the \nOrder on February 5, 2008.  Applicant was provided an opportunity to comment and \nprovide additional information.  Applicant received the Department Counsel\u2019s reply to \nthe Order and Affidavit of the SOR signer on February 23, 2008.  As of March 24, 2008, \nApplicant has not provided additional information.  Based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the two factual allegations under Guideline E of the SOR, with \nexplanations. (Item 2)  I thoroughly reviewed the case file, record, and exhibits and \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old high school graduate who has worked for a defense \ncontractor as a supply technician since 2004.  He previously served over 22 years on \nactive duty with the Army in the area of supply.  He held a security clearance while on \nactive duty.  He has been married since 1984, and has three children. (Items 4 and 5, \nSecurity clearance applications) \n \nApplicant, while on active duty with the Army, received non-judicial punishment \nfor adultery in April 1992.  A fellow soldier complained that Applicant was having \nconsensual sexual intercourse with the soldier\u2019s wife.  The woman admitted the sexual \nintercourse which took place over a two month period from November 1991 to January \n1992.  Applicant was reduced in grade and required to forfeit pay. (Item 8, \nCommander\u2019s report of disciplinary action, dated April 13, 1992) \n \nApplicant again received non-judicial punishment, while on active duty in the \nArmy, for sodomy and making a false official statement in October 2003.  While \n\n \n3 \n \n \nstationed in Honduras, Applicant assisted an intoxicated female soldier to her room.  He \nperformed cunnilingus on her even though she claims she asked Applicant to stop.  \nApplicant claimed the sexual act was consensual.  The false official statement was \nbased on Applicant\u2019s statement that the act was consensual.  Applicant received a letter \nof reprimand, was restricted to his base, and forfeited two-thirds of his pay for two \nmonths.  Applicant included this offense on his security clearance application. (Item 6, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice Report; Item 8, Record of Proceeding \nunder Article 15, UCMJ, dated October 14, 2003, and Report of Investigation, dated \nOctober 7, 2003) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Applicant\u2019s conduct consisting of extra marital sexual acts and \nlying about one of them raise security concerns.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nConditions AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is \nnot limited to consideration of:  (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include \nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or other government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rules \nviolations: (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or the employer\u2019s time or \nresources); and AG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about \none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, . . .) \napply.  The records of non-judicial punishment are credible adverse information and are \nadmitted by Applicant.  His actions, particularly the false official statement, raise issues \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  These characteristics show the individual may not protect \nclassified information.   \n \n \nI have considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 17(c) (the \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); AG \u00b6 17(d) (the \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur); AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress); and AG \u00b6 17(f) \n(the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability).  I \ndetermine that none of these mitigating conditions apply.  The actions are substantiated \nby records of the non-judicial punishments and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  Adultery, false \nofficial statement and sodomy are not minor offenses, but serious offenses against law \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand military discipline.  Even though the adultery happened 16 year ago, the false \nofficial statement and sodomy happened within the last five years showing a pattern of \ninappropriate conduct of sexual activity and a false statement.  Applicant\u2019s adultery was \na falsification to his wife and his statements the sodomy was consensual was false.  \nThey cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant acknowledges his \nactions but does not appear to acknowledge the behavior was wrong.  Applicant has not \nshown that he sought counseling for his actions or changed his behavior.  I find against \nApplicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was involved in extra-\nmarital sexual activity.  He lied about one of the actions being consensual placing the \nblame on the other person.  He has shown that he will not follow rules and regulations \nand that he will lie about events for his own benefit.  Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

LOUGHRAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal government contractor. Applicant was born\nin the United States while her parents were in this country from Iran, furthering their education.\nApplicant\u2019s parents took her to Iran in 1984, where she lived until she returned to the U.S. in 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. Her mother and sister are citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant\nvoted in Iranian elections in 1998, because she believed she would be denied entrance to college if\nshe did not. Applicant possesses a valid current Iranian passport, because it is the only way she can\nenter Iran to visit her mother and sister. Applicant has not mitigated the foreign preference and\nforeign influence concerns. Eligibility is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. As required by Department of Defense (DoD)\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation),\nand DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January\n29, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 26, 2007, and elected to have the case decided\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel, in accordance with \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the\nDirective, requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 11, 2007. A notice of hearing\nwas issued on April 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 7, 2007. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant\nor continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on May 14, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nThe Government offered two exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and\n2, and admitted without objection. The list of exhibits was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) XI.\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice be taken of the facts contained in HE\nX. The source documents for the facts are U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Iran, dated\nOctober 2006 (HE I); U.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet: Iran, dated April 3,\n2006 (HE II); U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iran, dated October 10, 2006 (HE III);\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy\nResponses, updated January 5, 2007 (HE IV); U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices - 2006: Iran, dated March 6, 2007 (HE V); U.S. Department of State, Country\nReports on Terrorism, dated April 30, 2007, excerpts (HE VI); Statement of Director of Central\nIntelligence Agency, General Michael V.

I took administrative notice of the facts contained in\nHE I though IX, as substantially stated in HE X.\nApplicant testified and called two witnesses. She did not submit any documentary evidence.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nTr. at 23, 25, 29, 43; GE 1, 2.\n1\nTr. at 23-28, 32, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2.\n2\nTr. at 23, 40-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 5.\n3\nTr. at 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.\n4\nTr. at 23, 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; HE II.\n5\nTr. at 33, 39-41, 45.\n6\n4\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal government contractor. She has worked for\nthe same employer since 2004. Applicant is a college graduate of a university in Iran, and has a\nMaster of Science degree from an American university. She is single, with no children.1\nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of Iran. Her father passed away in\n2004. Applicant\u2019s parents came to the United States before she was born to further their education.\nApplicant was born in the U.S. in 1979, and is therefore a U.S. citizen. Since her parents are Iranian,\nshe is also an Iranian citizen. Applicant\u2019s parents returned with her to Iran in about 1984. Applicant\u2019s\nsister was born in Iran, and is not a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s mother is a college professor and her\nsister is a student. Applicant lived in Iran from 1984, until she returned to the U.S. in 2002.\nApplicant visited Iran in 2003, and twice in 2004. Her second trip in 2004, was to attend her father\u2019s\nfuneral.  \n2\nApplicant inherited approximately $50,000 to $80,000 from her father\u2019s estate. She has\nreceived about $10,000 thus far. Applicant expects to receive about another $20,000 from the estate.\nApplicant owns her house in the United States, and has about $20,000 in savings.3\nApplicant voted in an Iranian election in about 1998. She voted before she was accepted into\ncollege. Applicant was concerned that if she did not vote that she would be denied entry into\ncollege.4\nApplicant possesses a valid current Iranian passport. It was issued in about 2000, and expires\nin about 2010. She used her Iranian passport to enter Iran on her trip in 2003, and on her two trips\nin 2004. Since Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, she cannot travel to Iran on her U.S.\npassport. Applicant\u2019s mother and sister plan on immigrating to the United States. Applicant is\nunwilling to give up her passport as long as her mother and sister remain in Iran.  \n5\nApplicant speaks with her mother and sister via the telephone about every other day. They\nvisited her in the U.S. in 2006, and again in 2007. Applicant\u2019s mother brought Applicant\u2019s $10,000\ninheritance with her on one of the trips and gave it to Applicant. Applicant does not intend to ever\nreturn to Iran to live. She intends to remain in the U.S.6\n\nTr. at 46-55.\n7\nHE II at 1; HE V at 1; HE X at 2.\n8\nHE I at 7; HE IX at 20; HE X at 1-2.\n9\nHE I at 8; HE X at 2.\n10\nHE I at 8; HE IV at CRS-23-24; HE X at 2-4.\n11\nHE VI; HE IV at CRS-22; HE X at 3.\n12\nHE V; HE X at 5.\n13\n5\nCharacter witnesses on Applicant\u2019s behalf testified that she is an excellent person and\nemployee, and that she is very reliable and trustworthy. The witnesses recommended Applicant for\nan ADP position.7\nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested in\na learned religious scholar.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980. The\n8\nPresident\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated that the United States \u201cmay face no greater\nchallenge from a single country than from Iran.\u201d9\nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD);\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism;\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and\n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record.  \n10\nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern.  \n11\nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\nIran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups.  \n12\nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the\nIranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, including\nof minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention, including\nprolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe restrictions on civil liberties - speech,\npress, assembly, association, movement and privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion;\nofficial corruption; violence and legal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and\nreligious minorities, and homosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n13\nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel\nto Iran. The children of Iranian citizens are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since\n\nHE II; HE III; HE X at 5-6.\n14\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n15\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n16\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n17\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n18\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n19\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd.

As a result, U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained\nand harassed by the Iranian government.  \n14\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any determination may be made.15\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n16\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n17\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed by a memorandum from the Deputy\n18\nUndersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 2004, to apply\nthe due process provisions of the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II,\nand including ADP III positions. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026 assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The\n19\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less\n20\nthan a preponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to\n21\nan applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case\nagainst him or her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n22\nfavorable clearance decision.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n23\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n24\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n25\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n26\n7\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether\n24\nan applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of\nprotecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\n25\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for\n26\naccess to sensitive positions.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each determination must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)\n(exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport; . . . (7) voting in a foreign election) applies in this case. Applicant\npossesses a valid current Iranian passport, and voted in Iranian elections while a U.S. citizen.\nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC), and I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry), FP MC 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship), and\nFP MC 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before\nthe individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor). Applicant was a minor\nwhen her parents returned to Iran. She had no choice in where she lived when she was a minor, but\nshe actively exercised her dual citizenship while an adult by voting in Iranian elections, and by\n\nISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); HE III at 1.\n27\n8\nobtaining and using an Iranian passport. I do not find FP MC 11(a) totally applicable because she\nactively exercised her dual citizenship. Applicant may be willing to give up her Iranian passport and\nrenounce her dual citizenship in the future, if her mother and sister immigrate to the United States.\nFP MC 11(b) does not apply because Applicant has not expressed a current willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship. FP MC 11(c) is not applicable because she voted and used an Iranian passport while\nan adult.\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties\nor foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. This raises a security concern under the foreign influence guideline.\nAdjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which\nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations\nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI considered Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and FI DC 7(e) (a substantial business, financial,\nor property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business,\nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation). Iran is a\ncountry that is clearly hostile to the United States.  It is considered the most active state sponsor of\n27\nterrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against\nits people. Applicant\u2019s immediate family in Iran creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant expects to receive about $20,000 from\nher father\u2019s estate in Iran. That is a substantial financial interest in a foreign country, which could\nsubject Applicant to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. FI DC 7(a) and FI DC 7(e)\nare applicable. \nI considered all the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC), and especially FI MC\n8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely that\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), FI MC 8(b) (there is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, organization, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest), and FI MC 8(f) (the value or routine\nnature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result\nin a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual).\n\n9\nBecause of Iran\u2019s hostility to the U.S., support for terrorism, and willingness to subject their\ncitizens to human rights abuses, I find FI MC 8(a) does not apply. Applicant remains extremely close\nto her mother and sister. While I do not doubt her sincerity, and I found her testimony credible,\nApplicant has not convinced me that I should find FI MC 8(b) totally applicable. Applicant expects\nto receive an additional $20,000 from her father\u2019s estate. That is a considerable sum, even when\nconsidering Applicant\u2019s U.S. assets. After hearing Applicant testify, and considering her character\nevidence, I am convinced that this money could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure her. FI MC 8(f) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.c.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant was born in this country while her parents were furthering their education. They\nreturned to Iran in about 1984, and Applicant lived there until she returned to the U.S. in 2002.\nApplicant voted in Iranian elections in about 1998, because she thought she might be denied\nacceptance into college if she did not. She possessed and used an Iranian passport because that is the\nonly way she can travel to Iran to visit her family. I found Applicant to be a credible witness, and I\nbelieve her witnesses that she is a reliable, trustworthy person. I do not believe her inheritance can\nbe used against her by the government of Iran. Her inheritance is only money. I cannot say the same\nthing regarding her family. As addressed above, Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, is clearly hostile\nto the U.S., and has a terrible human rights record. Applicant\u2019s family, which she clearly loves, makes\nher vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress from the Iranian government.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns based on foreign\npreference and foreign influence issues, and has not met her burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. Eligibility\nis denied.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT In the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a., through 1.f., under Guideline F. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that evidence, 3 I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 26 years old.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n  Applicant has a history of overdue debts. He has made no attempt to resolve these debts.\n\n2\nMitigation has not been shown. A determination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive\ninformation is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn March 19, 2007, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nIn a signed and sworn statement, notarized on May 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nSOR allegations (RSOR)and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn June 29, 2007, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing\nand issue a written decision,. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 20, 2007, and\nthe hearing was conducted on September 11, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibits at the hearing but\noffered his own testimony and that of his mother. The record  held open until September 19, 2007,\nto allow Applicant to offer additional documents. No documents were received by that date. The\ntranscript (Tr) was received on September 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive. The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a., through 1.f., under\nGuideline F. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nRSOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that evidence,\n\n3\nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is married, and he has one son.  Applicant is a customer Service\nRepresentative for a defense contractor who seeks an ADP-I/II/III position on behalf of the\nApplicant.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists six allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.f., under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. As stated above, Applicant\u2019s has admitted owing each of these debts under Guideline\nF, totaling approximately $17,000, and at the time of the hearing none of these debts had been\nresolved or even reduced. The debts will be listed in the same order as they were in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $564.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $114.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,576.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $350.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $292.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $14,943.\nApplicant conceded that he was aware of the concern of the Government with these overdue\ndebts, since he first received interrogatories regarding his finances in January 2007, and he became\neven more  aware of the concern after he received the SOR in March 2007, but he did not make any\nattempt to resolve any of these debts, even the smallest ones, and he failed to contact any of the\ncreditors. Applicant stated that he believed all of the debts had to resolved all at once, which he was\nnot able to do, so he took no action.  \nWhen Applicant\u2019s  mother testified, she stated that she had been advising her son ,for some\ntime, to consult a credit counselor to see if Applicant could get help in resolving his overdue debts.\nApplicant could give no valid explanation as to why he had failed to follow his mother\u2019s advice. \nApplicant did explain that debt 1.f., which is clearly the largest debt, arose as a result of his\nfather having Applicant cosign a loan for a vehicle for his father. When Applicant\u2019s father failed to\nmake payments on the vehicle, it was repossessed. Since Applicant\u2019s father then filed for bankruptcy,\nApplicant was responsible for the entire debt.   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\n\n4\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline F, which establishes doubt about a\nperson's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be\nshown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his suitability for a sensitive Systems Position,\nwith respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not\nrequired.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant is presently qualifies for a sensitive Systems Position.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guideline F: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts or even made an attempt.\nApplicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial\n\n5\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (DC) 19. (a), and DC 19. (c), a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. While Mitigating Condition\n(MC) 20. (b) could be argued to apply, because the largest part of Applicant\u2019s debt arose through the\nactions of his father, Applicant has failed to take any action to attempt to resolve this overdue debt,\nthus failing to act responsibly, so this Mitigating Condition does not apply in this case. I do not find\nthat any other Mitigating Condition is applicable to this case. \nUntil Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and he can establish a record\nof financial responsibility and stability, concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve\nGuideline F against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against   Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and\neligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nMartin H.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline M, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant misused government resources while employed from 2002 to 2004 during work and non-work hours by using his computer to access inappropriate web sites, to include those of a pornographic nature. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the government alleged Applicant installed software that could erase system memory on his computer from 2002 to 2004. In SOR \u00b6 1.c., the government alleged Applicant sent a joke from a pornographic web site in 2004 to a co- worker. Under Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a the same information alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The government also alleged falsification in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. through d. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old. Since April 2004, he has worked as a systems analyst for a defense contractor. In 2003, he graduated from college with a B.S. degree. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1996 until 2002, and held a security clearance. He also held a clearance during his civilian employment until his resignation in 2004 (Item 4).

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On July 31, 2008, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline M (misuse of\n2\ninformation technology) and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nOctober 31, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted eleven items to support its case.\n3\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and admitted all of the allegations in the\nSOR. He elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 29, 2008.3\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 12, 2008,\nand was provided an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional\ninformation on September 22, 2008. The case was assigned to me on October 21,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline M, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant misused\ngovernment resources while employed from 2002 to 2004 during work and non-work\nhours by using his computer to access inappropriate web sites, to include those of a\npornographic nature. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the government alleged Applicant installed software\nthat could erase system memory on his computer from 2002 to 2004. In SOR \u00b6 1.c., the\ngovernment alleged Applicant sent a joke from a pornographic web site in 2004 to a co-\nworker. \nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a the same information\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The government also alleged falsification in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. through\nd. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 54 years old. Since April 2004, he has worked as a systems analyst\nfor a defense contractor. In 2003, he graduated from college with a B.S. degree.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1996 until 2002, and held a security clearance.\nHe also held a clearance during his civilian employment until his resignation in 2004\n(Item 4).\nApplicant worked as a civilian employee from 2002 until 2004. During that time,\nhe admits sending inappropriate email to a coworker. The email contained a photograph\nof a pornographic nature. An investigation revealed that he also installed software that\nhe could use to erase system memory. Applicant visited many sites on the internet\nduring work and non-work hours on his government computer that were considered\npornographic. He spent approximately two hours per day, on average, searching the\ninternet for these sites (Item 9). The record reveals that he was counseled at some point\nin time about the inappropriate use (Item 11).\nOn February 17, 2004, a complaint was filed against Applicant. An investigation\nfollowed and Applicant was sent back to work. However, his computer was taken.\nApplicant resigned his position on April 4, 2004 (Item10). \n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are: (1) the nature, extent, and\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n3\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2005. He\nanswered Section 22: Your Employment Record. His response to the question\nconcerning the reasons for resigning a job under unfavorable circumstances was \u201cno.\u201d\nApplicant explained that he did resign but he had reasons in addition to \u2018unfavorable\ncircumstances.\u2019 He claimed he was subject to weekly interrogations and saw no\npunishment in sight. He began to feel harassed (Applicant\u2019s answer to FORM, undated).\nA Department of Defense investigator interviewed Applicant on August 9, 2006\n(Item 5). He reported that he used the computer once to visit a pornographic web site.\nIn his answer, he admitted that he falsified material facts by not disclosing that he had\naccessed the pornographic sites on many occasions. He did not provide any information\nor explanation that would permit mitigation. \nApplicant teaches classes to graduates and undergraduates on post on the \u201cdos\nand don\u2019ts\u2019 of security issues. He wants to pass on the lesson that he has learned from\nhis mistake. He is also taking post graduate courses in information security. He is sorry\nfor his mistakes.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n5\nmitigating conditions is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under Guideline M (misuse of information technology systems), at\nAG \u00b6 39, and Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of\nthe government.8\nAnalysis\nMisuse of Information Technology Systems.\nUnder Guideline M, \u201c[n]oncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39). The government presented sufficient information\nto support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Applicant admitted using his\ncomputer at work to access inappropriate web sites, to include those of a pornographic\nnature. The information presented requires consideration of the disqualifying condition\nlisted at AG \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology\nsystem).\nThe record does support consideration of Guideline M mitigating conditions listed\nin AG \u00b6 41. This conduct last occurred in 2004. Since then, Applicant has taught\ngraduate and undergraduate classes on security for several years to share his\nknowledge and impart the lessons that he has learned from this experience. He is also\ntaking classes in information security for his benefit. He acknowledges his inappropriate\nactions and admits it was wrong. Applicant has demonstrated how his actions do not\nreflect adversely on his current \u201creliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6\n41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). \n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, available information requires consideration of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities). Applicant admitted that he initially denied any inappropriate\ncomputer activity during his interview in 2004 and in an August 9, 2006 interview with an\ninvestigator for DoD. On his November 1, 2005 security clearance application, he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Section 22: Your Employment Record and failed to disclose that he\nresigned from employment in 2004 following his investigation about the computer\nmisuse. For these reasons, the record does not warrant application of any of the\nmitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines M and E. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult who held a security clearance for many years. Since\n9\nthe 2004 resignation, Applicant has taught classes in security information and tried to\nimpart the lesson that he learned from his inappropriate use of his government\ncomputer. He acknowledges his mistake and is sorry for the incident. The positive\ninformation about Applicant is sufficient to overcome the adverse information about his\nconduct at his previous job under Guideline M. However, the falsification of information\nduring his investigations and on his November 2005 security application raise serious\ndoubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s recent conduct does not\nmitigate the security concerns under the personal conduct guideline. Because\nprotection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts\nmust be resolved in favor of the national interest.  \n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.

He completed several short-term drug\ntreatment programs, but after each his drug abuse recurred.  He voluntarily entered treatment in April\n2003, and he has abstained from illegal drugs since then, but he is dependent on methadone to\ncontrol his addiction.  He disclosed his illegal use of prescription drugs on his security clearance\napplication but neglected to disclose use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin.  He refuted the allegation\nof falsifying his security clearance application, but he has not mitigated the security concern based\non his drug involvement.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on August 30,\n2006 (Guidelines). The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 2, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007, and heard on\nMarch 13, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 49-year-old plant service worker for a defense contractor.  He has worked for\nhis current employer since March 1981.  He was married in March 1989 and has two children, ages\n16 and 13.  He has never held a clearance.\nIn 1972, when Applicant was in high school, he started smoking marijuana, and he continued\nusing marijuana until about 2001.  Some time in the 1970s, he became acquainted with a Vietnam\nveteran who had lost both legs and had a prescription for Lorcet and Dilaudin.  Applicant started\nobtaining prescription drugs from his friend until the friend died.  Applicant then found other persons\nwith prescriptions and obtained the drugs from them.  \nIn February 1976, Applicant was arrested for sexual assault and public indecency.  In July\n1976, he was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI).  In both cases, he was held in jail but the\nrecord does not reflect a conviction or sentence.  In December 1978, he was arrested for DUI, and was\nsentenced to probation for 12 months and fined $400.  In February 1984, he was arrested for DUI and\nfined $650.  In June 1984, he was arrested for attempting to elude a police officer, obstructing police,\nattempting to commit a misdemeanor, simple battery, criminal trespass, and a dangerous drug offense.\nHe was sentenced to probation for 12 months and a $400 fine.  In January 1986, he was arrested for\nDUI and fined $730.  Also in January 1986, he was arrested for reckless conduct, pointing a weapon\nat another, discharging a firearm near a public highway, and discharging a firearm on the property of\nanother.  He was fined $53, but it was suspended for six months.  These arrests and convictions are\nnot alleged in the SOR but are reflected on the criminal history submitted by Applicant at the hearing\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 2).\n\n4\nIn July 1986, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence, violating the state\ncontrolled substance laws, striking a fixed object, and driving without insurance (Government Exhibit\n2 at 3).  The record does not reflect a conviction or sentence.  This arrest is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.\nIn August 1986, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct.  He was\nsentenced to confinement for six months, with 90 days suspended, and five years of probation (GX 2\nat 3).  This offense was not alleged in the SOR.\nSome time in 1986, Applicant entered a rehabilitation program.  He stayed away from drugs\nfor about eight years. He was put on methadone maintenance for a brief period some time between\n1994 and 1997 (Tr. 64).  \nIn July 1995, Applicant was arrested for possession of a marijuana and driving with no proof\nof insurance (GX 2 at 3; Tr. 35).  This offense is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nIn November 1998, Applicant was arrested for DUI and sentenced to confinement for 90 days,\nprobation for 12 months, a fine of $1,225, and placed in a work release program.  This offense is not\nalleged in the SOR, but it is reflected in the criminal history submitted by Applicant (AX A at 3).\nIn about 2001, Applicant started using marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in addition to Lorcet and\nDilaudin.  He entered a rehabilitation program for about five days in 2001 (Tr. 36).  He resumed using\nvarious drugs until April 2003, when he voluntarily entered an outpatient drug abuse treatment facility,\nat the suggestion of his now-deceased sister, with whom he had used drugs (Tr. 24).  He was diagnosed\nwith polysubstance abuse and opiate dependence.  He was given methadone to keep him from craving\ndrugs.  He started out taking 30-milligram doses of methadone, and it was later increased to 60-\nmilligram doses (Tr. 38, 60).  His dosage eventually was reduced to 40 milligrams, but it was increased\nto 45 milligrams about a year ago (Tr. 40, 48).  About twice a month, he attends meetings for\nmethadone users, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous (Tr. 43-44).  He was recently diagnosed as diabetic\n(Tr. 38).  He meets about twice a year with a counselor and a doctor (Tr. 51).  He has not yet\ncompleted the drug rehabilitation program.\nApplicant is required to submit to random drug screening as part of his current rehabilitation\nprogram.  He admitted he failed the first drug test, and probably failed two or three tests before his\nmethadone dosage was adjusted (Tr. 40).\nIn November 2003, Applicant filed a grievance because he was passed over for promotion.  His\ngrievance was denied because he was not eligible for the promotion without a clearance (AX B).\nIn November 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance.  On his Questionnaire for\nNational Security Positions (SF 86), he responded to question 24(a), asking if he had illegally used any\ncontrolled substance or prescription drugs by disclosing his illegal use of two prescription drugs\n(Lorcet and Dilaudin), but he did not disclose his illegal use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin.  He\ntestified he did not know why he listed only Lorcet and Dilaudin, that he must have misunderstood the\nquestion, and that he did not intentionally fail to disclose information (Tr. 28).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s wife is aware of his drug addiction and treatment, but his children are not (Tr. 45).\nHis drug and alcohol counselor at work is aware of his circumstances, but he has not told his\nsupervisor about his addiction or treatment (Tr. 45-46).\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he will battle with drug addiction for the rest of\nhis life.  He is not proud of his methadone use, but it is the only way he can resist using illegal drugs\nand the only way he can continue to work and stay with his family (Tr. 64-65).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20,\n1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\nmeeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person\nconcept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each specific guideline, and the\nfactors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance\nis not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is\nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19,\n2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan,\n484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because\nit may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24.\nAny drug abuse may be disqualifying under this guideline.  Guidelines \u00b6 25(a).  Drug abuse\nis defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(b).  A disqualifying condition also may arise from a positive test\nfor illegal drug use or \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 25(b) and (c).  The\nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, establishes all three of these disqualifying conditions.\nA disqualifying condition also may arise from a \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence\u201d\nor an \u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized drug treatment program.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 25(d) and (e).  Applicant readily\nadmitted his drug dependence, but there is no evidence of the credentials of the person who diagnosed\nhim.  He made general references to a \u201ccounselor\u201d and referred to a \u201cdoctor,\u201d but no evidence of their\ncredentials was introduced.  I conclude these two disqualifying conditions are not fully established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nFinally, a disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cfailure to successfully complete a drug\ntreatment program prescribed by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 25(f).  Applicant\nsuccessfully completed several short-term drug treatment programs.  There is no evidence that any of\nthe earlier programs were \u201cprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d  He has not completed\nhis current program, in which he was self-referred.  This disqualifying condition is not established.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nA security concern based on drug involvement may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 26(a).  It may also be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as . . . an appropriate period of abstinence\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse between 1976 and 2003 certainly was not infrequent.  His last use of\nillegal drugs was around April 2003.  Determining whether it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d that it is\n\u201cunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d requires a careful evaluation of the record.  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of\n\n7\ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine\nwhether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a\nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \nApplicant produced evidence of multiple arrests, convictions, and other misconduct not alleged\nin the SOR.  He stated at the hearing that he presented the evidence because he wanted to make sure\nI had all the available evidence (Tr. 21).  The Appeal Board has held that conduct not alleged in the\nSOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant\nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).\nI have considered his evidence for the limited purpose of evaluating the extent, duration, and severity\nof his substance abuse, and to determine whether he is rehabilitated.  \nThe period of almost four years since Applicant\u2019s last drug abuse is \u201ca significant period of\ntime.\u201d  However, in the context of his lifelong pattern of drug and alcohol abuse, his previous\nattempts at rehabilitation, and previous significant periods of abstinence (up to eight years)\nfollowed by recurring drug abuse, and his current need for constant monitoring and increased\nmethadone dosages, I am not satisfied that his most recent period of abstinence is sufficient to\nshow reform or rehabilitation.  I conclude the mitigating conditions in Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and\n(b)(3) are not established.\nA security concern based on drug involvement also may be mitigated by evidence of\n\u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(d).  Before enrolling in his current\ntreatment program in 2003, Applicant completed several short-term programs, but each time his\ndrug abuse recurred.  He has not completed his current program, nor does he have a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not\nestablished.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 15.  The relevant\ndisqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6\n16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission on a security clearance application, standing alone, does not prove an\n\n8\napplicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd.\nNov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant admitted his answer to question 24(a) was incomplete. He could offer no explanation\nfor the omission other than the possibility that he misunderstood the question.  There was no plausible\nreason for him to intentionally omit some of the drugs he abused, because his disclosure of abusing\nprescription drugs was sufficient to trigger an inquiry.  He was very candid at the hearing, presenting\nevidence from state court records, obtained at his own expense, that revealed arrests, convictions, and\nmisconduct beyond what was alleged in the SOR and proved by Department Counsel.  He offered the\nevidence because he was he simply wanted to make sure that I had all the available evidence (Tr. 21).\nAt times during the hearing he was confused and unfocused.  I am satisfied that his incomplete answer\nto question 24(a) was the product of that same confusion, and was not intended to deceive.  I conclude\nthat no disqualifying conditions under this guideline were established, and I resolve SOR \u00b6 2 in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nMany of these factors were addressed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is paying the price for a lifetime of substance abuse.  He sincerely wants to be free\nof his addiction.  He has not disclosed it to his children or his supervisor, making him vulnerable to\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  His lifelong pattern of treatment, abstinence, and\nrecurrence of drug abuse, coupled with his present dependence on methadone and the recent increase\nin his methadone dosage make continuation or recurrence of drug abuse likely.  This is a sad case of\nan honest and sincere man who is a prisoner of his drug addiction.  While he deserves compassion,\nsuitability for a security clearance cannot be based on compassion.\nApplicant has refuted the allegation of intentional falsification under Guideline E.  However,\nafter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the\nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns based on his drug involvement.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H (Drug Involvement):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR contains 13 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations, one allegation under AG K, Handling Protected Information, and one allegation under AG E, Personal Conduct. Applicant admitted three allegations under AG F (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.m). He denied the remaining AG F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i. 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l). He admitted the AG K allegation (\u00b6 2.a) and the AG E allegation (\u00b6 3.a). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Answer to Amended SOR.) Applicant is 49 years old and a college graduate. He has been married to his wife for 24 years. In 1984, the same year he and his wife were married, Applicant enlisted in the military. He served in the U.S. military until 2004, when he retired honorably. Applicant has held a security clearance for more than 20 years. (Ex. 1; Tr. 83, 91-93, 128.) Applicant and his wife are the parents of two children, ages 20 and 16. Applicant\u2019s second child, a son, was born prematurely and has experienced 3 developmental delays and difficulties. About one year after the birth of their son in 1992, Applicant\u2019s wife gave birth to an infant daughter, who was stillborn. (Ex. 1; Tr. 48- 51, 65-66.)

MacKinnon, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, and Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct. His eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant signed his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on August 20, 2004. \nOn that date, he also signed a release, which he then countersigned on June 29, 2006.  \nOn November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nDecember 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn December 29, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA served Applicant with an undated  \nand amended SOR, which, in addition to the previously alleged Guideline F security \nconcerns, also contained one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline K, \nHandling Protected Information, and one allegation under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. Applicant answered the amended SOR on June 22, 2008 and July 30, 2008.  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 16, 2008.  I set a hearing for October 6, \n2008, which was continued, for good cause shown, at the request of Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel. I convened a hearing on December 3, 2008 to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced nine exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 9 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified \non his own behalf and called one witness. He introduced 62 exhibits, which were \nidentified and marked as follows: Ex. A (Answer to SOR); Ex. B (Answer to SOR); Ex. C \n(Answer to SOR) Ex. D (Answer to SOR); Ex. E (Answer to SOR); Ex. A (Answer to \nAmended SOR); Ex. B (Answer to Amended SOR); Ex. C (Answer to Amended SOR); \nEx. A, 1 through 37; Ex. B, 1 and 2; Ex. C, 1 through 10, Ex. D, 1 and 2; and Ex. E, 1 \nthrough 3. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nDecember 15, 2008, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the \nrecord. Applicant timely filed six additional exhibits. Department Counsel did not object \nto Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. I marked the post-hearing submissions as Ex. \nF through K, and they were admitted to the record. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on December 11, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe amended SOR contains 13 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations, one allegation under AG K, Handling Protected Information, \nand one allegation under AG E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant admitted three allegations \nunder AG F (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.m).  He denied the remaining AG F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i. 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l). He admitted the AG K allegation (\u00b6 2.a) and \nthe AG E allegation (\u00b6 3.a). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. \n(Answer to SOR; Answer to Amended SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and a college graduate. He has been married to his wife \nfor 24 years.  In 1984, the same year he and his wife were married, Applicant enlisted in \nthe military. He served in the U.S. military until 2004, when he retired honorably.  \nApplicant has held a security clearance for more than 20 years. (Ex. 1; Tr. 83, 91-93, \n128.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife are the parents of two children, ages 20 and 16.  \nApplicant\u2019s second child, a son, was born prematurely and has experienced \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndevelopmental delays and difficulties.  About one year after the birth of their son in \n1992, Applicant\u2019s wife gave birth to an infant daughter, who was stillborn.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 48-\n51, 65-66.) \n \n \nDuring his Navy career, Applicant served as a radioman. When he was deployed, \nhis wife was responsible for paying bills and managing the family\u2019s finances. Applicant\u2019s \nson had poor health as a young child, requiring his wife\u2019s full-time attention.  During this \ntime, she was unable to carry out full-time work outside the home.  (Tr. 59-60, 92.) \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was stationed in a Middle Eastern country, where he served \nuntil 2003. His family was scheduled to accompany him to this duty station.  Applicant \nacquired a rental property for himself and his family.  However, Applicant\u2019s son was not \nmedically screened to reside abroad because of his health issues. As a result, \nApplicant\u2019s wife and children remained in the United States while he was stationed \noverseas, and Applicant maintained two households for a period of time. (Tr. 57-59, 68.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife sometimes had difficulty managing the family\u2019s finances.  \nSometimes, she fell behind in paying debts. When Applicant and his wife sought \nfinancial counseling, a financial counselor advised them to use their resources to pay \ncurrent debts because old debts, if unpaid, would eventually fall off their credit report \nand would no longer be a cause for concern. They followed this advice. (Tr. 60-61, 127-\n128.)  \n \n \nSince his retirement from the Navy in 2004, Applicant has been employed by a \nfederal contractor. His wife has also worked full time since 2004. Their combined net \nmonthly incomes, including Applicant\u2019s military retirement pay, total $7,747.  Their fixed \nmonthly expenses total $4,389. Their monthly net remainder totals $3,253.  (Tr. 74; 154-\n158; Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J.)   \n \n \nIn his current civilian employment, Applicant works in secure guarded building.  \nHe works in a secure office and must present a badge to enter the office. He is also \ncleared to enter and work in other secured areas and must use a special code to access \nhis assigned secure computer, which has a classified removable hard drive.  He is \nrequired to remove the hard drive at the end of the work day for storage in a secure \narea. Each day, when the office is closed for the night, the last person to leave the \npremises is charged with preparing a checklist certifying that all classified materials are \nappropriately secured. (Tr. 129-132.) \n \n \nIn March 2008, when Applicant left his office for the day, he did not remove his \nclassified hard drive from his computer and secure it as required. The individual \ncharged with the final security check of the office did not notice that Applicant\u2019s \nclassified hard drive had not been removed and stored appropriately. It was not until the \nnext day that it was discovered that Applicant\u2019s classified hard drive had not been \nsecured according to office policies.  (Tr. 132-135.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to properly secure the classified hard drive was reported to \nresponsible authorities, and he was suspended for one week without pay.  This was \nApplicant\u2019s first security infraction. The policy of Applicant\u2019s employer policies was to \nissue a letter of warning for first-time security infractions and to counsel the employee. \nAfter an internal investigation, it was determined that \u201cthe likelihood of a compromise of \nNational Security Information was not a threat.\u201d (Tr. 135-136; Ex. 9; Ex. D-1; Ex. D-2.) \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleged under Guideline K that Applicant\u2019s failure to secure \nthe classified hard drive violated paragraphs 5-100, 5-300, 5-302 and/or 5-303 of DoD \n5220.22M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, February 28, 2006 \n(\u201cNISPOM\u201d).  The amended SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure to secure the \nclassified hard drive also raised security concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand willingness to comply with rules and regulations under Guideline E.  (Amended \nSOR \u00b6 2.a; Amended SOR \u00b6 3.a.)      \n \n \nThe amended SOR also alleged Applicant was responsible for 13 financial \ndelinquencies. At his hearing and in post-hearing submissions, Applicant provided \ndocumentation to corroborate his statements that he had satisfied the debts alleged at \namended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.j, and 1.l. (Tr. 113-117, 122-124 144-145, \nAmended SOR Ex. A; Ex. C-5; Ex. C-6, Ex.3; Ex. G; Ex. F-2; Ex. F-8.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate his statements that he was \nmeeting payment plans for debts alleged at amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.m. \n(Tr. 118-121, 125-126, 147-152; Ex. C-7; Ex. F-2; Ex. C-8, C-9.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided documentation showing he had written to the three \nnational credit bureaus and formally disputed the debts alleged at amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.f. In his letter to the credit bureaus, he also requested their assistance in locating \nthe creditors identified at amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k so that he could contact them to \ndetermine the amount of his indebtedness. Applicant expressed a willingness to fully \nsatisfy all of his debts.  (Tr. 114-115, 119-122, 124-127, 145-146, 150-151; Ex. F at 1-\n2.)    \n \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s co-workers provided letters of character reference on his \nbehalf.  They praised him as diligent, responsible, and a hard worker. They identified \nhim as productive, dedicated to the mission of his office, and the \u201cgo-to-person\u201d sought \nout by co-workers and customers for his expertise.  (Ex. E-1; Ex. E-2; Ex. E-3.)  \n  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned a period of \nseveral years when Applicant was in the military and stationed unaccompanied \noverseas.  Applicant and his wife have been steadily employed since he retired from the \nmilitary in 2004. Their annual income, including his military pension, is approximately \n$93,000. \n \n Applicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had paid, settled, or  \nestablished active payment plans for nine of the debts alleged in the amended SOR. He \nalso provided documentation to show he had written to the three national credit bureaus \nto dispute the legitimacy of two debts alleged on the amended SOR and to request \nassistance in identifying two other creditors so that he could contact them regarding \npayment.    \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant and his wife sought financial counseling. Unfortunately, the financial \ncounselors advised them to ignore their old debt, advice which caused their financial \ndelinquencies to remain a security concern. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that \nthis had been bad advice. He admitted his financial delinquencies, and it was clear that \nhe understood his financial problems and had taken active steps to resolve them. I \nconclude that all of the Financial Consideration mitigating conditions apply to the facts \nof Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b633 describes the Guideline K security concern as follows: \u201cDeliberate or \nnegligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information. . . .\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to remove his classified hard drive from his computer and to \nsecure it properly raises surety concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 34 (b) and 34 (g).1   \n \n \nOne Guideline K mitigating condition might be applicable to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case.  AG \u00b6 35(a) reads as follows: \u201cso much time has elapsed since the \nbehavior, or it happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security infraction occurred in March 2008, and it is therefore recent.  \nHowever, the record reflects that prior to Applicant\u2019s action in March 2008, he had held \na security clearance for over 20 years without incident.  Applicant\u2019s co-workers noted he \nwas careful and diligent. His action did not result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.  It was a one-time event and, when viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s reputation \nfor care and diligence, is unlikely to recur.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 35(a) \napplies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nThe amended SOR concluded that Appellant\u2019s personal conduct related to his \nfailure to properly secure his classified hard drive at the end of the work day raised \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and ability to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.  Under the Personal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d  AG \u00b615. \n \n \n1 AG \u00b6 34(b) reads: \u201ccollecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or in any other \nunauthorized location.\u201d  AG \u00b6 34(g) reads: \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor other sensitive information.\u201d  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n I have considered all of the Personal Conduct disqualifying conditions.  \nAppellant was entrusted with a security clearance, which his employer relied upon in \nemploying him. He was responsible for following his employer\u2019s and the NISPOM\u2019s \npolicies for protecting classified information. I conclude that his failure to properly secure \nhis classified hard drive raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \n \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b617(c).   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s action in failing to properly secure his classified hard drive was not \nminor, and it was a recent act. However, it was his first and only security infraction in \nover 20 years of holding a security clearance. An investigation concluded that no \ncompromise of national security information had occurred as a result of his infraction. \nHe had a reputation in his office among his co-workers as diligent and responsible. It \ndoes not appear that this behavior is likely to recur.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n17(c)  applies to the facts of Appellant\u2019s case.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person of 49 \nyears. His financial problems began when he was a younger man serving in the military \nand frequently deployed. In his absence, his wife was responsible for handling the \nfamily\u2019s finances. She sometimes found it difficult to timely pay their creditors.  Since \n2004, both Applicant and his wife are employed full-time. Their annual family income is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nover $90,000 a year, and there appear to be no impediments to prevent them from \ntimely meeting all of their financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has shown good faith in contacting his creditors and paying or settling \nhis delinquent accounts. He has contacted the three national credit bureaus to dispute \ntwo accounts and to obtain additional information about two others. He is currently living \nwithin his means and paying attention to his financial obligations. \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at his security clearance hearing.  I found him to be \na serious and responsible person. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future he will \nfail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security \nclearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that he is not a \nsecurity risk at this time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Guideline \nK, and Guideline E. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m:          For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \n \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  2.a:  \n                    For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n                    For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2 of the Directive,\nwhich is pending revision to incorporate them. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant with the SOR.\n \n2\nApplicant is a 45-year-old owner and president of a small business defense contractor. He\nowes more than $1,000,000 in delinquent federal income and employer taxes, and owes more than\n$220,000 in other debts reduced to liens and judgments. He has made some partial repayments, but\nregularly experiences negative monthly cash flow and is unable to repay these debts. He also\nreceived more than 25 citations for traffic and parking violations and did not pay the fines when due.\nSecurity concerns raised by financial considerations and personal conduct were not mitigated.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on January 17, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as its president and CEO. On November 29, 2006, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The\nSOR detailed reasons, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary\n1\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\na security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated December 22, 2006,\nand a supplemental notarized letter dated January 29, 2007, admitting the truth of some of the\nallegations and denying others, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was then assigned to me on May 11, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 23, 2007,\nand the hearing was held as scheduled on June 21, 2007. On April 23, 2007, the Government\nsubmitted a motion to amend the SOR by reducing the amount of debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and\nserved a copy on Applicant. On June 5, 2007, the Government submitted a motion to amend the SOR\nby reducing the amount of debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and served a copy on Applicant. These motions\nwere granted at the hearing, without objection. The Government offered 23 exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 23, and admitted without objection. Applicant\ntestified, and offered four exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, and\nadmitted without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was left open until July 6, 2007, to\npermit him to submit additional documentary evidence. That evidence was timely received, via\nDepartment Counsel, who had no objection to its admission. This evidence was marked AE E\nthrough J, was also fully considered and admitted into the record. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr) on July 6, 2007.\n\nGE 1 (e-QIP, dated Jan. 17, 2006) at 6, 27-28; Tr at 53.  \n2\nSee also, GE 3 at 2 and GE 4 at 1; GE 6 through GE 11. Note: the Government did not allege the additional\n3\n$270,000 in more recently assessed tax debts identified in GE 10 and GE 11 (Notices of Federal Tax Liens dated Oct.\n30 and 31, 2006). \nTr at 54, 72-73; GE 7; GE 8; GE 9.\n4\nTr at 67-70.\n5\nGE 15 at 6-7, 8; GE 16.\n6\nTr at 29, 31-32, 73-74; Applicant\u2019s undated cover letter and AE E through J.\n7\nSee also, GE 15 at 9-10; GE 17; GE 18; GE 22.\n8\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of some factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nfinancial considerations under AG F (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.k), and personal conduct under AG\nE (\u00b6 2.a), noting unspecified extenuating circumstances. Those admissions are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegations under AG F (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h through 1.j,\nand 1.l through 1.z). After complete and thorough review of all the evidence in the record, and upon\ndue consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old president and CEO of a small-business defense contractor seeking\nto obtain a security clearance for the first time.  He is married with two children. Applicant admitted\n2\nto owing the IRS more than $1,000,000 in past-due income taxes and employer taxes from 2000\nthrough 2003 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.  He said that the majority of this debt arose from\n3\na failed transportation business venture. However, he also said he owned that business from 2003\nto 2005, while the SOR alleged IRS debts arose between 2000 and early 2003.  He claimed that he\n4\nis making payments under an informal agreement with the IRS, but produced no documentation to\ncorroborate his claim. He also said they were negotiating but had not reached an offer in\ncompromise. The $2,790 per month payments he claims to be making would not repay this debt for\nover 30 years, assuming no additional penalties or interest.   Applicant submitted no documentation\n5\nto corroborate his claims concerning these debts.\nApplicant denied currently owing the judgment debts, totaling about $27,450, alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. The Government established that judgments and liens did exist.  He said he had paid\n6\nboth judgments, and no longer owed either creditor any money.  He said he would provide\ndocumentation to show this within a week,  but did not do so. Every indication in the record is that\n7\nthese debts still exist. \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g.  These debts\n8\nare to two firms Applicant employed in connection with renovation of a historic building into\ncommercial and residential condominiums. The bank that was financing the project terminated\nApplicant\u2019s credit after these firms had done the work for which they now claim payment. He has\na written agreement with the judgment creditor holding the former debt to hold off execution of\njudgment so long as he pays them $5,000 per month on the remaining $145,000 debt at 12% interest.\n\nAE B; AE C; AE D; Tr at 74-75.\n9\nGE 15 at 1; GE 18.\n10\nGE 22; Tr at 32-37, 75.\n11\nTr at Tr at 32-33, 35-36, 83-84.\n12\nGE 15 at 1, 3-5; GE 19. This creditor is the collection agency to which a number of unpaid traffic and parking\n13\nfines were referred by various county and municipal courts on the fines alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o to 1.y.\nGE 15 at 1-3, 12-16.\n14\nSee also GE 1 at 29; GE 20.\n15\nTr at 38-39, 79-81; AE A through J.\n16\nGE 21; GE 23. See Tr at 49-50. The $69 alleged debt in SOR \u00b6 1.u is actually $60. GE 23 at 3.\n17\nGE 3 at 10. The amount was reduced to $133 in February 2007. GE 4 at 1. \n18\n4\nHe has been making these payments.  This creditor filed a mechanics\u2019 and materialmen\u2019s lien on the\n9\nproperty as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.   Applicant did not explain why he denied this allegation in his\n10\nresponse to the SOR. He has not made any payments on the latter debt of $46,750, but that creditor,\nwho also filed a lien, expects to be paid when Applicant finishes the project and sells some condos.11\nApplicant is negotiating for additional financing to finish the renovation project, but is currently\npaying for all project work out of his salary from his defense contracting business.12\n  Applicant and his wife did owe a $3,755 judgment debt that  was still outstanding as of\nMarch 7, 2006, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i.  Applicant denied this in his response to the SOR, and stated\nduring the hearing that he believed the allegation to be in error. The court records indicate the\njudgment was fully satisfied on April 7, 2006.  Applicant also denied the tax warrant judgment debt\n13\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, claimed at the hearing that it had been paid, and said he would provide a letter\ndocumenting this fact. Although he did not do so, the Government-cited evidence did not establish\nthat this debt existed as alleged.  Applicant admitted the $31,000 judgment debt to a former\n14\nemployee as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k.  He claimed at the hearing that he had reached an informal\n15\nagreement to pay $3,000 per month, starting late last year, but did not know the outstanding balance.\nHe provided nothing to document this status.16\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.y allege $1,766 in unpaid parking tickets and traffic fines from 2002\nthrough 2005 that were referred for collection. Applicant denied these allegations. The Government\nprovided no evidence to establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l or 1.m, but did provide court records documenting each\nof the remaining allegations.  Applicant claimed he accumulated his various tickets and fines and\n17\npaid them when necessary to obtain a new vehicle or driver\u2019s license. He did not document\nrepayment of the alleged fines. However, the collection agency to which each of these courts referred\nthe unpaid fines was the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, whose debt was satisfied in April 2006. The\nGovernment did provide sufficient evidence to support the $283 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.z,\nand Applicant did not explain his denial, or otherwise establish he does not owe it.18\n\nTr At 59-64.\n19\nGE 3; GE 4.\n20\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR at 2; GE 5; GE 12; GE 21; GE 23.\n21\nTr at 84-87.\n22\nTr at 44-49, 83-84.\n23\nAE J; Tr at 39-44.\n24\n5\nApplicant earns $6,200 per month in salary from his business. His wife does not work outside\ntheir home. They own some rental property which generates a negative monthly cash flow. Applicant\ndid not know his net worth, or his monthly expenses since his wife manages their family budget.\nThey continue to spend more than they earn each month for family expenses and costs of the\nbuilding renovation. Applicant said they purchased their home for about $400,000, paying $50,000\ndown, and estimated its current value at $500,000.  His CBRs reflect six mortgages and home equity\n19\nloans totaling $853,700, with aggregate monthly payments of $6,893, and $2,157 in monthly car loan\npayments.20\nApplicant commutes some 2.5 hours each way to and from his office each day, and uses\nmetered parking while working. Applicant admitted, and the Government documented, that he\nreceived at least 25 traffic violations and parking infractions since 2002.  He further admitted that\n21\nhe continues to receive moving and parking violations on a regular basis.  He chooses not to pay\n22\nthese fines when due, instead paying them only when necessary to obtain a new license.23\nApplicant submitted newspaper articles showing that he is a prominent figure in the small\ntown where he lives, even to the point of having been a founder of a local bank, and that his financial\nproblems are public knowledge there. He asserted that this shows he could not be subjected to\ncoercion or duress over his debts because they are not secrets he is trying to conceal.24\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the AG are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise\nsecurity concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns.\nApplicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke\nan individual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set\nforth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n25\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n26\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n27\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n28\n6\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n25\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n26\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n27\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n28\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n30\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nRegulation, Appendix 8, Guideline F \u00b6 18.\n31\n7\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n29\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n30\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\" so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\nunfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant\ndelinquent debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\u201d31\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC), and\nfind that FC DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply to Applicant\u2019s situation and raise security concerns. His\nsubstantial delinquent financial obligations total more than $1,235,000 and extend back at least\n\nThose debts that he originally contested have been reduced to final court judgments against him.\n32\n8\nseven years. He suffers a negative monthly cash flow and lost his credit financing for a real estate\nproject that will require  substantial additional investment before it yields any return. He is making\nsome payments toward some of his delinquent debts each month, but is incurring additional debt,\nand is not in position to significantly reduce his indebtedness for many years. He would willingly\nsatisfy his debts if he could, but he cannot. His three major unpaid creditors, including the IRS, have\nall filed liens against his property. No other FC DC applies. \n  \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) that might\napply to Applicant\u2019s inability to meet, and history of not meeting, his financial obligations. FC MC\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply since more than $1.2 million in delinquent debt\nhas still not been resolved, multiple debts over at least seven years were involved, and Applicant has\nnot yet established a significant pattern of financial responsibility on which to predict any\nunlikelihood of recurrence. \nFC MC 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d)\napplies to some degree. Applicant bought into two bad business opportunities and lost significant\nmoney. He claims to be paying down some delinquent debts, but his monthly income from his main\nbusiness is insufficient to meet monthly expenses. A large proportion of his delinquent debts\npredated either of those businesses, however, and were not explained. \nFC MC 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) was not established\nby Applicant. No counseling was demonstrated, and the clear indications are that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties are far from being resolved or under control. \nFC MC 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d) also does not apply to mitigate security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation. He showed that he is making regular payments toward one major delinquent debt, and\nclaimed without corroboration that he was making significant monthly payments toward two others.\nHis credibility on this point is not good, given his claimed $6,200 in monthly income, and over\n$9,000 in monthly mortgage and car payments. Even if he were making all payments as claimed, it\nwould be decades before his present delinquent debts were resolved.\nApplicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any of his past-due debts,  and no unexplained\n32\naffluence concerns were raised, so FC MC 20(e) and 20(f) have no bearing in this case.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\n\nRegulation, Appendix 8, Guideline E \u00b6 15.\n33\nThe dishonesty aspect of this conduct arises from the implied assertion that one has met the state\u2019s legal\n34\nrequirements to exercise the privilege of driving on its public roads and highways when operating a motor vehicle, and\nhoping not to get caught in violation when those requirements are not met.\n9\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d33\nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC), and find that\nPC DC 16(d) (\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\nand may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations\u201d)\napplies to Applicant\u2019s extensive record of traffic and parking infractions, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nApplicant admitted to numerous and frequent citations for moving and parking violations, including\ndriving without insurance, driving without a valid license, speeding, failure to obey traffic signals,\nand driving with expired license plates. He admitted he received more than 25 such traffic and\nparking citations from 2002 to 2005, as alleged. While these infractions do not rise to the level of\ncriminal conduct under Guideline J, and standing alone might not sufficiently support an adverse\ndetermination, they evince a lengthy and consistent pattern of dishonesty  and rule violations.\n34\nApplicant consistently placed his own desire to drive and park illegally over his obligation to respect\nand obey the state\u2019s traffic laws. His unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and\nquestionable judgment raise security concerns under this guideline that must be considered, together\nwith all available information, in a whole-person assessment of his trustworthiness and\nresponsibility. No other PC DC applies.\nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). PC MC 17(a)\nand PC MC 17(b) address security concerns arising from falsifications, omissions or refusal to\ncooperate with the security clearance process, which have no bearing since such conduct was not\nalleged against Applicant. \nPC MC 17(c) (\u201cthe offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply to\nApplicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant\u2019s pattern of frequent traffic and parking violations, followed by\nconsistent failures to pay the resulting fines in a timely manner, represent a repeated flaunting of\nlegal obligations that is not minor. This conduct was both recent and frequent, and continued even\nafter Applicant was put on notice that such conduct raised security concerns. There is no mitigating\nevidence to support any judgment that recurrence is unlikely. The conduct casts continuing doubt\non his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. \nPC MC 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors\nthat caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur\u201d) was not asserted by Applicant, and there is no evidence to support it.\n\n10\nPC MC 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d) does not mitigate the security concerns here.  Applicant\nargued that his citations were public knowledge, he was prominent in his community, and was not\nsubject to blackmail as a result. This does not demonstrate the type of rehabilitated behavior\ncontemplated by this PC MC, which is primarily intended to apply to mitigation of security concerns\nunder PC DC 16 (e), not PC DC 16(d).  \nPC MC 17(f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability\u201d) does not apply, since Applicant both admitted to these infractions and court records\ncorroborate they occured. PC MC 17(g)(\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity has\nceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations\u201d) would apply to\nmitigate any security concerns under PC DC 16(g), which were not alleged in this case, but has no\nmitigating effect on concerns raised under PC DC 16(d).\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. The nature, extent, and seriousness of both his delinquent\nindebtedness and pattern of driving and parking violations is substantial. He knowingly failed to pay\nmore than $1,000,000 in taxes to the very government from whom he seeks access to protected\ninformation, and consistently flaunted his state\u2019s traffic laws. The conduct involves multiple bad\ndebts and numerous infractions over the past seven years or more, and continues unabated. Applicant\nis a mature, educated adult business owner who offered no reason he should not be considered\naccountable for his voluntary actions. He offered no evidence of rehabilitation or other permanent\nbehavioral changes. In fact, he gave every indication that he would continue spending other people\u2019s\nmoney and violating laws he considers insignificant as long as he remains able to do so. The\nmotivation for this conduct appears to be a desire to appear prominent and affluent despite a lack of\nmeans to do so. Applicant\u2019s enormous indebtedness in relation to his income, looming liens and\nother threats to his only assets, when combined with his at-best casual attitude toward meeting his\nlegal obligations, create significant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation and duress. The\nevidence shows that continuation and recurrence of these problems is highly probable. Accordingly,\nI do not find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial considerations\nand personal conduct. It is not clearly in the interest of national security to grant him access to\nclassified material.\n\n11\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, GUIDELINE F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, GUIDELINE E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His\n\n2\nCanadian and Serbian passports have been destroyed.  He intends no future visits to Serbia as he has\nno immediate relatives there.  He will soon inherit an apartment in Serbia worth about $30,000.\nOnce he does, the Applicant intends to sell it.  Its value pales in comparison to his $3,000,000 net\nworth in the U.S.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 26, 2007.\nThe case was originally assigned to another Judge, but was reassigned to the undersigned on\nJune 18, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, and the case was heard on June 29,\n2007.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant,\nwho also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on July 12, 2007.  The\nissues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence\nmilitate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual\nbasis of most of the allegations, except for subparagraph 1.c. in that he no longer possesses a Serbian\npassport; subparagraph 1.f. in that he also used his U.S. passport on his visits to Serbia; and\nsubparagraph 2.a. in that his father-in-law is now deceased.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 58 years of age, has a Law Degree from an American\nUniversity, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the\nApplicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of the same, I make the following additional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant was born in the former Yugoslavia in 1948, emigrated to the U.S. by way of\nCanada, and became a naturalized American in 1991 (Government Exhibit (GX) 2).\n1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant has renounced both his Canadian and Serbian citizenship\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppX) D).  His Canadian and Serbian passports have been destroyed by his\nSecurity Manager (TR at page 21 line 7 to page 22 line 1, AppX A at pages 2 and 3, and AppX D).\n1.d.~1.f.  The Applicant traveled to Serbia six times from 1998~2004 to visit his mother and\nhis in-laws (TR at page 22 lines 2~25, and at page 28 lines 2~23).  When not accompanied by his\nchildren, he used both his American and Serbian passports (TR at page 22 lines 2~25).  When\naccompanied by his \u201ctwin boys,\u201d he used his Canadian passport; as did his sons, to avoid his sons\n\n4\npossible conscription into the Serbian armed forces (Id).  As the Applicant\u2019s mother and in-laws\nhave all died, he plans no further trips to Serbia (TR at page 28 lines 2~23).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is now deceased (TR at page 23 lines 1~6, and AppX A\nat page 5).\n2.b.  He will soon inherit an apartment in Serbia worth about $30,000 (TR at page 23 line 11\nto page 24 lines 3~25).  Once he does, the Applicant intends to sell it (Id).  Its value pales in\ncomparison to his $3,000,000 net worth in the U.S. (TR at page 24 line 22 to page 26 line 7, at page\n29 line 15 to page 30 line 4, and AppX C).\nAs the Applicant stands to inherit property in Serbia, I must also consider that country.  The\nnewly-formed Republic of Serbia (2006) is a parliamentary democracy with about 7.5 million\ninhabitants.  Serbia\u2019s human rights record varies.  The government generally respects the human\nrights of its citizens and continues efforts to address human rights violations; however, numerous\nproblems persist.  Anti-American sentiment tends to be highest surrounding the anniversary dates\nof the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\n\n5\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, maintained Canadian and Serbian passports.  The first\ndisqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there was an \"exercise\nof any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . .  This includes but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered, however, by the\nsecond and fifth mitigating conditions.  \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship,\u201d and \u201cthe passport has been destroyed . . .\u201d  Furthermore, the Applicant has not\nonly \u201cexpressed a willingness to renounce,\u201d but has renounced his Canadian and Serbian citizenship.\nThe Applicant has no immediate family members living in Serbia, and his $30,000\ninheritance interest, which is in probate, is only about 1% of his net worth in the U.S.  This property\ninterest is not substantial.  I find no disqualifying conditions applicable under Foreign Influence.\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  A colleague speaks most\nhighly of the Applicants dedication, trustworthiness and reliability (AppX A at page 4).  The totality\nof the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a\nfavorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d.  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B\nand C are found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\ne.   For the Applicant.\nf.

After her debts were discharged in bankruptcy, she accumulated more delinquent\ndebt which she has not paid, or explained how she accumulated the delinquent debt.  She did not list\ndebts over 180 days past due on her application even though she knew about the debts.  She has not\nmitigated security concerns for financial considerations and personal conduct.  Eligibility for a\nposition of public trust is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny an application for a position\nof public trust for Applicant.  The action was taken under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-\nR, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), issued\nby the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on\nSeptember 1, 2006.  The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant and she was aware that the\ncase would be adjudicated under those guidelines.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on\nJanuary 10, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 23, 2007,\nadmitting six and denying two of the factual allegations under Guideline F, and denying the factual\nallegation under Guideline E.  She elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu\nof a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 21, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on February 27, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  She did not provide any further information.  The case was assigned to me\non April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who submitted a Questionnaire\nfor Public Trust Position on December 26, 2005.   Subsequent investigation reveals that Applicant\n1\nhad a bankruptcy petition granted in 1996, and accumulated delinquent debt thereafter.2\nApplicant admitted, and credit reports confirm, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in\n1996.

Applicant admits, and credit reports\nconfirm, that an account of $4,529 for rent due a landlord was placed for collection in December\n2004.  Applicant admits, and credit reports confirm, that she had a debt for $3,430 charged off in\nNovember 2002, and placed for collection by Providian in November 2005.  Applicant admits, and\ncredit reports confirm, she has a debt of $7,017 for the balance due on a car repossessed in December\n2005.  Applicant admits, and credit reports confirm, she has an account for $433 with a cell phone\ncompany placed for collection in March 2006.  Applicant presented no information concerning\npayments made on any of these accounts.4\nApplicant denies a medical debt for $318 placed for collection in May 2004.  She stated she\nplans to inquire about the debt on her next visit to the doctor.   Applicant also denies a debt for $51\n5\nplaced for collection in November 2004.  She is not sure of the debt since she has not received\nnotification from the store or agency or an attempt to collect the debt.6\nApplicant noted that at one time she had a two-income household.  She claims her husband\nspent money outside household needs.   She and her husband separated and then divorced, and she\nhad to support the household on only her income.  Her apartment was burglarized and items stolen\nbefore she had renter\u2019s insurance.  She became homeless for a short time in 2004.  She stated she has\nevery intention of paying her delinquent debts, but due to her work and commuting schedule, she is\nunable to find a part-time job.   Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for Public Trust Position shows she had\n7\nalmost continuous employment from March 1998 to present.8\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 22(b) on her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position\nasking if she was now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation.  At the time,\nApplicant was more than 180 days delinquent on at least four debts.  In response to the SOR,\nApplicant stated her student loan was in deferment and she was in the process of switching from one\nloan company to another.  Her student loan is current and this is confirmed by credit reports.  Her\nstudent loan is not listed in the SOR as an eligibility concern.

The new Adjudicative Guidelines set forth eligibility for\npositions of public trust, and lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  Each eligibility decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in\nthe Directive and Regulation.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n11\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.12\nA person granted eligibility for a position of public trust enters into a special relationship with\nthe government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose individuals to whom it grants such eligibility.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility for\na position of public trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is\n13\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary\nof Defense have established for granting such eligibility.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for a position of public trust.14\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n15\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n16\n\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nGuideline E - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise eligibility concerns and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate eligibility concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts reported by credit reports and admitted by Applicant brings the\nmatter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a) Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, DC \u00b6 19(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending\nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt, DC \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and DC \u00b6 19(e) consistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative\ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.  Bankruptcy is a legal and\n\n6\npermissible means of resolving indebtedness.  However, the circumstances leading to the bankruptcy\nand an individual\u2019s financial actions after the bankruptcy must be examined to determine their\nsuitability and eligibility for a position of public trust.  Applicant provided no explanation how or why\neach delinquent debt was accumulated.  She accumulated debt because she was spending more than\nshe had the ability to pay.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nAppellant\u2019s answer to the SOR raises Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (MC)\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgement, and MC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.  Applicant\u2019s debts are current since she has not paid or resolved\nthem.  The debts became delinquent under normal circumstances in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and are\nstill delinquent.  She continued spend and accumulate delinquent debt despite her inability to meet her\nobligations.  Applicant raises the separation and divorce from her husband as a condition beyond her\ncontrol causing the financial issues.  However, other than raising the fact of the separation and divorce,\nshe does not connect how the condition caused the delinquent debts or resulted in her inability to\nminimally begin repayment plans.  The separation or divorce are conditions that she could not control,\nbut staying within the limits of her financial resources were within her control.  She had many years\nto begin repaying even the smallest debts and has not.  She does not raise any information to show she\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.  The mitigating conditions do not apply.\nI considered all of the other Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition, and determine none\napply.  Applicant did not present any information on any financial counseling she sought or received\nso MC \u00b6 20(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, does not apply.  Applicant presented\nno information concerning any attempt to repay any of the debts so MC \u00b620(d) the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, does not apply.  Applicant\nadmitted to the debts and took no action to pay or resolve them.  Applicant presented no information\nraising any other mitigating condition, so she has failed to carry her burden.  I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list on her public trust application all debts past due over 180 days brings\nthe matter under Personal Conduct DC \u00b6 16(a) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from the personal security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness. Some of Applicant\u2019s debts were in collection for two to three years before she\ncompleted the questionnaire.  She acknowledged the debts and was not making payments on them.\nI find based on all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s claim her divorce caused her financial\nhardship, that she was aware of her delinquent debts over 180 days past due.  Her false answer to the\nquestion was deliberate and misleading.  I find Applicant deliberately failed to provide correct\ninformation in response to question 22b on the public trust position application.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a position of public trust.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties\nfor Applicant.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 3, 2007.  She admitted SOR\n1\nsubparagraphs 1.f, 1.j, and 1.m, denied the remainder, and requested a hearing. I\nreceived the case assignment on December 6, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non January 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 29, 2008.\nMarch 24, 2008\n\nAll had serious ear, nose and throat problems as toddlers that required, among other things,  tonsilectomies,\n2\near tube insertions, and adenoid removal (Tr. 51).\nAmong other things, the dashboard fell off (Exhibit 4 at 4).\n3\n2\nDuring the hearing, I received six government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to allow her to submit additional documents. Within the time allotted, she\nsubmitted two additional exhibits. The government had no objections to their\nadmissibility, and I incorporated them into the record. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on February 14, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to a sensitive position is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old married woman with three children ages 11, 5, and 2.\nShe has a high school education. Since September 2005, she has worked for a health\ninsurance company as a claims analyst. According to her employer, she \u201cmeets quality\nstandards consistently\u201d (Exhibit 3 at 4).\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Applicant accrued 14 delinquent debts in the\napproximate amount of $23,800. Ten, totalling approximately $3,900 (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c through1.e, 1.g through 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n), are insurance\ncopayments incurred for her children\u2019s medical care  (Tr. 25-26, 44). She initially denied\n2\nthese bills. After the SOR\u2019s issuance, she contacted the hospital where her family had\nreceived medical treatment over the years. She discovered that the hospital had\nerroneously listed these bills in her 5-year old son\u2019s name instead of hers (Exhibit E). In\nearly 2008, after the hospital corrected the discrepancy, she arranged a payment plan\nconsisting of $50 monthly payments (Tr. 44). She has made one payment so far (Tr.\n25).\nApplicant owes $449 to the remaining medical creditor (SOR subparagraph 1.b).\nShe does not recognize the creditor. Recently, she attempted to ascertain whether she\nowed the debt to the hospital where her family had received medical treatment over the\nyears. The hospital had no record of this bill (Exhibit E).\nThe SOR alleges another medical delinquency (subparagraph 1.o). It does not\nidentify a specific creditor, and Applicant denied it.\nApplicant purchased a used car in May 2002 (Exhibit 3 at 4). Shortly thereafter,\nshe began experiencing an unusual amount of maintenance problems  (Tr. 21). She\n3\nthen returned it to the dealer who provided her with another car (Id.). It was Applicant\u2019s\nunderstanding that the car loan would remain the same. She drove the replacement for\ntwo years, making steady loan payments.\n\n3\nIn September 2004, Applicant was laid off, and was unemployed through August\n2005 (Exhibit 1 at 3). Because she was unable to afford car payments, she voluntarily\narranged for it to be repossessed (Tr. 33, Exhibit 3 at 3). The dealer then resold it,\nleaving an approximately $8,500 deficiency (Answer to SOR Subparagraph 2.j, Tr. 21). \nIn June 2006, the loan company of the car Applicant had returned to the dealer in\n2002 informed her that she owed $8,800 (SOR subparagraph 1.f, Exhibit 4 at 4).\nApplicant told the creditor about the 2002 transaction with the dealer, and asserted she\nhad no responsibility to pay for it. The creditor continued to contend that she owed the\ndebt. During a 2006 meeting with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM), Applicant said she was going to retain an attorney to resolve this\ndisputed account (Id.). There is no record evidence of her either retaining an attorney or\ntaking any other steps to resolve it.\nIn 1998, Applicant opened a credit card account with a department store. She\nused it to purchase children\u2019s clothing. It grew delinquent in approximately September\n2004 after she was laid off. By January 2007 she owed approximately $2,900. She then\narranged a payment plan consisting of $50 monthly payments. She made the first in\nFebruary 2007 (Exhibit 3 at 9). After approximately five months, she stopped making\npayments because she got behind on other bills (Tr.53).\nApplicant and her husband have been separated \u201coff and on\u201d (Tr. 55) for several\nyears. Currently, they have been apart for two months. His financial contribution to the\nfamily has been sporadic (Id.).\nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) in\nSeptember 2005. She answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 22 requiring her to list any\ndelinquencies 180 or more days overdue when the application was completed.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to sensitive information,\nthe administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n4\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, [or] trustworthiness . . . \u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s debts did not become delinquent until after she was laid off in 2004.\nShe arranged payment plans for the credit card, and nearly all of the medical bills. She\nalso arranged for her car to be voluntarily repossessed when she realized she would not\nbe able to afford payments. AG \u00b6 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly,\u201d applies.\nApplicant was unable to adhere to the credit card payment plan. Also, she has\nonly been making payments toward the satisfaction of the consolidated hospital\ndelinquency bill for one month, and has not developed a plan to satisfy the deficiency\nresulting from the 2004 voluntary repossession of her car. Consequently, it is too soon\nto ascertain whether her financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c ), \u201c. . . there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not\napply. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to get her finances under control does not diminish the\nsincerity of her efforts. Her ability to make further progress was hampered by the lack of\na consistent contribution from her husband. Therefore, although her efforts were\nunsuccessful, I conclude they were in good-faith. AG \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies.\nApplicant disputes SOR subparagraph 1.f relating to an alleged deficiency from a\nrepossession in 2002. She returned the vehicle to the dealer only after discovering\nmajor defects shortly after she purchased it. She reasonably believed that she was no\nlonger responsible for the loan payments on the lemon vehicle after she returned it to\n\n5\nthe dealer, and began making payments on the car she received in exchange.\nNevertheless, she did not provide any documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthis dispute, nor any evidence of actions to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not apply. \nThe government\u2019s allegation, listed in SOR subparagraph 1.o, that Applicant\nowes \u201ca medical provider\u201d $137, without identifying the creditor, is vague and\noverbroad. I conclude it does not generate a security concern. \nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability [and] trustworthiness . . .\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s SF 85P\nomissions raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that she was unaware of the debts listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c through1.e, 1.g through 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n is credible in light of\nthe creditor\u2019s admitted billing discrepancy. I conclude the omission of these debts do not\nconstitute falsifications.\nI conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation that she was unaware of the delinquency\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 1.b when she completed the SF 85P was credible in light of\nthe evidence she provided documenting her efforts at identifying it. She did not falsify\nSOR subparagraph 1.b.\nApplicant disputes the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f. Consequently, she\ndid not falsify the SF 85P by not listing it.\nThe government did not prove that Applicant\u2019s car note, as referenced in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.j, had been delinquent for 180 days when she arranged for the car\u2019s\nvoluntary repossession. I conclude that its omission from the SF 85P does not\nconstitute a falsification. \nApplicant\u2019s 11-month unemployment immediately preceded her stint with her\ncurrent employer. She completed the SF 85P within one week of being hired. Given her\ntestimony that she lost control of her debts during the layoff, it is not credible that she\nwould forget the credit card delinquency when completing the SF 85P. I conclude her\nomission of the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m constitutes a falsification,\nand that AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies without mitigation.\n\n6\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s falsification on her SF 85P was a one-time,\ntechnical violation of criminal law. It is not indicative of any broader propensity toward\ncriminal behavior. Consequently, she has mitigated the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by circumstances beyond her control.\nAlthough she has made sincere efforts to satisfy them, the overwhelming majority are\nstill outstanding, and I am not persuaded that she will be able to adhere to a long-term\ndebt repayment plan. \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability are further called into question by her\nfalsification of her SF 85P. Upon considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to a sensitive position must be denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for occupying a\nsensitive position.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLarry Schaffer, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant was arrested and charged with DWI in 1988, 1999, and 2005. He received a\nsuspended imposition of sentence on each occasion, and he remains on probation from the 2005\nDWI until about November 2007. He deliberately failed to disclose his 2005 DWI and related\nalcohol counseling when he signed a security-clearance application in January 2006. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nOctober 18, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct\n(falsification) and Guideline J for criminal conduct. Applicant timely replied to the SOR and\nrequested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005. The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  Both the\n2\nDirective and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The revised guidelines apply to this\ncase because the SOR is dated October 18, 2006. The applicability of the revised guidelines was\nmade a matter of record at the start of the hearing (R. 11). \nThe case was assigned to me January 24, 2007. Thereafter, on February 16, 2007, a notice\nof hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for March 7, 2007. The hearing took place as\nscheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript March 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admits the three driving while intoxicated offenses (DWI) that resulted in\nsuspended imposition of sentences, but he denies the allegations that he gave deliberately false\nanswers in response to two questions on a security-clearance application. I make the following\nfindings of fact set forth below in numbered paragraphs. \n\n The relevant  part of Question 23 asks \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related\n3\nto alcohol or drugs?\u201d\n3\n1.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old security officer for a company engaged in providing security\nservices for the government. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a state university in 1976. His first\nmarriage ended in divorce in about 1982. He married his current wife in 1993. His employment\nhistory includes the following: from 1994 to 2003 he worked as a project manager for a\ntransportation company; from 2003 to 2005 he worked as a truck driver; and in April 2005 he started\nworking as a security officer at an arsenal. He has worked for his current employer since September\n2005.\n2.\nIn January 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. The result of the charge was\na suspended imposition of sentence for one year. In this jurisdiction, a suspended imposition of\nsentence results in the defendant being placed on probation. If the defendant violates probation and\nfaces revocation, the judge may order any sentence within the full range of punishment for the crime\nconvicted. If the defendant successfully completes probation, no sentence is ever actually ordered.\nIn that case, there is no conviction. Here, it appears Applicant successfully completed the one-year\nperiod of probation. \n3.\nApplicant\u2019s second arrest for DWI took place in March 1999. The DWI charge resulted in\na suspended imposition of sentence for two years. He was also ordered to attend a substance abuse\ntraffic offenders program (SATOP), pay a fine and costs, and his driving privileges were revoked\nuntil August 1999.\n4.\nHe completed the SATOP in July 1999. He attended the first-level of the program, which is\nan offender education program consisting of a ten-hour education course in a group setting. It is\nstrictly a educational program and involves no counseling. Thereafter, he successfully completed the\ntwo-year period of probation in about June 2001.\n5.\nAbout four years later, Applicant started his first job as a security officer in April 2005. For\nthat employment, Applicant completed a security-clearance application on April 1, 2005 (Exhibit\nB). In response to Question 23d  about his police record, he admitted that he had been charged with\n3\nor convicted of an alcohol-related offense. He described an April 1999 \u201cadministrative alcohol\nsuspension\u201d and listed a local county court and the state where it took place. He did not disclose the\n1988 DWI. In April 2005, he was granted an interim security clearance, which he held until about\nwhen the SOR was issued (R. 42).  \n6.\nTwo months later on June 8, 2005, he was arrested for his third DWI (Exhibit 3). According\nto Applicant, he had backed into a ditch and was stuck when the police arrived at the scene (R. 126).\nHe was required to perform a field sobriety test. The police officer arrested Applicant, placed him\nin handcuffs, put him in the police car, and took him to the police station where he was held for at\nleast 45 minutes. When asked to submit to an alcohol test at the police station, he requested to speak\nwith a lawyer. He was released without taking the alcohol test and the police noted on the ticket that\nhe refused to do so (Exhibit 3). Based on the refusal, the state suspended or revoked Applicant\u2019s\ndriver\u2019s license. \n\n4\n7.\nIn the meantime, another company was taking over the contract to provide security at the\narsenal. Applicant was offered and accepted a job with the new company as a security officer\nworking in dispatch. To facilitate this change, in August 2005, the company submitted paperwork\nto have Applicant\u2019s interim security clearance converted or transferred (Exhibit 5). Applicant started\nworking for the new company, his current employer, in essentially the same job at the arsenal on or\nabout September 1, 2005. \n8.\nApplicant contested the suspension or revocation of his driver\u2019s license as allowed under\nstate law. By counsel, he filed an application for a hearing and an evidentiary hearing was held\nOctober 17, 2005 (Exhibit A). The court took the case under advisement and a decision would be\nissued at a later date. \n 9.\nConcerning the DWI charge, the initial arraignment took place July 16, 2005 (Exhibit 3).\nAfter a couple of continuances, the DWI charge was disposed of in November 2005 via a plea\nbargain in municipal court  that resulted in a suspended imposition of sentence for two years (Exhibit\n3 and Attorney\u2019s testimony). The probation in conjunction with the suspended imposition of sentence\nis scheduled to conclude in about November 2007. In addition, Applicant was ordered to attend the\nSATOP. \n10.\nOn November 11, 2005, Applicant met with the SATOP and completed a driver risk\ninventory (R. 76). Based on this screening process, it was determined that he would attend the\nweekend intervention program (WIP). Thereafter, during the weekend of December 16\u201318, 2005,\nApplicant attended the WIP at a local hotel where he was required to stay starting Friday evening\nand ending Sunday afternoon. Applicant participated in the WIP and successfully completed it.  \n11.\nThe WIP is for \u201crepeat offenders or \u2018high risk\u2019 first-time offenders using intensive education\nand counseling intervention methods throughout a marathon weekend (48 continuous hours) of\nstructured activities\u201d (Exhibit 6). According to the owner of the company that runs the SATOP, the\nWIP involves intensive group processes and includes minimal counseling (R. 79). It is not a normal\ncounseling situation with one-on-one counseling sessions, a treatment plan is not developed,\nprogress notes are not recorded, and follow-up sessions are not conducted (R. 79\u201380). The\ncounseling is done by qualified professional counselors in small groups of 10 to 12 people.\n12.\nAlso in December 2005, Applicant learned that it was necessary for him to submit another\nsecurity-clearance application. This happened when the company facility security officer (FSO)\ncalled the Defense Department to check on the status of Applicant\u2019s security clearance and was told\na case had not been opened. The FSO was told to have Applicant submit another  security-clearance\napplication to get the process moving (R. 44\u201345). As a result, another company employee met with\nApplicant and told him to complete an in-house, company worksheet (See Exhibit 4) that would be\nused to complete the official, electronic version of the security-clearance application. According to\nApplicant, he submitted his previous security-clearance application (Exhibit B). But the employee\nwas emphatic that she would only accept and use the in-house, company worksheet for completing\nthe electronic version of the security-clearance application (R. 26, 63). In addition, it was policy not\nto accept anything  more than 30 days old (R. 26\u201327). \n13.\nUsing the information provided by Applicant, the employee completed the electronic version\nof the security-clearance application (R. 27\u201328). Following her standard practice, she printed a\n\n The relevant part of Question 23 asks \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related\n4\nto alcohol or drugs?\u201d\n The specific language of this question is \u201cIn the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as\n5\nliquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d\n Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.1 (setting forth nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept).\n6\n5\ndisplay copy of the application for Applicant to review. She told him to review it carefully because\nit was going to be submitted to the government. After review, it was electronically submitted to the\ngovernment. A copy of the in-house, company worksheet is not available because it is her standard\npractice to give it to the employee or destroy it as it contains private, confidential information. \n14.\nExhibit 1 is the written version of Applicant\u2019s security-clearance application. As part of it,\nhe executed a signature form for the application on January 3, 2006.  When he signed the form, he\ncertified that his statements in the security-clearance application were true, complete, and correct to\nthe best of his knowledge and belief and were made in good faith. Also, he acknowledged that a\nknowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal law.\n15.\nConcerning his alcohol-related offenses, Applicant did not reveal his 1988 DWI and his 2005\nDWI when answering the relevant question. In response to Question 23d  about his police record,\n4\nhe admitted the 1999 DWI, although with more detailed information than in the April 2005 security-\nclearance application. In addition, in response to Question 25  about his use of alcohol, he denied\n5\nin the last seven years that his use of alcoholic beverages resulted in any alcohol-related treatment\nor counseling. \n16.\nOn January 17, 2006, the circuit court judge that heard Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license\nsuspension/revocation case issued a written decision (Exhibit A). The court determined that\nApplicant was not allowed by the police officer the right or opportunity to personally contact an\nattorney within the time allowed by law. Accordingly, the court set aside and held for naught the\nstate\u2019s decision suspending or revoking Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and directed the state to reinstate\nhis driving privileges. The court further determined that the revocation was to be held and adjudged\nvoid, null, and of no effect, and the state was directed to remove any indication of suspension or\nrevocation from Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s record. The news of the court\u2019s judgment was communicated\nto Applicant by his attorney by telephone and then in a follow-up letter, dated January 20, 2006\n(Exhibit A). \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access\n6\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd.

Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n7\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n8\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n9\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n10\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n11\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.12\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n13\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n14\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E addresses issues of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. In this regard, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material\nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security\nclearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and\nwillfully. An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\n\n7\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 23d and 25 in his\nJanuary 2006 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). Concerning Question 23d about his police\nrecord, Applicant contends he did not list his 1988 DWI because he was told when he completed his\nApril 2005 application (Exhibit B) that he only had to disclose information within the last seven\nyears. He contends he did not list his 2005 DWI because it had not yet occurred when he completed\nhis April 2005 application and he simply turned that document in for use in December 2005. He\ntestified that he \u201chad no reason to believe that anything had changed\u201d (R. 116), despite that he was\narrested for DWI in June 2005 and the matter was disposed of via the suspended imposition of\nsentence in November 2005. \nHis explanation for not disclosing the 2005 DWI in response to Question 23d is not credible.\nFirst, the employee responsible for processing applications was emphatic in her testimony. She\nwould not and did not accept Applicant\u2019s April 2005 application because it was out of date and not\non the in-house, company worksheet that she used for all individuals. Her testimony was consistent\nand credible. \nSecond, comparing Applicant\u2019s April 2005 application with his January 2006 application\nreveals significant differences in content. For example, the April 2005 application (Exhibit B)\ndescribes the 1999 DWI as the offense of administrative alcohol suspension and the action taken as\nsuspension. It mentions the name of the county court and the state, but without a city or zip code. In\ncontrast, the January 2006 application (Exhibit 1) describes the offense as driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol and the action taken was license suspension-reinstated-administrative. It\nmentions the name of the county court and provides the street address, city, county, state, and zip\ncode. If the April 2005 application had been used as the source document for the January 2006\napplication, it would follow that the information for the 1999 DWI would be the same. Instead, there\nare several differences.  \nThird, to believe Applicant when he said that he had no reason to believe that anything had\nchanged ignores the well-established chronology of events. When he  went through the process of\nsubmitting a second security-clearance application, his police record had recently changed. In June\n2005, he was  arrested and charged with a DWI offense. The initial arraignment for the DWI charge\nwas in July. He had begun the process of contesting the suspension/revocation of his driver\u2019s license,\nhe attended an  evidentiary hearing in October, and a decision from the circuit court was pending.\nHis DWI charge was disposed of via the suspended imposition of sentence in November, and he met\nwith SATOP as required by the court on or about November 11, 2005. All these events took place\nbefore Applicant was asked to submit a second security-clearance application in December 2005.\nGiven these facts, Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony that he had no reason to believe that anything had\nchanged is rejected as a fabrication. \nApplicant is also accused of falsifying his answer to Question 23d by omitting his 1988 DWI.\nBecause I concluded that Applicant falsified his answer to Question 23d when he deliberately failed\nto disclose the 2005 DWI and find against him in SOR \u00b6 1.a, it is unnecessary to address his\nomission of the 1988 DWI, which is also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n\n8\nConcerning Question 25 about alcohol-related treatment or counseling, Applicant contends\nhe answered this question in the negative because he did not consider what he went through as\ncounseling. It is factually correct that Applicant did not have any treatment due to his alcohol use.\nTherefore, a negative answer is correct on the treatment aspect of the question. \nBut the same cannot be said for the counseling aspect of the question. According to\ninformation from the state (Exhibit 6), the WIP involves counseling intervention methods. And\naccording to Applicant\u2019s own witness, the WIP involves minimal counseling in a small-group setting\nby qualified professional counselors. Based on these facts, Applicant received counseling when he\nparticipated in the WIP in November 2005, and his negative answer to Question 25 was factually\nincorrect. Moreover, it follows that since he deliberately omitted the 2005 DWI in response to\nQuestion 23d, he had to continue his falsehood when he answered Question 25, which meant\nomitting any information about the consequences of the DWI (to include his participation in the\nWIP). Accordingly, I conclude his negative answer to Question 25 was a deliberately false statement\nand find against him in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making\nfalse statements to the federal government during the security-clearance process is serious\nmisconduct, and it is not easily explained away, extenuated, or mitigated. \n2.\nThe Criminal Conduct Security Concern\nUnder Guideline J, criminal conduct is a concern because a history or pattern of criminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A history of illegal\nbehavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with\nregulations, practices, or procedures for safeguarding and handling classified information. \nHere, a criminal conduct concern is raised under Guideline J. First, the record shows that\nApplicant has been arrested and charged with DWI in 1988, 1999, 2005. All three incidents resulted\nin a suspended imposition of sentence, which under state law is not a conviction. These\ncircumstances establish a pattern of multiple offenses regardless of whether Applicant was formally\nconvicted. \nSecond, Applicant is serving probation until November 2007 per the suspended imposition\nof sentence for the 2005 DWI. His status as a probationer militates against a favorable decision. \n Third, the criminal conduct at issue also includes making a false statement within the\njurisdiction of a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 based on the falsification\nallegations. Because I concluded that two falsification allegations were substantiated, the criminal\nconduct concern under Guideline J is decided against Applicant as well. None of the mitigating\nconditions apply. \nIn conclusion, after weighing the favorable and unfavorable information, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Likewise, he did\nnot meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept, and my whole-\nperson analysis does not support approval of a clearance for Applicant. \n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Since emigrating to the U.S., Applicant has earned an\nengineering degree from a reputable American university, become a naturalized U.S. citizen, and\nestablished himself as a reliable and trusted engineer with a U.S. defense contractor.  Applicant\u2019s\nbirth father, maternal grandparents, and maternal aunt are citizens of the PRC, reside in the PRC, and\nare presumably close to Applicant despite his occasional contacts with them.  Each of his immediate\nfamily members remain in a position that could realistically make them vulnerable to coercion or\npressure that could implicate Applicant and compel him to make decisions about competing\nloyalties. Applicant fails to mitigate potential risks to undue foreign influence concerns caused by\nthe status of his father and other family members living in the PRC.   Applicant successfully refuted\nallegations that he falsified his security clearance application by omitting prior possession and use\nof a Chinese passport.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 3, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 20, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on May 14, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on June 5, 2007.  A hearing was\nconvened on June 5, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing,\nthe Government's case consisted of one exhibit; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including\n(himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on June 14, 2007.\nBesides its one exhibit, the Government requested administrative notice of seven documents:\nA U.S. Department of State Background Note on China (January 2007), a U.S. Department of State\nChina report, entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005; a U.S. House of\nRepresentatives Select Committee Report on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial\nConcerns with China (January 1999); a National Counterintelligence Center Report to Congress on\nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage (2005); a National Counterintelligence\nCenter Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage (2000); an\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) Report, entitled Intelligence Threat Handbook\n(Unclassified/For Official Use) (June 2004); and U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular\nAffairs Report, entitled Consular Affairs Information Sheet on China (September 2006).\nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named\nbackground reports addressing the geopolitical situation in China.  Administrative notice was\nextended to the documents themselves in accordance with the provisions of Rule 201 of F.R. Evi.\nAdministrative notice was accorded the documents themselves, but the notice did not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing China\u2019s current state.  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAfter Department Counsel completed her opening statement, Applicant moved to amend the\nSOR to eliminate Guideline E as a security consideration.  Applicant based his motion on\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s failure to raise a controverted fact issue in her opening statement regarding\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his prior possession and use of a Chinese passport in the security clearance\napplication he completed in December 2004.  Based on the Department Counsel\u2019s disclaiming any\nfactual disagreement over Applicant\u2019s pleading response (specifically, he admitted the omission but\nwithout any intent to falsify), Applicant claimed a pleading admission by the Government which had\nthe procedural effect of removing  any factual issue from the case.  After consideration of the\narguments of counsel, Applicant\u2019s motion was denied.  Applicant\u2019s renewed motion at the\nconclusion of the evidence was also denied.\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with a copy of the Form of Relevant Materials (FORM), which triggered Applicant\u2019s\nsupplemental response.  For demonstrated good cause, Department Counsel was afforded three days\nto supplement the record with a copy of the FORM.  Within the time permitted, Department Counsel\nfurnished a copy of the FORM.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a father, maternal grandparents, and a\nmaternal aunt who are citizens and residents of China and (b) to have traveled to China in June 2000.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have omitted (i) his possession of a Chinese passport (one\nhe possessed between 1996 and 2000, at least) and (ii) his use of his passport to travel to China in\n2000. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  He denied\nany intention to falsify his 2004 SF-86.  In explanation, Applicant claimed his parents separated in\n1995, and his mother (who became a U.S. citizen in 2001) was awarded full custody of Applicant\nby the Chinese courts.  Applicant claims to have had very limited contact with his birth father since\nimmigrating from China, and very distant relationships with his maternal grandparents and maternal\naunt.  He claims no financial responsibility towards their upkeep and well being and undivided\nloyalty to the U.S.  Applicant claims he has not traveled to China since his last trip in June 2000.\nAnd he claims his omission of his Chinese passport in his SF-86 was oversight, which he openly\nand fully explained when he was interviewed by OPM agents.  \nApplicant filed a supplemental response in June 2007.  His response provides a detailed\naccounting of his life\u2019s history and addresses the various disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nthe Directive and their application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 25-year old engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to obtain a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China (PRC) in 1981 to parents of Chinese\ndescent.  He attended schools in China and became fully acclimated to Chinese culture and society.\nHis parents legally separated in 1995, and his mother was granted full custody by a Chinese court\nthe same year. The court cited incompatibility as the basis of the divorce and awarded child support\nto Applicant\u2019s mother.  Control of household properties and savings was extended to Applicant\u2019s\nfather.    \nWhile working as a translator for an oil service company in the PRC, Applicant\u2019s mother (L)\nbecame acquainted with a D (a U.S. citizen by birth and a retired Air Force service member), who\nworked for the same company (OGET), both in China and in the U.S.  L was never involved in any\npolitics  or dissident movements while residing in the PRC (R.T., at 137-38).  L\u2019s parents own some\nfarm property that L could inherit when her grandparents expire (R.T., at 139).\nL moved to the U.S. to be with D in 1994, and they married the following year (R.T., at 52-\n53).  Applicant (who was 15 years of age at the time) joined his mother and stepfather in the U.S.\nin 1997 (R.T., at 55-56).  For the ensuing four years, Applicant attended a local high school in the\nU.S., and graduated in 2000 with an excellent grade point average (R.T., at 58).  \nThe company (OGET) that employed both L and D is wholly owned by the Chinese\ngovernment and is legally treated as an incorporated arm of the Chinese government (R.T., at 153-\n55).  Applicant\u2019s biological father (G) never served in the Chinese military or worked for intelligence\nservices.  Nor was G ever involved in any political or dissident movements or detained or imprisoned\nby the PRC government (R.T., at 144).  During his working years, G was an electrician for OGEA.\nHe has since retired from OGEA with an adequate pension.  Applicant described OGEA as a sister\ncompany of OGET and intertwined in some kind of company relationship (R.T., at 147-48).   Both\nOGEA and OGET are related to one another and inferentially owned by the PRC (R.T., at 156). \nIn 2001, L became a U.S. citizen.  Applicant applied for U.S. citizenship in 2002 and became\nU.S. citizen in June 2003 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 123-24).  He has never formally renounced his Chinese\ncitizenship and must be presumed to retain dual citizenship with the U.S. and China.\nSince emigrating to the U.S., Applicant has maintained occasional contacts with his\nbiological father.  He speaks to his father and maternal/paternal grandparents once or twice a year\nby telephone, but never discusses his work (R.T., at 106-09).  None of his grandparents have had any\nknown connections with the PRC government (R.T., at 135-36).\nApplicant traveled to China in 2000 to vacation following his high school graduation and to\nvisit his family.  He entered and exited the country using his Chinese passport (R.T., at 113-14, 125),\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nwhich his mother destroyed after he became a U.S. citizen (R.T., at 126).  While in China, he saw\nhis father, grandparents, and maternal aunt (R.T., at 132-33).  His trip to China in 2000 was his first\nreturn to his birth country since his emigration to the U.S. in 1997 (R.T., at 114), and he has not\nsince returned to China.  Nor has he been in contact with his maternal aunt since he saw her in 2000\n(R.T., at 110-11).\nCountry status of the PRC\nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to US persons and interests, the PRC maintains\na relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC has an authoritarian government\nunder the control of the Chinese Communist Party (see, U.S. Dept. of State, Background Note on\nChina (January 2007).   Geopolitically, the PRC and the U.S. have been rivals since the Cold War,\nwith particular disagreement over the status of Taiwan.  China has continued to resist what it\nconsiders to be superpower dominance by the U.S., despite improving economic relations.\n The PRC is known to use its intelligence services to gather information about the U.S. and\nto obtain advanced technologies (see Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) Report, entitled\nIntelligence Threat Handbook (Unclassified/For Official Use) (June 2004).  The PRC actively and\naggressively monitors international communications satellites from maintained intercept facilities,\nin addition to collecting information on U.S. military operations and exercises, both legal and illegal\n(see U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee Report on U.S. National Security and\nMilitary/Commercial Concerns with China (January 1999) .   Examples of PRC economic espionage\nare cited in the National Counterintelligence Center Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage (2005).  Most of the examples of illegally exported technology\nto the PRC involve high tech equipment and devices used in missile and aircraft guidance systems,\nhighly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras and missile microchips. \nEstablished in 1949, the PRC, with over 1.3 billion people, is the world\u2019s most populous\ncountry (see  U.S. Dept. of State, Background Note on China (January 2007).  Today it continues\nto undergo rapid economic and social change.  Political power, however,  remains centralized in the\nChinese Communist Party with little indication of any change in the foreseeable future.  To be sure,\nthe PRC has never been known for a positive human rights record among Western nations and\ninternational human rights groups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any\ncognizable tradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law (see  U.S.\nDepartment of State China report, entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005).\nExamples of human rights abuses are many and are carefully covered in the U.S. Department\nof State China report, entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005.  PRC security\npersonnel, for example, are known to place foreign government officials, journalists, and business\npeople, with access to advance proprietary technology, under surveillance.  Hotel rooms and personal\ncomputing devices for these categories are sometimes searched.  See id. \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omission\nAsked to complete an SF-86 in December 2004, Applicant answered no to question 15,\nwhich asked him whether in the past seven years he had ever had an active passport issued by a\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nforeign government (see ex. 1).  Applicant attributes the omission to an oversight and cites his\nacknowledged trip to th PRC in 2000 as corroborative proof his passport omission was inadvertent\n(R.T., at 117-21).  He claims that since he was not a U.S. citizen when he traveled to the PRC in\n2000, he could only have used his Chinese passport.  Applicant cites to all of the information he\nprovided about himself and his family as further proof his passport omission was an honest mistake.\nApplicant\u2019s claimed failure to list his PRC passport due to oversight reflects a plausible\nexplanation and is accepted after considering all of the circumstances surrounding his SF-86\nomission. Questioned about his Chinese passport by an OPM investigator in 2006, Applicant\npromptly acknowledged his previous possession and use of the passport (R.T., at 128-29).\nApplicant\u2019s character references\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor who has worked with him since his employment\nin 2004 R.T., at 81-83).  His supervisor assured that Applicant had never been known to mishandle\nclassified information (R.T., at 86).  Applicant  has received good performance evaluations and has\nnever been disciplined.  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered\nthe identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so\nis clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges\nto make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant was born in the PRC to parents of Chinese descent and immigrated to the U.S. in\n1995.  He became U.S. citizen in 2003 and is a highly regarded engineer for a U.S. defense\ncontractor.  Security issues of concern to the Government focus on members of Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family (his birth father, his maternal and paternal grandparents, and his maternal aunt)\nwho are citizens and residents of the PRC,  a country known to engage in economic data collection\nin the U.S.  Of  security concern, too, is Applicant\u2019s omission of his Chinese passport in his SF-86.\nForeign influence concerns\nGovernment urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate family members\nthat reside in the PRC might be subject to undue foreign influence by PRC authorities to access\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers are citizens of and reside in the PRC, they present potential security risks covered by\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members residing in the\nPRC pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that\ncould compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control.  DC 7(b)\n(connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information) has\npossible application due to the  presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in the PRC.  \nFrom what is known from the accounts of Applicant and his stepfather, neither Applicant nor\nL have any (a) current financial or political affiliations with the PRC\u2019s government, (b) history of\nbeing subjected to any coercion or influence, or (c) apparent exposure to coercion or influence.\nBecause the companies who employed G and L (i.e., OGET and OGEA) for so many years are\ninterconnected and inferentially owned by the PRG, it is difficult to discount risks of G\u2019s being\nexploited by the PRC to enlist Applicant\u2019s cooperation in furnishing sensitive economic data. \nApplicant has not broken his contacts with his father and other immediate family members residing\nin China; even though his contacts have been limited in recent years. \nMitigation is difficult to find, given the history and current political and security conditions\nextant in the PRC, and Applicant\u2019s relationships with his immediate members in the PRC.  The\nPRC\u2019s political and security conditions certainly do not permit the application of MC 8(a) (the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships with his father and other family members residing in the PRC also preclude application\nof any of the other mitigating conditions in the guideline for foreign influence.\nThe PRC is a country that in the past has targeted the U.S. for economic and proprietary data\ncollection, and lacks any demonstrated history of human rights protections and respect for the rule\nof law by most published accounts.  While the PRC still continues to maintain strong diplomatic\ninterests with the U.S., and has shown its capacity to be helpful in strategic efforts to suppress\nnuclear arms threats in the region, it remains an authoritarian regime with a persistent history of\naggressive targeting of the U.S. with active intelligence gathering programs..  \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances still do not dictate per\nse results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general.  But they do place major emphasis on the status of the foreign country\nof concern. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers in the PRC, realistic risks of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the\nhopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant is\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nstill very present, notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s becoming a U.S. citizen and committing himself to\nprotecting classified information.  See ISCR Case No. 01-10128, at 4-5 (Appeal Bd. Dec. January\n6, 2005) (citing, inter alia, the lack of record evidence that the applicant\u2019s family members were not\nin a position to be exploited by the PRC government).\nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s demonstrated commitments to the U.S. and the trustworthiness he\nhas enlisted from his employer and stepfather must be counterbalanced by an overall appraisal of all\nof the considerations affecting Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness in light of the geopolitical\nrealities that govern PRC-U.S. relations and the potential for exploitation of Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily members residing in the PRC.    Piecemeal analysis has, of course, been consistently rejected\nby the Appeal Board when assessing security risks associated with an applicant\u2019s having family\nmembers in a foreign country.  See ISCR Case No. 01-22693 (September 22, 2003). \nOverall, potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's immediate family members\n(viz., his birth father, paternal and maternal grandparents, and maternal aunt) are insufficiently\nmitigated at this time.  Based on the geopolitical status of the PRC, Applicant\u2019s family ties, and the\npast decisional analysis of the Appeal Board), too much uncertainty exists  to permit safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial\nrelationships in the PRC.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered\nby Guideline B.\nSecurity clearance application omission \nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of his omission of his past possession and use of\na Chinese passport in the SF-86 application he completed in December 2004.  By omitting the\npassport he possessed and used before he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant failed to furnish\nmaterially important background information about his foreign passport possession/use that was\nneeded for the Government to properly process and evaluate his security clearance application.  \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omission is attributable to an oversight and not the result of any manifest\nintent to mislead.  Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering both the circumstances surrounding the\nfurnished information at the time and Applicant\u2019s overall reputation for honesty and trustworthiness,\nenable him to convincingly refute the falsification allegations.  Considering all of the evidence\nproduced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the personal conduct guideline\nallegations that Appellant knowingly and wilfully omitted his prior possession and use of a foreign\npassport when completing his security clearance application.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nfactors enumerated in E2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT,\nCONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS and CONDITIONS listed above, I make the following separate\nFORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nRoger C.

Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of the Ukraine.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign family members\ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On November 27, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline B (Foreign Influence),\npromulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs issued as of\nSeptember 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the\nDirective, and Applicant confirmed receipt of the applicable Adjudicative Guideline.   On December\n3\n13, 2006, Applicant filed a signed response to the SOR.  He requested his case be determined on the\nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nFebruary 6, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  Four official U.S.\nGovernment publications containing facts about the Ukraine were appended to the FORM and\nidentified therein as source documents 1 through 4.\nAn undated copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any\nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  On March 5, 2007, Applicant\nrequested an additional 30 days to compile and submit material in response to the FORM.  By letter\ndated March 24, 2007, Applicant forwarded four enclosures, which were, in turn, provided to\nDepartment Counsel for review on April 2, 2007.  The enclosures were identified as Applicant\u2019s\nenclosures 1 through 4.  Department Counsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s four\nenclosures.  On April 12, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  After a careful review of\nApplicant\u2019s four enclosures, I marked them as exhibits (Ex.) A, B, C, and D and admitted them to the\nrecord of this case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse and step-son are citizens of Ukraine and\ncurrently residing with him in a South American country (\u00b6 1.a.); that his mother-in-law, father-in-law,\nand /or brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Ukraine (\u00b6 1.b.); and that Applicant traveled to the\nUkraine in at least 2001 and 2003 and resided in Ukraine from August 2004 to approximately October\n2005 (\u00b6 1.c.) (Item 1.)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without qualification SOR\n\n3\nallegations 1.a. and 1.b.  He admitted travel to Ukraine in 2001 and 2003 and residence in Ukraine.\nHe admitted living in Ukraine for approximately one year between 2004 and 2005.  However, he stated\nhe resided in Ukraine from approximately August 2004 to approximately August 2005, and not\nOctober 2005, as alleged in the SOR.  (Item 3.)  He provided mitigating information.  Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are admitted as findings of fact.\nApplicant, a native-born U.S. citizen, is 47 years old and employed as an airplane pilot by a\nDefense contractor.  Between approximately August 2004 and April 2005, he worked as a contractor\npilot assisting the U.S. military effort in Iraq, where he was wounded in the course of duty.  He is\ncurrently working as a contract pilot in support of U.S. operations in a South American country.  He\nholds a security clearance.  (Item 1; Item 3; Item 4; Ex. A; Ex. D.)\nIn about 2001, Applicant became involved with a charitable organization, headed by a retired\nU.S. military official, dedicated to helping orphaned children in the Ukraine.  Applicant traveled to\nthe Ukraine in 2001 and 2003 and spent his time and personal resources in helping Ukranian orphans.\n(Ex. D.)  From August 2004 until August 2005, Applicant resided in the Ukraine.  In February 2005,\nApplicant married a Ukranian citizen.  (Item 5.)\nApplicant shares his household with his wife, a citizen of Ukraine, and her minor son, who is\nalso a citizen of Ukraine.  At present, Applicant, his wife, and step-son live in a South American\ncountry.  (Item 3.)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are residents and citizens of\nUkraine.  (Item 3.)  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is retired.  On occasion, Applicant wires his mother-in-\nlaw unspecified smaller amounts of money to help with her living expenses.  Applicant sent his bother-\nin-law, who works as a waiter in Ukraine, money to purchase a car and start a business.  The brother-\nin-law\u2019s business plans did not materialize, and he has promised to return the money to Applicant.\n(Ex. A.)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and  father-in-law were divorced in Ukraine in about 1982.  (Ex.\nC.)  The record does not identify the father-in-law\u2019s occupational status, but it does suggest he has\ninfrequent contact with Applicant\u2019s wife.  When Applicant\u2019s wife asked her father to provide\nbiographical information for Applicant to submit with his answer to the FORM, the father asked for\nmoney from Applicant in exchange for his biographical information.  Applicant and his wife rebuffed\nthe father-in-law\u2019s request. (Ex. A.) \nIn order to take her minor son with her to Applicant\u2019s household in the South American\ncountry, Applicant\u2019s wife was required to obtain permission from the boy\u2019s father in Ukraine.  The\nboy\u2019s father wanted money from Applicant in exchange for his signed consent form.  Applicant refused\nto pay the father money, and Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother persuaded the father to sign the form anyway.\n(Ex. A.)\nApplicant\u2019s friend, a retired U.S. military officer, submitted a letter of character reference for\nhim.  The friend stated he had known Applicant for over ten years.  He praised Applicant\u2019s charity\nwork on behalf of Ukranian orphans, and he attested to Applicant\u2019s good character and patriotism.\n(Ex. D.)\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s wife and step-son possess U.S. immigrant visas issued in March 2006.  Applicant\nhas submitted applications for expedited naturalization as U.S. citizens for his wife and step-son. (Item\n3.)  \nI take administrative notice that Ukraine has been independent of the Union of Soviet  Socialist\nRepublics since August 24, 1991 and has a parliamentary-presidential system of government.  Since\nachieving independence from the Soviet Union, Ukraine has undergone profound political and\neconomic change as it aspires to become a market economy and a multi-party democracy.  (See\nfootnotes 1 and 2, FORM at 3.)  \nUkraine\u2019s October 2004 presidential elections focused international attention on the former\nregime\u2019s electoral fraud and its attempts to intimidate the opposition party.  Great numbers of citizens\nprotested the government\u2019s conduct in what has come to be known as the \u201cOrange Revolution.\u201d  While\nsubsequent parliamentary and local elections in March 2006 were in line with international standards,\nand Ukraine now seeks membership in the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and\nNATO, the country\u2019s relationship with Russia remains difficult and complex.  In January 2006, Russia\ncut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine.  Ethnic Russians make up almost one-fifth of the country\u2019s\npopulation, and many ethnic Ukrainians in the south and east of the Ukraine are Russian-speaking.\nThey support close ties with Russia and are suspicious of Ukrainian nationalism.  (See footnotes 4, 5,\n7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, FORM at 4.) \nUkraine has a poor human rights record.  Although Ukrainian law prohibits torture, prisoners\nare tortured during interrogation.  Although arbitrary detention is also outlawed, police arbitrarily\ndetain persons.  The Ukrainian Security Service continues to monitor private communications and\nmovements of individuals without warrants, even though such conduct is officially prohibited.  (See\nfootnotes 13, 14, 15, and 16, FORM at 5.)\nI also take administrative notice that Ukraine operates as a cash economy, and money scams\nincluding credit card and ATM fraud are widespread.  (Source document 3 at 3, 7.)  Ukraine does not\nrecognize dual nationality.  American citizens entering Ukraine with a Ukranian passport will be\ntreated as Ukranian citizens by local authorities.  This may include being required to perform\nmandatory military service.  Ukrainians who have immigrated to the U.S. without obtaining proper exit\nvisas from Ukrainian authorities may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and will be required to\nobtain exit visas before returning to the U.S.  (Source document 3 at 6.) \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\n\n5\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 2, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified.  The\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive\n5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations\nin which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case\nwas issued November 27, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Foreign Influence Guideline identifies the following security concern: Foreign contacts\nand interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should  consider the identity of the foreign country in which\nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations\nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n\nDC 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\n4\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\n DC 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict\n5\nof interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  DC 7(d) reads: \u201csharing living quarters with\na person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\nDC 7(i) reads: \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable\n6\nto exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign group, government, or country.\u201d\n6\nThis case requires the recognition that Ukraine has thrown off the totalitarian government\nimposed by the former Soviet Union and is attempting to establish a stable parliamentary form of\nrepresentative government.  Currently, the country is undergoing systemic changes as it attempts to\nalign itself with European countries and interests and balance its continuing reliance upon Russia for\nbasic necessities.  Unauthorized governmental surveillance of citizens and other individuals continues.\nUkraine\u2019s reliance on a cash economy and the country\u2019s widespread money scams suggest economic\ninstability and a climate in which the sale of information for money can occur.\nApplicant admitted the three Guideline B allegations in the SOR.  The facts in this case raise\npossible security concerns under four Guideline B disqualifying conditions.  Applicant has contacts\nwith and has provided financial assistance to his in-laws who are residents and citizens of Ukraine.\nAdditionally, two residents and citizens of Ukraine, his wife\u2019s father and his step-son\u2019s father,\nattempted to extort money from Applicant in exchange for information or permission sought by\nApplicant in furtherance of his request for a security clearance and custody of his step-son.  While\nApplicant did not pay money as demanded, these facts also raise concerns under Disqualifying\nCondition (DC) 7(a) of Guideline B.4\nApplicant\u2019s wife and minor step-son are citizens of Ukraine.  They retain familial relations\nwith Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law, who are citizens and residents of\nUkraine.  Applicant, a native-born U.S. citizen, shares his household in a South American country with\nhis wife and step-son.  These facts raise concerns under DC 7(b) and DC 7(d) of Guideline B.    \n5\nApplicant traveled to Ukraine in at least 2001 and 2003, and he resided in Ukraine from\napproximately August 2004 to August 2005.  These facts raise concerns under DC 7(i) of Guideline\nB.  \n6\nThere are several Mitigating Conditions (MC) that potentially apply to the disqualifying\nconditions raised by the facts in this case.  Applicant could mitigate Guideline B security concerns if\nhe could credibly demonstrate that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  MC\n8(a).  He could also mitigate Guideline B security concerns if the facts credibly show there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\n\n7\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest  (MC 8(b)); or contact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation (MC 8(c)); or the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority (MC 8(d)). \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts, travel, and residence in Ukraine were not the result of U.S.\ngovernment business, and nothing in the record suggests they were approved by a cognizant security\nauthority.  Applicant\u2019s  contacts with his wife and step-son are frequent, on-going, and familial.  His\nrelationship with them is one of affection, loyalty, and obligation.  They reside together in the same\nhousehold.  Both Applicant\u2019s wife and step-son have strong familial ties to residents and citizens of\nUkraine, and under the current political and economic conditions in Ukraine, these relationships create\na risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his in-laws in Ukraine, especially his mother-in-law and brother-in-\nlaw, are neither casual nor infrequent.  He provides periodic economic support to his retired mother-in-\nlaw, and he has provided his brother-in-law with money to start and operate a business. Their reliance\non him for money could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  Additionally, Applicant\nfailed to demonstrate that his relationship with his wife and his and his wife\u2019s relationship with her\nmother, father, and brother do not create a conflict of interest that could be exploited in a way that\ncould force him to choose between loyalty to his wife and her family members in Ukraine and the\nsecurity interests of the United States.  ISCR Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2005.)\nAccordingly, I conclude that MCs 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d) are inapplicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process, as defined at E2.2. of the Directive, is \u201cthe careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables known as the whole person concept\u201d and further requires the consideration of\nreliable information, favorable and unfavorable, about a person\u2019s past and present conduct.  The\nfollowing factors should be considered in evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct under\nthe whole person concept: \u201cthe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation;\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for\nthe conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d (See Directive, E2.2.1.1 to E2.2.1.9.) \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board stated that\nan administrative judge\u2019s whole person analysis, when Guideline B allegations are involved, must give\nspecial weight to situations where an applicant \u201chas established by credible, independent evidence that\nhis compliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which an applicant . . . made a significant contribution to the national security.\u201d\nThe Appeal Board recognized that an applicant\u2019s conduct under such conditions can give credibility\nto his assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts\nat coercion or exploitation. \n\n8\nIn 2004 and 2005, prior to his marriage, Applicant served as a contractor pilot in Iraq, and he\nwas wounded in the course of duty.  Since that time, Applicant has taken on new family\nresponsibilities.  Applicant, a native-born U.S. citizen, is an honorable family member who seeks to\ncare for his wife, step-son, and his in-laws, all of whom are citizens of Ukraine.  Without minimizing\nthe quality or significance of his prior service, it must be recognized that in carrying out his family\nresponsibilities, Applicant has made choices that could make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation,\nor pressure and could cause the compromise of classified information.  I have carefully reviewed the\nadministrative record, Applicant\u2019s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR.  I have weighed the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct in\nlight of the whole person concept identified at \u00b6 E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  After doing so,\nI conclude allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR  against Applicant.\nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR or in the\nadministrative record suggested he was not a loyal American citizen.

On December 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested\n\nThe Judge made formal findings favorable to Applicant on two other SOR allegations, one alleging a cheating\n1\nincident at University A in 2000 and another alleging that Applicant was advised of the local criminal tresspass law as\nhe was being escorted off campus by campus police in April 2004 after being expelled from University B. \n2\na hearing.  On July 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Because Applicant fails to establish error on the part of the Judge,\nthe Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThis case involves allegations of academic dishonesty.  One SOR allegation alleges that\nApplicant was found guilty of plagiarism by University A in 1999.  On appeal, Applicant does not\ndispute the allegation or the underlying conduct.  He does argue that the Judge should have\nconcluded that the conduct was mitigated.  Another SOR allegation alleges that Applicant was found\nguilty of academic misconduct by University B in November 2003.  While Applicant admits the\nhistorical fact of the finding of misconduct by University B, he denies the underlying conduct and\nalleges error on the part of the Judge for finding that the underlying conduct occurred.  Additionally,\nApplicant argues that consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d mandated a favorable decision.  \n1\nApplicant argues that the 1999 act of plagiarism is mitigated because of the passage of time\nand that, in the eyes of University A, his conduct was mitigated because they changed his grade from\na grade indicating academic dishonesty to a straight \u201cF.\u201d  Once the government presents evidence\nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation. Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does\nnot turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather,\ntheir application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  In this case, the Judge did not analyze the 1999 plagiarism in\nisolation, but instead properly considered its security significance with reference to other evidence\nin the record, including a subsequent instance of academic dishonesty.  Applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence, or his ability to argue for a different interpretation\nof the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that he was not guilty of academic dishonesty while enrolled in University\nB in 2003.  He asserts that the university was engaged in unjustified retaliatory action against him\nfor his actions in an unrelated matter.  Applicant also asserts that there was insufficient documentary\nevidence to support a finding that he engaged in academic misconduct.  We have reviewed the\nJudge\u2019s findings and the record as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony.  The Judge\u2019s\nfinding that Applicant engaged in academic misconduct at University B in 2003 is based on\nsubstantial evidence and reflects a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  See Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168(1962)).\n\n3\nApplicant also argues that considering him as a whole person, the Judge\u2019s decision must be\nreversed.  He points to his academic achievements and his successful work history and reputation\nsince the instances of academic dishonesty.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge\nweighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying\ncircumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.\nHe reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge has articulated a rational\nexplanation for his unfavorable determination under the disqualifying and mitigating factors as well\nas the whole-person concept. \n         \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffery D.

On December 22, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on February 13, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on June 6, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 7, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for June 29, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nThe Government offered one exhibit that was marked Government Exhibit (GE) 1, and admitted\nwithout objection.

In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is single with no children.2\nApplicant graduated high school in 1999. He attended a state university at their main campus that\nfall. During Applicant\u2019s first year at the college, he was required to write a paper about a television\nshow for an English class. Part of his paper was very similar to an actual advertising piece that the\nshow released. The advertising piece was available over the internet.

Applicant was found guilty of plagiarism at an academic discipline hearing, and was given a\nfailing grade for the course. Applicant appealed the decision, but the appeal was denied.  \n3\nApplicant was accused of cheating by a faculty member of the same university in about\nSeptember 2000. Applicant was scheduled for a hearing before the student honor council on\nSeptember 19, 2000. Applicant retained an attorney who negotiated a settlement agreement and\nrelease of liability dated September 18, 2000. The university agreed not to seek a resolution of the\nallegation of academic dishonesty against Applicant. The grade for the course would be \u201cNG\u201d or no\ngrade. Applicant agreed to immediately voluntarily leave the university, promising not to return for\n\nTr. at 67-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE G, H, K.\n4\nTr. at 29-32.\n5\nTr. at 70-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE N.\n6\nTr. at 32-46, 70, 109-110.\n7\n4\nfuture enrollment. The agreement specifically stated that it was not to be construed as an admission\nof liability by either party, and that both parties expressly denied liability.4\nApplicant testified he did not cheat. He was a computer engineering student. Applicant was\nrequired to create a computer program. It was discovered that his computer program was very similar\nto another student\u2019s program. Applicant stated he did not know the other student and is not aware\nhow this happened. He stated he accepted the agreement because he felt that because of his previous\nincident that he would be presumed guilty.  \n5\nApplicant enrolled as a computer engineering student in a college within the same state\nuniversity system starting with the spring 2001 semester. During the fall 2003 semester, Applicant\nwas accused of cheating. Applicant was afforded a hearing before an academic conduct committee.\nThe professor who made the cheating allegation, several teaching assistants, and Applicant all\ntestified at the hearing. On November 18, 2003, the academic conduct committee recommended that\nApplicant be expelled for academic misconduct. Applicant met with the university president on\nNovember 19, 2003. The president dismissed Applicant from the university effective immediately.\nDespite being told that he was expelled effective immediately, Applicant enrolled in the spring 2004\nsemester for the university on November 20, 2003. Several days later, the academic conduct\ncommittee and the president decided to allow Applicant to complete the fall 2003 semester.\nApplicant was advised of this on November 25, 2003, and told that his expulsion was to commence\nat the conclusion of the fall 2003 semester.  \n6\nApplicant stated the allegation of cheating was that he erased the red ink grade on a blue\nbook test, and wrote a better grade. Applicant testified the allegation of cheating was in a Basic\nCircuit Theory class which he took the semester before, in the spring 2003 semester. Applicant\ndenied cheating, and stated he believes he was accused of cheating as retaliation for filing a\ngrievance against a professor about a grade he received in a class. Applicant also stated that he\nalerted a professor in another class to potential cheating by up to 20 students. According to\nApplicant, this professor was prevented from writing a recommendation on his behalf. Applicant also\nbelieves he made enemies at the university when he reported that the university accidently released\nthe names and social security numbers of more than 10,000 people on a web site. Applicant was not\nrepresented by counsel at the academic hearing because he stated he asked someone at the university\nabout retaining a lawyer, and he was told that if he brought a lawyer, he would \u201cbe found guilty no\nmatter what.\u201d7\nApplicant states that when he met with the president, the president told him that he was\nexpelled from the university because he was disrespectful to a teacher by accusing the teacher of\narbitrary and capricious grading. In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that when he was told\nby the university he could return to class, he was told that he \u201cwas allowed to come back and finish\nthe semester and possibly more.\u201d  Applicant testified that when he was told he could return to school,\n\nTr. at 52-53, 58-59, 73-78; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n8\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE L, N.\n9\nAE A.\n10\nTr. at 78; AE M.\n11\nTr. at 79.\n12\nTr. at 85; AE N, O.\n13\n5\nthat \u201c[t]here wasn\u2019t any stipulation on for how long or for anything like that.\u201d It was simply that\n\u201c[he] could return to class.\u201d Applicant also testified that he was informed that he could return to\nschool before he registered for the spring semester.  \n8\nAs addressed above, Applicant enrolled in the spring semester for the university on\nNovember 20, 2003. His father wrote a check to the university in the amount of $3,694 for\nApplicant\u2019s tuition on December 23, 2003. Applicant attended a full schedule of classes during the\nspring 2004 semester.9\nIn about December 2003 or January 2004, Applicant requested the university to provide a\ntranscript of his grades to another college. The university sent his transcript dated January 15, 2004,\nto this college. It was received by the college on January 21, 2004.10\nApplicant retained an attorney after his academic hearing and after he was notified that he\ncould return to school, in about late November or early December 2003. On April 2, 2004,\nApplicant\u2019s attorney received written verification from the university\u2019s registrar that Applicant was\nenrolled as a full-time undergraduate student at the university.  Applicant was asked at the hearing\n11\nwhy he retained an attorney if he was told that he was permitted to return to the university without\nany restrictions. Applicant responded:\nIt\u2019s America. I mean, people retain lawyers and I thought it was in my best interest\nin case something were to change - - since I received no documentation from them\nabout being able to return, that it was in my best interest to get a lawyer.12\nIn about April 2004, Applicant was escorted off the university campus by the campus police.\nOn April 19, 2004, the university\u2019s general counsel sent Applicant a certified letter stating that\nApplicant was expelled the previous semester, effective at the conclusion of the fall 2003 semester.\nThe letter stated that Applicant was not authorized to be a student at the university. Applicant\u2019s\ntuition for the semester was refunded. Applicant was advised that if he entered the university\u2019s\ncampus that he could be charged with criminal trespass.13\nI find that Applicant was informed that he was expelled from the university effective at the\nend of the fall 2003 semester. Applicant registered for the spring semester on November 20, 2003,\nthe day after he was told by the president he was expelled, but before he was told he could finish the\nsemester. I further find that Applicant\u2019s ability, as an expelled student, to register, pay for classes,\n\nApplicant\u2019s false testimony and statements in response to the SOR are not considered for disqualifying\n14\npurposes, but may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the\npotential application of mitigating conditions.\nTr. at 111-112; AE A.\n15\nTr. at 62; AE B, P.\n16\nTr. at 64; GE 1; AE C-F, I, J.\n17\n6\nand attend classes for several months must have resulted from a failure of the university\u2019s tracking\nsystem. \nApplicant is not a credible witness. His statements were contradictory, and counter to logic\nand common sense. I find Applicant committed plagiarism in about 1999 or 2000, and cheated in\n2003. I further find that he intentionally provided false information about these incidents in his\nresponse to the SOR, and during his testimony at the hearing.14\nApplicant\u2019s grades at the university he was expelled from were generally good, earning a\ncumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.01. He had difficulties with certain classes. In the spring\n2001 semester, he received Ds in Calculus and Analytic Geometry II and Introductory Physics II.\nHe took both courses again in spring 2002, receiving another D in Calculus and Analytic Geometry\nII and a C in Introductory Physics II. He took Calculus and Analytic Geometry II for the third time\nin the fall 2002 semester, and received a C. Applicant testified he had problems with this class\nbecause the professor had a heavy accent that made it difficult to understand what he said. In the\nspring 2003 semester, Applicant received a D in Basic Circuit Theory and an F in Introductory\nDifferential Equations. Applicant testified the Basic Circuit Theory class was the class with the\ncheating allegation, and Introductory Differential Equations was also taught by the professor with\nthe strong accent.15\nOn August 3, 2004, Applicant received notification that he was awarded a $4,000 per year\nscholarship to attend the college that received his transcript on January 21, 2004, as addressed above.\nApplicant attended this college and graduated Summa Cum Laude in May 2006, with a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in computer engineering.16\nApplicant has worked for his current employer since October 2005. He submitted several\nletters from a professor and work supervisors praising him for his integrity, responsibility,\nleadership, initiative, judgment, maturity, professionalism, technical expertise, dedication,\nperformance, reliability, loyalty, trustworthiness, persistence, and honesty. They recommended him\nfor a security clearance.17\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n18\nId. at 527.\n19\nExec.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n21\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n22\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n23\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\n8\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe potential Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) in this case are PC DC 16\n(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information), PC DC 16 (d) (credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by\nitself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited\nto consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or\nother government protected information; . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . ), and\nPC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates\na vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nThe allegations that Applicant committed plagiarism in 1999 or 2000, and cheated in 2003,\nwere both adjudicated at academic discipline hearings, and he was found \u201cguilty\u201d on both occasions.\nApplicant graduated Summa Cum Laude from a third college, and argued that means he did not need\nto cheat. Applicant\u2019s academic record at this institution is commendable, but it does not detract from\nthe fact that Applicant struggled in several of his classes at the second institution. I find there is\ncredible information that Applicant committed plagiarism in 1999 or 2000, and cheated in 2003. PC\nDC 16(d) and PC DC 16(e) are applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c. \nI do not find there is credible information that Applicant cheated in 2000. Applicant denied\nhe cheated. This allegation of cheating was not adjudicated at a hearing. Applicant agreed to\nwithdraw from the school. The agreement specifically stated that it was not to be construed as an\nadmission of liability by either party, and that both parties expressly denied liability. There was no\nindependent evidence submitted to prove that Applicant cheated. I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.b. in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant registered for his spring 2004 semester and attended classes, knowing that he had\nbeen expelled, effective at the end of the fall 2003 semester. It was clearly an administrative error\non the part of the university to permit Applicant to enroll for that semester. I do not find this\nconstituted criminal trespass on Applicant\u2019s part. It is apparent Applicant was hoping he would fall\nthrough the cracks, and that the university might reconsider his expulsion, as they previously did\nwhen he was permitted to finish the semester after initially being told he was expelled effective\nimmediately. This was obviously not the most intelligent course of action by Applicant, as he was\n\n9\nrefunded his tuition, but wasted several months in school. However, I do not find that it is sufficient\nto trigger a disqualifying condition. I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.d. for Applicant.\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), PC MC 17(e)\n(the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress), and PC MC 17(f) (the information was unsubstantiated or from a source\nof questionable reliability). \nThe allegations against Applicant all occurred when he was in college. The most recent\nincident of cheating occurred in 2003. Applicant denied he intentionally plagiarized a paper or\ncheated. Applicant was less than totally candid in his response to the SOR and at his hearing. He has\nnot taken responsibility for his actions. I find these actions are not minor, but go to the very core of\nsecurity worthiness. Applicant had an opportunity to rehabilitate himself after the initial plagiarism\nincident. He did not. He was struggling with certain math and science classes, and chose to cheat.\nHis willingness to break the rules by cheating when he was already on notice creates a very serious\nsecurity concern. His lack of candor only heightens that concern. I conclude that no mitigating\ncondition applies.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant plagiarized a paper in college in 1999 or 2000, resulting in an F for the class. He\nwas accused of cheating at the same institution in 2000, and agreed to leave school rather than face\na disciplinary hearing. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant actually cheated on this occasion.\nHowever, Applicant was on notice that cheating would not be tolerated. Despite the previous actions,\nApplicant cheated on another test in 2003, at another institution, resulting in his expulsion. Applicant\ngraduated Summa Cum Laude from a third college, and received outstanding character letters on his\nbehalf. I also considered that Applicant was less than totally candid in his response to the SOR and\nduring his testimony. Applicant has a history of dishonesty that continued through his hearing. This\nraises serious doubts about his judgment and trustworthiness.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his personal conduct.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",
