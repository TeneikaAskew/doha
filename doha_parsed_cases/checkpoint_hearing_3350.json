He noted that he \u201ch[as] charge off\u2019s that \nare affecting my credit report adversely\u201d, named a law firm that was assisting him, and \nnoted that he was \u201c[d]isputing negative marks on [his] credit record.\u201d (GE 1 at 38) He did \nnot identify specific delinquent accounts, and denied that, in the previous seven years, he \nhad any property voluntarily repossessed, defaulted on any loan, had accounts turned \nover for collection or charged off, and denied that he had been, or was then, over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt. (GE 1 at 38-39) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, totaling approximately $41,843 including \nan auto loan charged off in December 2017 in the approximate amount of $32,918. \nApplicant denied all allegations, noting that he had retained a law firm and that the debts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e were not reflected in, or had been deleted from, \nhis credit report. (SOR Response) \nApplicant submitted a January 2022 civil judgment reflecting that he had married \na woman in January 1998, they \u201chad lived as Husband and Wife until their final separation \nin May 2017 [and] it was later determined that said marriage was and is void as Wife was \nmarried to another man at the time that the parties marriage occurred.\u201d (AE E; Tr. 108-\n111)  The judgment dissolved Applicant\u2019s marriage, and ordered him to pay $308 monthly \nin child support until no later than November 2022, to support the parties\u2019 then minor child. \nHe attributed his financial difficulties to maintaining two separate households (for himself \nnear his employment since June 2017 and his family a few hours away), fraudulent debt \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccrued in his name through identity theft, annulment of his marriage, his purported wife\u2019s \nexpenditures, and her failure to make payments on certain bills. (Tr. 32-37, 49-50, 113-\n116) \nApplicant reported being the victim of identity theft from November 2020 to April \n2021 to local police. (AE F) He alleged that five named credit-card accounts and a \n\u201cLegacy (NOI)\u201d account had been fraudulently opened using his personal information, \nand that charges totaling $4,700 ($500, $700, $800, $900, $900, and $900) had been \nmade on those accounts. (AE F; Tr. 33-34) Those accounts do not correlate by creditor \nname, account number, debt amount or otherwise with any delinquent debt alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant testified that, in approximately 2020, he submitted another police report \nalleging other accounts had been fraudulently opened with his personal information, that \nhe believed that report included some accounts alleged in the SOR, and that he would \nsubmit that report after the hearing, but did not do so. (Tr. 62-66, 73-76) He did not inform \npolice that he suspected his purported wife used his identify to open accounts in his name, \nand was unaware of any police action taken after he filed the reports. (Tr. 111-112; AE F) \nApplicant testified that from approximately 2018 until approximately 2021, he\nretained a law firm to assist in repairing his credit, and paid them approximately $100 per \nmonth. He said that he terminated that relationship in 2021 because he was not satisfied \nwith the results and had worked with another credit repair company since. (Tr. 48-58, 95-\n106) He said the current credit repair company was working to resolve approximately \n$4,000 in debt, and submitted evidence that he paid them approximately $110 monthly \nfrom February to June 2022. (Tr. 56-58, 66, 85-86; AE B at 2, 6, 10, AE M at 2, 7)  \n \nApplicant submitted three credit reports dated May 11, 2022, that did not \nspecifically reference any of the debts alleged in the SOR. Those credit reports reflected \nthat he was then current on all except one account, a credit account delinquent in the \napproximate amount of $442. (AE A) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: vehicle loan account charged off for $32,918. A September 2018 \ncredit report reflects an individual vehicle loan account was opened in August 2016, past \ndue in the amount of $35,963, and charged off in December 2017 for $32,918. (GE 2) \nApplicant provided extracts of credit records from July 2021 reflecting that the individual \naccount was opened in August 2016, delinquent in December 2016, charged off in \nDecember 2017, and purchased by another creditor. (AE J at 1-2, AE K at 2, AE L at 2-\n3) Applicant denied the allegation noting that he had retained representation, that the \ncreditor alleged in the SOR had no record of the account, and that this account was not \nreflected in his credit report. (SOR Response)  \nApplicant testified that the delinquent account was a loan he had obtained to \nfinance a new pickup truck in 2016, that the monthly payment on the loan was $700, that \nwhen he started missing payments he asked his then spouse to make payments from a \njoint account they shared.

(Tr. 98-99) He said that the creditor provided documentation indicating that \nbecause it was such an old loan that he owed nothing and that \u201cthey couldn\u2019t come after \nthe money that was supposed to have been owed for it.\u201d (Tr. 51, 53; AE G) He provided \na September 2021 letter titled \u201cExplanation of Calculation of Surplus or Deficiency\u201d that \nstated \u201c[t]his communication is from a debt collector [and] is an attempt to collect a debt \nand any information will be used for that purpose.\u201d (AE I) The letter noted that: due to the \ndebt\u2019s age the creditor would not sue Applicant or report payment or non-payment of the \ndebt to a credit bureau; the amount owed on the loan after the September 2021 sale of \nthe vehicle was $32,014.48 plus additional costs for a total deficiency balance of \n$33,285.23; Applicant was liable for the deficiency balance, and that the creditor \ndemanded payment of the deficiency balance.

(SOR Response) He testified that this was his military \nexchange account, that he had added his purported wife as an authorized user, that she \nhad used the account to purchase various items, that the debt was currently $3,760, and \nthat he was timely paying the account. Although the account information in the credit \nreports does not fully align, Applicant\u2019s testimony was partially corroborated by the May \n2022 credit reports, and I find this account is being resolved.

Applicant \ndenied the allegation noting that he had retained legal representation. (SOR Response) \nHe testified that this was a utility account for a residence occupied by his purported wife \nand their then minor child, that he had paid the bill, and that he could contact the company \nand obtain proof of payment. He provided no documentary evidence that he contacted \nthe creditor, made payments on or otherwise resolved the debt. This debt is unresolved. \n(GE 2; Tr. 83-84) \nApplicant testified and provided documentary evidence that his financial condition \nhas improved. He provided documentary evidence of approximately $9,500 in net monthly \nincome including approximately $5,000 (federal contractor pay), $1,175 (Navy retired \npay), $3,332 (Veteran\u2019s Administration disability payments for 100% disability rating), and \nunspecified income from a motorcycle repair business. (AE B; Tr. 86-93). Records from \nFebruary 2022 through June 2022, reflect that his monthly checking account balance \nranged from approximately $18,000 to $23,000, and his monthly savings account balance \nincreased from approximately $1,900 in November 2021 to $11,623 in May 2022. (AE B, \nC, D, M) He did not provide a monthly budget, but estimated his monthly expenses at \napproximately $3,500. (Tr. 90). He testified that he had reviewed his debts with a credit \nrepair agency and believed that constituted financial counseling, and received financial \nmanagement training while in the Navy. (Tr. 84-85, 94) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from a supervisor, team leader, and \na co-worker. They favorably commented on his work ethic, technical skills, workmanship, \ncommitment to the team, dependability, trustworthiness, integrity, and recommended him \nfor a security clearance or a public trust position. (AE N) His friend and romantic partner \nof two years also testified.

(Tr. 136-37) \nAny derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in a whole-person analysis. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence including the September 2018 credit \nreport establish that he has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2017. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant provided credit reports from May 2022 that did not reflect delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. However, evidence that some debts have dropped off recent \ncredit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 \nat 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citation omitted). \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer appear \non credit reports is not reason to believe that they are not legitimate or that they have \nbeen satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2017) \n(citation omitted). The absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does \nnot extenuate or mitigate a history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial \nreform or rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. The debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and \n1.h have not been resolved. The largest delinquent debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a - $32,918) was \nincurred in August 2016, charged off in December 2017, and subject of a demand for \npayment by the creditor in September 2021. The delinquent debts alleged in SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.f, and 1.h total an additional $2,172. He has provided insufficient documentary evidence \nof any effort to pay, settle or otherwise resolve these delinquent accounts. These debts \nare ongoing and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. His \nconduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s September 2017 separation from \nhis purported wife, claims that she did not make payments on some debts, subsequent \nannulment of that marriage, and claims that someone improperly used his identity to \nobtain credit contributed to his financial problems were conditions beyond his control. He \nclaimed that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e resulted from fraud and identity \ntheft, but did not submit sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate those claims. \nAlthough provided an opportunity to submit additional evidence, including a police report \nthat he contended would support his claims he did not do so. I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.e in his \nfavor because his claim that this debt resulted from identity theft is at least partially \ncorroborated by documentary evidence that he disputed the debt. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence that he or his representative contacted the remaining creditors, \ndisputed, made payments on, or otherwise resolved the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c, or that he otherwise acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant testified that he worked with two credit \nrepair services, claimed that he had received financial counseling and attended courses \nin financial management. However, he failed to provide sufficient evidence that he \nreceived financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, and has presented \ninsufficient evidence that the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h are \nbeing resolved, or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant provided documentary evidence that \nhe is resolving the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He provided insufficient documentary \nevidence that he has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay the creditors \nor otherwise resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h. \nOf particular note, Applicant acknowledged that he incurred the delinquent debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, totaling at least $32,918, but presented insufficient evidence of a \ngood-faith effort to resolve that debt. Although he claimed the debt had been forgiven \nbecause of its age he presented no evidence to corroborate that assertion; but submitted \nevidence the then creditor contacted him in September 2021 in an effort to collect the \ndebt. The Appeal Board discussed stale debts in a security clearance case, which also \napplies here. \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.  \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) (citation omitted). \nAG 20(e) is not fully established. Applicant averred that he disputed several of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. However, with the exception of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nhe has provided insufficient evidence to establish a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h, or of \nactions he has taken to resolve those issues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were already \naddressed, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 52 years old, served 20 years on active duty, was \nhonorably discharged, and retired from the Navy in 2012. I also considered that he held \na security clearance while on active duty in the Navy, and was determined by the VA to \nbe totally and permanently disabled due to service-connected disabilities. I considered \nthat he is respected by his supervisors, co-workers and girlfriend. I also considered that \nrecent credit and bank records reflect that his financial situation has significantly \nimproved. \nHowever, of the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has resolved \nor is resolving only two debts totaling approximately $1,664. He has provided insufficient \nevidence that he has resolved, or attempted to resolve the six remaining delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $40,179 including a delinquent vehicle loan of approximately \n$32,918. His decision not to make payments on or otherwise attempt to resolve the \nvehicle loan debt may have helped him to put his finances in order, but that decision also \nraises potentially disqualifying and current trustworthiness concerns under the Directive. \nA public trust adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. \nBd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his debt-\nresolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an [he] act \nresponsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent \nto effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 37 years old. He was married from June 2013 to December 2017, when he and his wife divorced. They have a seven-year-old daughter, born in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 26-28) Applicant has some college credits and an Information Technology (IT) certification. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 to 2016. He deployed to Iraq twice during 2009-2011. He was discharged honorably as a staff sergeant (E-5). (GE 1; Tr. 30) Applicant is considered to be \u201ctotally and permanently disabled\u201d by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and his disability is 100% service- connected. He receives $3,757 a month in compensation. (AE F; Tr. 52-53) After leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked briefly for an auto dealer and a grocery chain (2016-2017) before joining the defense industry in June 2017. He worked for a large defense contractor from 2018-2020, and was earning $50,000 annually when he left, after earning his IT certification. When he changed careers and jobs, his starting annual salary at his next job was $45,000.

He initially \nrequested an administrative determination, but on or about May 25, 2022, he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. (Tr. 4) The case was assigned to me on April \n18, 2023. \nOn May 4, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for May 22, 2023, by video teleconference through an \nonline platform. The hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, all of which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not offer any exhibits. I held the post-hearing record open to \nallow him the opportunity to submit additional information. He timely submitted six \ndocuments, which are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F and admitted \nwithout objection. A June 4, 2023 e-mail from Applicant is marked as AE G. They are \nidentified in the Facts section, below. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June \n5, 2023, and the record closed on June 13, 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E is an Excel spreadsheet entitled, \u201cPersonal Monthly Budget.\u201d \nOn the printed copy of AE E, the font is not large enough to read the data. However, the \ncopy that Applicant sent by e-mail is legible, and I have reviewed it (with details discussed \nin the Facts section, below, as needed). In the event it is necessary to provide the emailed \ncopy of AE E for appellate review, I will do so upon request. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all six debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) with a brief general \nexplanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He was married from June 2013 to December 2017, \nwhen he and his wife divorced. They have a seven-year-old daughter, born in March \n2016. (GE 1; Tr. 26-28) Applicant has some college credits and an Information \nTechnology (IT) certification. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 to \n2016. He deployed to Iraq twice during 2009-2011. He was discharged honorably as a \nstaff sergeant (E-5). (GE 1; Tr. 30) Applicant is considered to be \u201ctotally and permanently \ndisabled\u201d by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and his disability is 100% service-\nconnected. He receives $3,757 a month in compensation. (AE F; Tr. 52-53) \nAfter leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked briefly for an auto dealer and a \ngrocery chain (2016-2017) before joining the defense industry in June 2017. He worked \nfor a large defense contractor from 2018-2020, and was earning $50,000 annually when \nhe left, after earning his IT certification. When he changed careers and jobs, his starting \nannual salary at his next job was $45,000. He remained with that company and its \nsuccessor until March 2023 (leaving with a salary of $60,000), when he began working \nfor his current employer and clearance sponsor. His salary is now $68,500.

He \nnoted that he retained a credit counseling firm, has been taking their financial advice, and \nhas been cutting expenses. (GE 1 at 39; Answer) \nThe SOR debts were incurred jointly during the marriage rather than after the \ndivorce. (Tr. 31-34) Applicant said his former wife declined to assume responsibility for \nany of them, so he did so when they divorced. (Tr. 51) Applicant testified that he was not \nmaking a sufficient income to address his debts and his child support obligations until he \njoined the IT field. He started at the bottom, has excelled, and is working his way up to \nleadership. With promotions, he began to attain financial stability and is now better able \nto address his debts. (Tr, 20-22) \nThe six SOR debts total about $19,562. They are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and by credit reports in the record, from March 2018 and March 2019. (GE 3, \nGE 4) He also discussed them in his April 2018 background interview. (GE 2) None of the \nSOR debts are reflected on a May 2022 credit report. (GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($5,728) is a charged-off credit-card account. (GE 3, GE 4) After the \nhearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting their agreement to \nsettle the account for $4,297 by May 2024. He said he is to pay $367 per month. (AE D; \nTr. 37-38, 40-43) This account is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($5,506) is a bank credit-card account that has been charged off. (GE \n3, GE 4) After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting \nthat the creditor has agreed to settle the account for $4,130. Applicant is to make a $344 \npayment every month until the account is resolved in April 2024. (AE B; Tr. 35-37, 43-45) \nThis account is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,267) is a bank credit-card account that has been charged off. (GE \n3, GE 4) After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting \nthat the creditor has agreed to settle the account for $1,701. Applicant is to make a \n$141.75 payment every month until the account is resolved in April 2024. (AE A; Tr. 35\u00ad\n37, 45-46) This account is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,393) is a military credit account that has been charged off. (GE 3, \nGE 4) Applicant said he had not arranged to pay this debt but would do so. (Tr. 39, 46) \nThis debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,437) is the balance due on an auto loan account after a \nrepossession. (GE 4) Applicant explained that he prioritized paying child support over \nresolving this debt, which led to the repossession in 2016. (GE 2 at 5-6) Applicant believed \nthat the creditor had told him that they had no record that he owed any money and that \nthey no longer held the debt. (Tr. 38-39, 48-50) After the hearing, he provided \ndocumentation from the creditor reflecting that the payoff amount for the loan is $9,383, \neffective through June 17, 2023. (AE C) He also indicated in a post-hearing e-mail that \nhe is able to pay $250 a month to resolve this debt.

(GE 3) Applicant \nasserted that the debt has been paid and was his former wife\u2019s responsibility. (Tr. 35, 50-\n51)  \nApplicant has lived in State 1 since his wife left in Summer 2016. She lives with \ntheir daughter in another state. (Tr. 34) He has paid child support obligations since then \nand is current. His child support obligations are $900 a month, and he expects a reduction \nto $600 in October 2023. He said he also provides additional funds of about $300 or $400 \na month for his daughter. (Tr. 28-29, 56) \nApplicant has also cut credit-card expenses and moved in with his mother to cut \nliving expenses further. He pays about $1,000 in rent. (Answer; Tr. 55, 57) He estimated \nthat he has $3,000 to $3,500 in monthly expenses, with an income of about $7,800 (salary \nand disability), leaving about $4,400 in surplus. (Tr. 57-58) He provided a budget after the \nhearing. (AE F) He has no past-due taxes or late-filed tax returns, and no other delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 61-63; GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) \nApplicant said he understands the magnitude and importance of his debts and \nintends to pay them. He said he had excellent credit before his divorce and wants to \nimprove his credit and move on with his life and career. (Tr. 39-40) He said he learned \nthat it was important not to let others affect his credit and that \u201cfinancial literacy with your \nsignificant other is another big factor.\u201d (Tr. 60-61) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife left him after the birth of their child, in mid-2016, he \nassumed the family debts. They became delinquent when he was unable to address \nthem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant assumed responsibility for the marital debts, and they became \ndelinquent after he was unable to pay them. He has since improved his employment \nprospects by earning an IT certification, which has led to a better paying job and increased \nfinancial stability. He has also decreased his monthly expenses by moving in with his \nmother. He has settlement arrangements in place for most of his debts, and now has \nbetter ability to address them. Applicant\u2019s debts were incurred due to circumstances \nlargely beyond his control. His debts are limited to this circumstance and he is acting \nresponsibly in addressing them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply since his debts are ongoing. However, Applicant \nhas pursued credit counseling and his debts are being resolved and are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) therefore applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s prior military service \nand the fact that he is a disabled veteran. I also considered the record evidence \nsupporting a finding that Applicants\u2019 debts occurred after his divorce, and he has taken \nsteps to improve his employment marketability and has worked to cut expenses so he \ncan address his debts responsibly. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nduring the hearing and conclude that he testified credibly about his intentions to continue \naddressing his debts responsibly now that he is able to do so. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Edmunds, Esq. \n04/06/2023 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct) and B (Foreign Influence). Applicant mitigated the Guideline B security \nconcerns, but he did not mitigate the Guideline E concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 13, 2018. \nOn July 24, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines K (Handling Protected Information), E (Personal Conduct), B \n(Foreign Influence), and F (Financial Considerations). The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 8, 2020, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On March 8, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. \nOn the same day Department Counsel amended the SOR to withdraw the allegation \nunder Guideline K (SOR \u00b6 1.a), add SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.i under Guideline E, withdraw SOR \u00b6 \n3.b under Guideline B, and withdraw all the allegations under Guideline F. \nApplicant submitted a supplemental response to the amended statement of \nreasons on January 21, 2022. The case was assigned to me on January 24, 2023. On \nFebruary 2, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant \nthat the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on March 7, \n2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 16 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through EE, which were admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Canada and Iraq. (GX 15 and 16) Applicant requested that I take administrative \nnotice of facts about Canada. He submitted two post-hearing exhibits marked as AX FF. \nOne was a motion to supplement testimony and the other was a request for administrative \nnotice. I have marked his request for administrative notice as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I \ntook administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel and Applicant. I have not \ntaken administrative notice of the facts and conclusions in the Congressional Research \nServices documents submitted by Department Counsel (Items II and VI of GX 15), \nbecause there is no evidence that the facts and conclusions in those studies have been \naccepted as U.S. policy. On my own motion and without objection, I took administrative \nnotice of the facts in the State Department fact sheet, \u201cU.S. Relations with Iraq,\u201d dated \nJune 6, 2022. (HX II) The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings \nof fact. \nI kept the record open until March 27, 2023, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX FF through RR, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the amended SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 \n2.d and 3.a. He denied all the other allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 55-year-old strategic cyber-security advisor who has been employed \nby another government agency (AGA) for about a year. (Tr. 18) He was previously \nemployed by a defense contractor as a cyber planner from August 2017 until he was hired \nby the AGA on a date not reflected in the record.

He received a top-secret clearance in 2009 as an employee \nof a defense contractor. (AX HH) \nApplicant attended college on an Army ROTC scholarship, and he was \ncommissioned as an officer in the Army National Guard in May 1989. In February 1992, \nhe received an honorable discharge from the Army National Guard to accept a \ncommission in the Army Reserve. (AX MM) He served on active duty in the Army Reserve \nuntil he was released from active duty in January 1999 and separated with a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions. (AX D at 1) He served in the Army Reserve again \nfrom July 2000 to September 2002 and received an honorable discharge. (GX 11 at 16; \nAX D at 2) He has a 30% disability for service-connected injuries. (AX G; AX NN) He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1989, a master\u2019s degree in June 1992, and a \nmaster\u2019s in business administration in May 2001. \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted testimonials from numerous co-workers and \nsupervisors in the cyber-security field. He is highly regarded for his technical skills, \nleadership, and understanding of foreign policy. (AX A; AX OO) \nThe amended SOR alleges multiple falsifications (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.e-2.i), other \npersonal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.d) under Guideline E, and foreign influence concerns \nunder Guideline B (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c). The evidence pertaining to the allegations in the \namended SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. On November 19, 1998, while Applicant was on active duty, he \nreceived nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 815, on July 19, 1998, for violation of a general order by being in an off-limits \nclub, engaging in private employment at the off-limits club, committing an indecent act \nwith a female stripper, and ejecting the female stripper from his apartment while she was \nnaked above the waist. Initially, he was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer and \nfalse swearing, but those offenses were not reflected in the record of nonjudicial \npunishment. His punishment was forfeiture of $1,600 pay per month for two months and \nrestriction to his quarters and the military installation for 60 days. (GX 4)  \nApplicant testified that he was out-processing when the misconduct occurred, and \nit delayed his separation. (Tr. 47) He was discharged with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions on January 27, 1999. (AX D) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.f, and 2.g. When Applicant submitted SCAs in November 2007, \nAugust 2014, and December 2018, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question asking if he had ever \nhad a security clearance suspended or revoked. His clearance was suspended in July \n1998 while the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b was being investigated, but he did not \ndisclose the suspension of his clearance in any of the SCAs. (GX 2 at 64; GX 10 at 30; \nGX 11 at 77) On August 11, 1999, an attorney acting on his behalf requested that his \nclearance be reinstated. His clearance was reinstated on May 19, 2001.

Because it happened between out-\nprocessing from one unit and in-processing into another unit, I did not consider it to be an \noperational suspension, and I forgot about it completely as a reportable event.\u201d He \nadmitted at the hearing that he now understands that he should have disclosed it. (Tr. 25) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. On January 25, 1999, Applicant opened a checking account with a \nbank on an overseas military installation and deposited a worthless check for $2,050. He \nrepresented on a signature authorization card that he was scheduled to return from \noverseas in May 2000, knowing that he was scheduled to depart on January 26, 1999, \nthe day after he opened the account. He reimbursed the bank after being contacted by \nlaw enforcement authorities. He was not prosecuted. (GX 5) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he had no recollection of this incident. (Tr. \n28, 49) To support his claim of a lack of memory, he submitted evidence that in December \n2021, he was evaluated by his physician for chronic stroke that was discovered during a \nbrain scan. His physician noted that about 50% of stroke patients have memory \nimpairment. (AX X.) Applicant is currently taking a prescription drug to enhance memory. \n(Tr. 78; AX KK; AX LL) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d. In January 2003, Applicant was charged with obstructing a public \nofficer, disorderly conduct involving drugs or alcohol, and disturbing the peace by loud \nand unreasonable noise. In March 2003, he entered a nolo contendere plea. He was \nconvicted, fined, required to pay restitution, and placed on probation for two years. (GX \n9; Tr.28) In November 2012, he filed a petition for dismissal of the charges. His petition \nwas granted in January 2013. The plea and finding of guilt were set aside and vacated. \nA plea of not guilty was entered and the charges were dismissed. (AX JJ; AX PP; AX QQ; \nAX RR) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. When Applicant submitted an SCA in November 2007, he answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the questions asking: \u201cHave you even been charged with or convicted of any \noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs\u201d; and, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have been arrested for, \ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e \nabove?\u201d He did not disclose that he was charged with alcohol-related conduct in January \n2003. He testified that his attorney incorrectly advised him that a nolo contendere plea \nwould result in the entire proceeding being expunged from his record. (Tr. 28) He did not \nprovide any documentation of his lawyer\u2019s advice. \nSOR \u00b6 2.h. In December 2010, a company that Applicant had founded and \noperated filed a lawsuit in British courts against several companies doing business in Iraq, \nseeking damages for violation of the oil rights of Applicant\u2019s company. In December 2013, \na British court ruled that the claim \u201cfailed on every point,\u201d and ordered Applicant\u2019s \ncompany to reimburse the defendants for their costs. In a subsequent proceeding in \nOctober 2014, the High Court of Justice, Queen\u2019s Bench Division, Commercial Court, the \nCourt adopted a summary of the December 2013 findings submitted by a British barrister, \nincluding a finding that Applicant \u201ctold lies and misleading statements from the outset.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(GX 12 at 13) The record does not reflect what statements were made or the context in \nwhich they were made. At the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that the founder and \nchief executive officer of one of the defendants in the British case was a U.S. citizen who \nwas indicted in January 2022 in a U. S. federal court for wire fraud and money laundering. \nHe was subsequently convicted, pursuant to a plea agreement, of five counts of willful \nfailure to file individual income tax returns on income of more than $20 million earned \nthrough the business that Applicant sued. (AX U; AX Y; AX II) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i. In the December 2018 SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d a question \nasking, if in the last seven years, he had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, \nor left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. He did not \ndisclose that he was terminated from a job in December 2015. In his SCA, he stated that \nhe left this job for a \u201cprofessional opportunity.\u201d (GX 2 at 17) At the hearing, he testified \nthat he had an issue with a supervisor, was given the option of moving to another position, \ndeclined the offer, and sought employment elsewhere. He testified that he was informed \nby this employer that his declination would not be recorded as a termination. (Tr. 33-34) \nThe employer\u2019s records reflect that he was involuntarily terminated. However, the same \nrecord reflects that he was eligible for rehire. (GX 13) Applicant\u2019s explanation for his \ntermination is supported by the employer\u2019s records showing that he was eligible for rehire. \n(GX 13 at 2) I conclude that his negative answer to this question was not intentionally \nfalse. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a. Applicant is married to a citizen of Canada. His spouse is a trade \nadvisor for Canada, employed at the Canadian Embassy since August 2001. She \nattended college in the United States from August 1998 to May 2001, obtained a college \ndegree, holds a green card, and intends to become a U.S. citizen. (AX E; Tr. 19) She and \nApplicant began cohabiting in March 2013 and recently married on a date not reflected in \nthe record. (GX 2 at 25) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c. Around 2012, Applicant met an Iraqi diplomat who was promoting\ninvestments in Iraq. In Applicant\u2019s December 2018 SCA, he stated that he met the \ndiplomat at a reception at the Embassy of Iraq, and they became social friends and met \nfor cocktails on multiple occasions. He stated that they visited when the diplomat became \na member of the Iraqi delegation to the United Nations in December 2013. (GX 2 at 40) \nHe testified that they stopped meeting around 2014, met once in 2017, and have not met \nsince early 2020. He testified that when he was employed by an AGA, he disclosed his \nprevious contacts with the Iraqi diplomat to his facility security officer (FSO), and did not \nmake any further contacts after 2020, because he received no guidance from his FSO. \n(Tr. 69-73).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s report to his FSO, dated September 1, 2020, includes the following \ncomments: \nI would note that I already reported this individual as being an ongoing, \nalthough intermittent foreign contact six years ago. I had not heard from this \nindividual in some time, but we remain old friends from his previous time as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na junior diplomat in Washington.

By way of clarification, \nthis did not happen. Rather, I am filing out this form as directed by my FSO \nafter reporting the contact IAW company SOP. \n(AX GG) \nI have taken administrative notice that the United States and Canada share the \nworld\u2019s longest international border, and the defense arrangements between the two \ncountries are more extensive than any other countries. They work to enhance and \naccelerate the legitimate flow of people, goods, and services between the two countries. \nThe two countries are indispensable allies in the defense of North America. They share \ndeeply integrated economies and enjoy the largest bilateral trade and investment \nrelationship in the world. There is no evidence that Canada targets the United States for \neconomic or military intelligence. \nI have taken administrative notice that Iraq is now a key partner for the United \nStates in the region and is considered by the United States as a voice of moderation and \ndemocracy in the Middle East. Iraq benefits from functioning government institutions, \nincluding an active legislature, and plays an increasingly constructive role in the region. \nThe United States maintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, \npolitical, economic, and security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic \nFramework Agreement (SFA). The SFA between Iraq and the United States provides the \nfoundation for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. Covering a wide range of bilateral \nissues, including political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and \nfinance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, \neducation, and environment, it emphasizes the important relationship and common goals \nthe two countries share \nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq focuses on economic reform, assistance to \nvulnerable groups, and democracy and governance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe evidence establishes the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (nonjudicial \npunishment), 2.c (bad check), and 2.d (alcohol-related disorderly conduct). It also \nestablishes SOR \u00b6 2.e, alleging concealment of the fact that he was charged with an \nalcohol-related offense. While Applicant submitted evidence that his conviction was set \naside, he offered no explanation for failing to disclose in his SCA that he had been \ncharged with an alcohol-related offense. When he submitted the SCA in November 2007, \nhe was a well-educated adult who had previously gone through the adjudication process \nin 1992. The questions in the SCA clearly asked whether he had been arrested, charged, \nor convicted of an alcohol-related offense. I conclude that his failure to disclose that he \nwas charged with an alcohol-related offense was an intentional omission. \nThe evidence establishes the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.f, and 2.g. \nApplicant may not have known that his security clearance was suspended while his \nconduct in 1998 was being investigated, and falsification of this part of his 2007 SCA is \nnot alleged. However, he knew that the suspension raised security issues when he \nsubmitted SCAs in August 2014 and December 2018, because he had hired a lawyer in \nAugust 2011 to seek reinstatement of his clearance. His quibbling about whether the \nsuspense was an \u201coperational suspension\u201d is not persuasive. A security clearance \ninvestigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or parse the truth narrowly. ISCR \nCase No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) \nThe evidence does not establish the false statement in a British court, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.h.

The evidence shows that \nApplicant and his supervisor had disagreements, that Applicant was offered another \nposition with the company, and he declined it, preferring to seek employment else. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e) are established by Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications of his \nSCAs. AG \u00b6 16(d) is established for the alcohol-related disorderly conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 2.d. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b (the \nnonjudicial punishment), because it is covered under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and \nJ (Criminal Conduct). It is not applicable to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c (the bad \ncheck), because it is covered under Guidelines F and J. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct his SCAs until \nconfronted with the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d, which \nare mitigated by the passage of time. It is not established for the falsifications alleged in \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.f, and 2.g. They are not minor offenses, and they reflect a pattern of deception. \nAn act of falsification has security significance independent of the underlying conduct. \nSee ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The mitigation of the \nunderlying conduct has little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, \nparticularly where there are multiple falsifications. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug 15, 2011). Falsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of \nthe security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). It is a level of risk one step above a State Department Level \n1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and roughly equivalent to a Level 2 \nadvisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \nNo disqualifying conditions are established by Applicant\u2019s marriage to a citizen of \nCanada and his wife\u2019s employment in the Canadian embassy. The evidence falls short of \nestablishing the heightened risk in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(c) and the potential conflict of interest \nin AG \u00b6 7(b). The United States and Canada are close allies and economic partners, and \nApplicant\u2019s wife is engaged in promoting their economic partnership. There is no evidence \nthat Canada targets the United States for military or economic espionage. \nApplicant\u2019s friendship with an Iraqi diplomat is a closer question. In the past, we \nhave recognized that an applicant\u2019s ties to persons of high rank in a foreign government \nor military are of particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association \nwith such persons the applicant could come to the attention of those interested in \nacquiring U.S. protected information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd. Nov. 3, 2009). Applicant\u2019s initial acquaintance with the diplomat was based on \nApplicant\u2019s economic interests in Iraq. While Iraq is now an ally of the United States, the \nunstable political and military conditions raise the possibility that insurgents and terrorists \nwould coerce or otherwise influence the Iraqi diplomat to obtain military information \nthrough his friendship with Applicant. However, the evidence indicates that Applicant \nterminated his contact with the Iraqi diplomat in 2020 after he reported his contacts to his \nFSO but received no guidance. I conclude that no disqualifying conditions are established \nby Applicant\u2019s friendship with an Iraqi diplomat. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guideline(s), but \nsome warrant additional comment. I have considered Applicant\u2019s lengthy military service, \nhis service-connected disability, and the testimonials to his technical skills, leadership, \nand understanding of foreign policy. I have considered his service as an employee of a \ndefense contractor and multiple government agencies while holding a high-level security \nclearance. I have also considered his lack of candor during the adjudication of his multiple \napplications to continue his security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, but he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K (Handling Protected Information): Withdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.h and 2.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): Withdrawn \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.f: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.g and 3.a, all with explanations. His admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. He and his wife married in 2014. They separated in June 2016. They have one child, a seven-year-old boy, who lives with his mother in another state. Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. In 2010, he enlisted in the Army, serving on active duty for about six years followed by two years in the Reserve. He served in the signal corps and held a clearance. He was discharged honorably in 2018 as a specialist (E-4). He works as a video technician for a contractor on a U.S. military base. He has worked there since leaving the Army in 2016. (Tr. 24, 41-45, 83; GE 1) Applicant\u2019s son was born in December 2015. Applicant testified that he had to take his son to the hospital emergency room several times. The first ER visit was after the boy was spitting up blood. The doctor diagnosed him with having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). A second ER visit was similar. A third time was after the baby would not eat. Applicant said an examination of the baby found \u201cbrain injuries,\u201d so the police became involved, and the child was placed in foster care.

Applicant has resolved or is \nresolving his delinquencies, past-due taxes, and unfiled tax returns. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. Applicant\u2019s indictment for felony child \nabuse was reduced to a misdemeanor. He completed his probation period, and the \ncharge was then dismissed. The offense is isolated and dated, and not likely to recur. \nCriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. Personal conduct security concerns \nalleging deliberate failure to disclose tax issues on his security clearance application are \nnot established. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 15, 2018. \nOn July 10, 2020, and again on December 15, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct), Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline E (personal conduct). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec.

(Other than the dates of issuance, the two SORs are \nidentical, so it is likely that the first SOR, dated July 15, 2020, was never processed. \nThe December 2021 SOR was treated as the one at issue in the case). (Tr. 29) \nIn an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was forwarded to the DOHA hearing office on March 8, 2022, and \nassigned to me on October 5, 2022. On November 2, 2022, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for November 30, 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which I admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without \nobjection. After the hearing, I held the record open to allow him the opportunity to \nsubmit additional documents, which he did. On December 15, 2022, he provided an e-\nmail (AE C), and various documents, which are marked as AE D through AE N, all of \nwhich I admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 12, 2022. The record closed on December 15, 2022. \nAmendment to the SOR \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose certain information on his August 2018 SCA, in answer to: \n\u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record: Taxes In the past seven (7) years, have \nyou failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law \nor ordinance.\u201d  \nThe SOR continues, \u201c[Applicant] answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and thereby deliberately failed to \ndisclose that information as set forth in subparagraph [sic] 2.a and 2.b, above.\u201d \n(Emphasis added) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, and provided a narrative \nanswer that addressed his federal and state income taxes and tax returns for tax years \n(TY) 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Answer) However, the Guideline F debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.b concern child support debt and a debt to a retailer, as discussed below. As \nsuch, they are not responsive to a question on an SCA about taxes. \nThe Government therefore moved to amend SOR \u00b6 3.a by changing \u201cthe \ninformation as set forth in subparagraph 2.a and 2.b, above\u201d to \u201cthe information \nin subparagraphs 2.f and 2.g, above,\u201d since those allegations concern past-due tax \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \ndebts from TY 2016 and 2017.

He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.g and 3.a, all with \nexplanations. His admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a is incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He and his wife married in 2014. They separated in \nJune 2016. They have one child, a seven-year-old boy, who lives with his mother in \nanother state. Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. In 2010, he enlisted in the \nArmy, serving on active duty for about six years followed by two years in the Reserve. \nHe served in the signal corps and held a clearance. He was discharged honorably in \n2018 as a specialist (E-4). He works as a video technician for a contractor on a U.S. \nmilitary base. He has worked there since leaving the Army in 2016. (Tr. 24, 41-45, 83; \nGE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s son was born in December 2015. Applicant testified that he had to \ntake his son to the hospital emergency room several times. The first ER visit was after \nthe boy was spitting up blood. The doctor diagnosed him with having GERD \n(gastroesophageal reflux disease). A second ER visit was similar. A third time was after \nthe baby would not eat. Applicant said an examination of the baby found \u201cbrain injuries,\u201d \nso the police became involved, and the child was placed in foster care. (Tr. 47-48, 87-\n88) \nIn his background interview, Applicant discussed the three incidents: once when \nhis son was injured after falling off a love seat, an occasion when both parents were \npresent. A second incident occurred when Applicant discovered his son had vomited in \nbed; and the third incident occurred when his son fell out of a swing seat, where \nApplicant had placed him while Applicant was taking a shower. After the third incident, \ndoctors diagnosed the boy with broken ribs, bleeding in the brain, and blood in his \nretina. The boy remained in the hospital\u2019s custody until he was placed in foster care. (Tr. \n86-88; GE 2 at 9) \nThe Government\u2019s documents reflect that Applicant was indicted by a grand jury \nand charged with felony child abuse with the offense date between December 29, 2015, \nand May 28, 2016. In August 2016, Applicant was arrested in state 1 and charged with \nfelony child abuse. (GE 3) The Government\u2019s documents also include a motion filed by \nthe state prosecutor seeking to exclude from evidence at trial a finding by social workers \nof the county department of social services (DSS) that, while allegations for both \nparents were unfounded, abuse of the child was concluded to have occurred, \u201cby an \nunknown abuser.\u201d (GE 3 at 20) The DSS report itself is not in evidence here. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant pled no contest to a reduced charge of misdemeanor \ntrespassing. He was sentenced to a maximum of 12 months in jail and a $2,500 fine, \nwith imposition of the sentence suspended for two years (\u201ctwo-year SIS\u201d) on the \ncondition of general good behavior. He was not allowed unsupervised contact with the \nvictim for two years. The case was dismissed on July 10, 2020, following Applicant\u2019s \nsuccessful completion of the good behavior period. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (GE 3; Tr. 48-50, 95-\n96, 98) (The portion of SOR \u00b6 1.a alleging that Applicant was \u201csentenced to two years \nsuspended \u2026\u201d is erroneous). The record does not contain a police report or any \nevidence from law enforcement about the circumstances that led to the indictment \nbeyond what Applicant reported in his background interview and testimony. \nApplicant maintains that he was not at fault and did not cause his son\u2019s injuries. \nHe does not believe his wife caused them either, except perhaps when the son fell off \nthe love seat. Applicant does not believe his wife did anything intentionally to harm him. \nHe denied any anger management issues at the time, or financial problems, or getting \nphysically violent with his wife or child. He did acknowledge some neglect. He denied \nany subsequent incidents involving violence or anger management. (Tr. 88-94) He has \nnot been involved in any subsequent criminal offenses. (Tr. 100) \nApplicant took anger management classes and 10 weeks of parenting classes, \nwhich were mandatory to resume custody. He and the boy\u2019s mother also saw a child \npsychologist, and Applicant and his son also attended without her. (Tr. 93, 96-100) \nApplicant explained in his background interview that he once foster care ended, his son \nwas placed in the care of the boy\u2019s mother. (GE 2 at 11) \nThe boy lives in another state with his mother. They moved there in July 2020. \nApplicant said he last saw his son in November 2022, a few weeks before the hearing, \nwhen he was visiting with Applicant\u2019s parents. Before then, he saw the boy in July 2022 \nwhen Applicant flew down to see his son and he took him to an amusement park out of \nstate, with the mother\u2019s permission. He is not subject to any visitation orders from a \ncourt. (Tr. 50-52) \nThe financial security concerns in the SOR relate to delinquent child support, \npast-due federal income taxes and other delinquent debts, and unfiled federal and state \nincome tax returns. He denied all the Guideline F allegations in his answer, asserting \nthat his debts either had been, or were being, paid, and that his overdue tax returns had \nbeen filed. The debts are established by credit reports from November 2018, August \n2019, and February 2022. (GE 6, 7, 8) \nApplicant explained in his interview that his debts accrued for several reasons, \namong them a drop in pay after he left the Army, renting a large apartment, paying child \nsupport costs while their son was in foster care, and child support to the boy\u2019s mother \nafter she assumed custody. (GE 2 at 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($5,577) is a child support arrearage, as of August 2019. (GE 6, GE 7) \nApplicant asserted that the account has been paid in full.

(Tr. 80) He pays $350 \nin child support every two weeks, directly to the boy\u2019s mother on a voluntary basis. (Tr. \n53, 79) The arrearage is resolved and his child support payments are current. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($2,458) is an account placed for collection by a military retailer. (GE \n6, GE 7) Applicant asserted in his answer that the balance is $432 and he is paying $88 \nevery two weeks. A February 2022 credit report shows a balance of $370. (GE 5) The \naccount is now closed and paid in full. (Tr. 81; AE A at 10) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($1,452) and 1.d ($830) are cell phone accounts placed for \ncollection.

Tr. 81-82) He was \nunable to provide documentation but noted in a post-hearing e-mail that they are no \nlonger listed on his credit report. (AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state 1 income tax \nreturns for TY 2017 and 2018. He filed his TY 2017 federal and state returns in June \n2020, when he filed his TY 2019 federal and state returns. (AE J, AE K) He used a well-\nknown tax preparation software program. In 2018, he could not afford the filing fee, so \nhe decided to mail the returns, which he then neglected to do. (Tr. 57) In 2019, when \nthe software program reminded him that his prior tax returns were still unfiled, he \ncontacted his parents\u2019 tax accountant for assistance. She helped him prepare and file \nhis late returns, and he has \u201cbeen up to date ever since.\u201d (Tr. 56-58) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($4,500) concerns past-due federal income taxes for TY 2017. \nApplicant said he had a $9,408 balance due for TY 2017 and about $595 due for TY \n2018 and was in a 150-month repayment plan. (GE 2) He said he entered into the \npayment plan with the IRS in September 2020 and has been making regular payments \nsince then. (Tr. 59, 67, 85) As of the hearing date, he owed $6,523 on his 2017 federal \ntaxes and $632 for TY 2018, for a total of $7,155 remaining. (AE B; AE H, AE I; Tr. 58-\n59)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($3,803) concerns past due federal income taxes for TY 2016. (GE 2, \nGE 4) As of January 2021, he owed $1,947 in taxes, penalties, and interest. (AE F) As \nof December 2022, the debt has been paid. (AE G) \nApplicant filed his TY 2020 federal and state tax returns on May 15, 2021 (a date \nI consider timely during the COVID pandemic). He was to receive a federal refund of \n$1,828, and he owed $73 in state taxes. (AE M) He filed his TY 2021 federal and state \ntax returns on April 3, 2022. He was to receive a federal refund of $1,889, and he owed \n$54 in state taxes. (AE N) He is up to date on his tax filings, and he owes no past-due \nstate taxes.

(GE 1 at 31) \nIn SOR \u00b6 3.a, as amended, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose, on his August 2018 SCA, that he owed past-due taxes for TY 2016 \nand TY 2017, in answer to the following question: \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record: Taxes In the past seven (7) years, have \nyou failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law \nor ordinance.\u201d (GE 1 at 37) \nApplicant filed his 2016 federal tax return on time, on or about April 15, 2017. A \n2020 IRS account transcript in the record shows he had past-due tax debt from that \nyear (as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g). (GE 4) \nAs previously noted, Applicant did not file his 2017 federal or state income tax \nreturns until June 2020, and he still owes past-due federal taxes for that year (as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f). However, the IRS account transcript for TY 2017 (AE H) shows \nthat he filed an extension on April 15, 2018. That pushed the filing deadline to October \n15, 2018 \u2013 a date after Applicant prepared his SCA in August 2018. Thus, when he \nprepared his SCA, his 2017 federal return was not yet late (though it would be later \nwhen he did not meet the October 2018 deadline). (AE H; Tr. 71-73) It also stands to \nreason that it was not yet established as of August 2018 that he owed taxes for 2017 \n(though he later did). \nIn answering the original SOR \u00b6 3.a, Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate \nfalsification. He said he filed (prepared) his 2017 tax return through the software \nprogram but had a dispute with his son\u2019s mother about claiming their son as a \ndependent. He then did not follow up and complete the filing (until 2020, as discussed). \n(Answer) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant explained that he was paying on his past-\ndue 2016 taxes when he prepared his SCA, which he believed meant that he was no \nlonger \u201cin arrears\u201d and did not have to disclose the debt. He also said he thought he had \nfiled his 2017 tax return through the software program, but only learned later such was \nnot the case. He said he did not intend to mislead the government when he prepared \nhis SCA. (Tr. 61-65, 106-107) Applicant also acknowledged that he should have been \nmore diligent in filling out the SCA. (Tr. 64-65, 109) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s newborn infant was taken to the hospital three times. The \nlast time, he was found to have broken ribs, bleeding on the brain, and blood in his \nretina. Applicant was indicted in August 2016 on a charge of felony child abuse. In July \n2018, he pled no contest to a reduced charge of misdemeanor trespassing. Imposition \nof a 12-month sentence was suspended, pending completion of a two-year probation \nterm, which he completed in July 2020, and the charge was dismissed. AG \u00b6 31(b) \napplies. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant does not dispute the charge or the fact that he pled no contest to the \nreduced misdemeanor, but he denies causing injury to his son. The police report is not \nin evidence, and the only explanations came from Applicant himself, in his background \ninterview and at his hearing. The exact cause of his son\u2019s injuries has not been \nestablished by record evidence. \nThe charge of felony child abuse of a newborn infant is extremely serious, but it \nwas not established whether the injuries occurred due to parental neglect, or actual \nphysical abuse, or whether Applicant had any responsibility for the child\u2019s injuries. \nApplicant was indicted on a charge of felony child abuse but pled no contest to \nmisdemeanor trespassing. A no contest plea establishes that Applicant acknowledges \nthat evidence supports a finding of guilt, and he acknowledged being neglectful in the \ncare of his son. Applicant took parenting classes for 10 weeks, as well as anger \nmanagement classes. He completed the two-year period of good behavior in July 2020 \nand the charge was dismissed, now more than two and a half years ago. Applicant\u2019s \nson, now age seven, lives with his mother in another state, and Applicant is allowed to \nvisit and to take his son out of state for entertainment. Despite the seriousness of the \noffense, it is also dated and isolated. This is the only offense on his record and \nApplicant\u2019s culpability has not been clearly established by record evidence. He has \nmaintained gainful employment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s child support arrearage is resolved, and he is current on his child \nsupport obligation. His other debts are resolved or are being resolved, and he has no \nother debts. Even though he is adhering to a repayment plan, his tax debts remain \nongoing, so he does not get full credit under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nWith the assistance of his parent\u2019s tax preparer, Applicant filed his overdue tax \nreturns in June 2020, before the SOR was issued, and he has been on a repayment \nplan for his federal tax debt since about September 2020. His other debts are resolved. \nHe has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his debts and tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), (d), \nand (g) apply.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAs amended, SOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on \nhis August 2018 SCA that he had past-due tax debt from tax years 2016 and 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g). \nApplicant filed his 2016 federal tax return on time, but he had outstanding tax \ndebt that was not fully paid until 2022. (AE G) Delinquent tax debt as to TY 2016, as of \nthe time of the August 2018 SCA, is established. \nApplicant filed an extension for his 2017 federal tax return. That moved the filing \ndeadline to October 2018 \u2013 after he prepared his SCA. Thus, when he prepared his \nAugust 2018 SCA, his 2017 tax return was not late, and any unpaid taxes owed were \nnot yet established (even if he was found to have owed taxes later). Thus, the \nGovernment\u2019s allegation of a delinquent tax debt for TY 2017, as of the time of the \nAugust 2018 SCA, is not established. Without delinquent tax debt established as a \nprerequisite, the related falsification is not established. This leaves only the tax debt for \nTY 2016. \nApplicant disclosed several other debts on his SCA, including child support. He \nmentioned in two comments that he had delinquent debts but did not have enough \ninformation to provide specifics. He also disclosed his criminal offense, noting that he \nhad been arrested on a felony charge, reduced to a misdemeanor. \nApplicant denied the allegation of deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6 3.a. Under \nthese circumstances, I conclude that his omission of the fact that he owed past-due \ntaxes for TY 2016 on his August 2018 SCA was not deliberate.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has resolved most of his financial delinquencies and is keeping to an \nestablished repayment plan for his federal tax debt. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are resolved. Personal conduct security concerns are not established. The \nallegation under Guideline J is extremely serious, in that it involves serious injuries to \nApplicant\u2019s infant son. There is no greater duty of care than the duty a parent owes to a \nchild. Here, there is no dispute that the child was badly injured. What is not clear is what \nhappened, or who was culpable. Applicant pled no contest to a reduced misdemeanor \ncharge and acknowledged responsibility for neglect. He also completed his two-year \nperiod of good behavior without incident and the charge was dismissed in July 2020. \nThere is no other instance of criminal behavior or family issues. He has taken anger \nmanagement and parenting classes. He is allowed to visit his son and does so. I \nconclude that criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

A subsequent \nbackground investigation raised security issues under Guideline F \u2013 Financial \nConsiderations, and Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct. \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent debts. They are summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: $274 medical account placed for collection. Applicant denies this \ndebt. He does not recognize it. I find for Applicant with respect to this allegation. The \npleading is not sufficient enough to give him adequate notice of the medical debt.

On June 19, 2023, Applicant entered into a payment plan \nwith a law firm. He agreed to make the first payment on June 23, 2023.

In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt because he did not recall it. When he \nreached out to the credit union, they had no record of this debt. The August 2021 credit \nreport indicates that this debt was a paid charge off. I find SOR \u00b6 1.c for Applicant. \n(Answer to SOR, Tr. 48- 49; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.d, 1.f and 1.g alleged three delinquent child support debts in the \nrespective amounts of $2,461, $14,985 and $12,667 that were all placed for collection. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d and 1.f. He \ndenies the allegation in SOR \u00b61.g. He claims he makes two child support payments \u2013 \none for his daughter and one for his son. He claims he only owes about $2,000 in \narrears for his son. He owes a little more for his daughter. Applicant claims the mother \nof his daughter overstated his income by $15,000. He currently pays $860 monthly child \nsupport for his daughter; $800 of which is the monthly support and $60 goes towards \narrears. His monthly child support for his son is about the same. (Tr. 53 \u2013 55; Gov 6 at \n2) \nApplicant was given the opportunity to provide documents that show his history \nof child support payments for each child as well as the current child support balances \nfor each child. He did not provide any documents showing this. His pay statement from \nhis current employer shows that $191.23 is deducted each pay period for court-ordered \nchild support. Applicant testified during the hearing that his paycheck is garnished for \nhis son\u2019s child support. He provided no further proof of his history of child support \npayments for either child. I cannot conclude he is timely paying his child support \nobligations for each child without more specific documentation. (Tr. 53-60, 105-109; \nGov 6 at 2; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $22,945 delinquent automobile debt that has been charged off by \nAuto Dealer #1. Applicant purchased this car after he expected his mother to take over \nthe payments for the loan on the automobile that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He fell behind \nin payments and returned the car to Auto Dealer #1. He received notice about the \ndeficiency judgment in 2017 or 2018 after the dealer sold the car. Auto Dealer # 1 \nrecently offered to accept a lump sum payment of $11,000 or three payments of $7,000 \neach. Applicant testified that he can\u2019t afford the payments. The last time he spoke to \nAuto Dealer # 1 was the Monday before the hearing. (Tr. 60-64, 112-113; Gov 6 at 2; \nGov 7 at 4) The delinquent automobile loan debt remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: $17,020 automobile loan that was charged off by a credit union. \nApplicant\u2019s mother was unable to get an automobile loan. Applicant agreed to give his \nmother his car as long as she made the payments on the loan. Applicant then bought \nthe car that is mentioned in SOR \u00b6 1.e. After a couple months, Applicant\u2019s mother failed \nto make the payments. Applicant turned the car in because he could not afford to make \npayments on two cars. He thought it was a profit-and-loss write off. He never received a \n1099(c) form showing cancellation of the debt by the creditor. He initially claimed the \ncredit union never contacted him about the delinquent car loan. Under cross-\nexamination, he admitted that he received a notice that he owed a deficiency on the \nloan, but never paid it. The debt is unresolved.

He served \nthree months in jail and lived in a halfway house for nine months. (Tr. 36-39, 100-102) \nApplicant purchased another car in 2020. The May 2023 credit report lists the \nautomobile loan for this car as charged off. He testified that his estranged wife has the \ncar and he believed that she was making the payments on the car. (Tr. 113-114; Gov 3 \nat 5) Applicant testified that he is not sure about the status of his federal taxes, but he \ndoes have two state income tax liens in the amount of $5,000. Applicant reached out to \nthe state to enter into a payment agreement a few weeks before the hearing. After the \nhearing, he provided a repayment agreement. He agreed to pay $168 monthly towards \nhis delinquent state tax debt starting on July 19, 2023. His credit card is charged each \nmonth. This debt appears to be from the 2017 tax year. The state filed two tax liens. \nOne lien has a balance of $2,920.03. The other lien has a balance of $5,024.61. (Tr. \n115-116; Gov 9; Gov 10: AE I)   \nThe 2020 delinquent car loan and the state tax liens are not alleged in the SOR. I \nwill not consider them under matters of disqualification. I will consider them for purposes \nof extenuation and mitigation. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to \nassess Applicant\u2019s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is \napplicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; \nto consider whether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of \na whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $7,200. His monthly expenses are \napproximately $5,530. The expenses include $1,700 for child support. The only debts \nhe listed were the debt repayment plan with the law firm for the credit union debt and \nthe state tax lien debt. The total for that amount was $500.00. He listed a net monthly \nremainder of $2,400. However, after subtracting his monthly expenses from his monthly \nincome, Applicant actually has $1,170 remaining each month. (AE K) \nOn June 12, 2023, Applicant completed four online financial courses, including \nRoad Map to Financial Freedom; Identity Theft Protection; Power of Paycheck Planning; \nand Understanding Credit Reports.

Applicant claims the jail time was suspended. He \nwas on probation for three years, which he successfully completed. (Tr. 66-69; Gov 14 \nat 4)   \nUnder cross examination, Applicant testified he was not sure he possessed \nmarijuana during the arrest even though he was initially charged with Possession with \nIntent to Distribute Marijuana. He said the first time he used marijuana was in high \nschool around 1999. The last time he used marijuana was in 2019. He used marijuana \noccasionally at a get togethers or parties. He used marijuana approximately every two \nor three months. When asked if there was a time when he did not use marijuana, \nApplicant testified he did not use marijuana when he was on probation for the 2002 and \n2008 offenses and around 2013-2014. (Tr. 119-121; Gov 2 at 7) Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse was not alleged in the SOR. It will not be considered for disqualification purposes, \nbut will be considered under matters of extenuation and mitigation. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: In May 2007, a temporary restraining order (TRO) was issued \nagainst Applicant.

She also claimed Applicant took her I-Pad and a purse from her home and \npoured motor oil inside her car. Applicant denies this conduct. They did not have a \ncustody agreement. His daughter\u2019s mother has sole custody. Applicant claims he has \nattempted to file for custody, but is unable to because he does not know where the \nmother of his daughter lives. Although he was arrested, the charges were dropped \nbecause his daughter\u2019s mother did not appear on the court date. (Tr. 85-88, 131-133; \nGov 16) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h: In August 2015, a final protective order was issued against Applicant. \nThis involved an altercation with the mother of his son. He approached her at a \nbusiness and confronted her. He began to threaten her and pulled her hair. He \nthreatened to mess her up and kill her. Applicant eventually left the business and drove \naway. He denies pulling her hair and threatening her. (Tr. 89-90, 134-135; Gov 18) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i: In September 2015, Applicant received a citation for Possession of \nDrug Paraphernalia. He states he was pulled over and the police discovered a grinder \nand rolling papers. Applicant admits this. He states he could either pay the fine or show \nup in court to contest the citation. He showed up in court and the case was dismissed. \nHe was not sure if he held a security clearance at the time of this incident. The arrest \nreport indicates the police discovered a silver grinder, a mini bong pipe and 1.5 grams \nof marijuana. On December 7, 2015, Applicant appeared in court. The charges were \nplaced on the STET docket. (Tr. 92, 136; Gov 17) \nSOR \u00b6 2.j: In December 2016, an interim protective order was issued against \nApplicant. This incident involved a woman he had been seeing. In her petition, the \nwoman stated she was Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend. She claimed Applicant verbally and \nphysically assaulted her over a one-year period. She tried to avoid contact with \nApplicant. On December 27, 2016, she was walking to her car around 10:30 pm when \nApplicant jumped out of the bushes and attacked her. She was able to get in her car \nand drive away.

(Gov 1) Applicant testified that this was \nprobably an oversight on his part. He said he was in a rush to complete his e-QIP \napplication.

Have you EVER illegally used or otherwise been \nillegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance other than previously listed?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and is alleged to have \ndeliberately failed to disclose his 2015 citation as set forth in SOR \u00b6 2.i, above, or his \npossession of marijuana when he was arrested in November 2008 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.d, above. Applicant testified that this was probably an oversight on his part. He said \nhe was in a rush to complete his e-QIP application. He indicates that he did list the more \nsevere felony charge. (Tr. 93- 98; Gov 1) \nI find for Applicant with regard to SOR \u00b6 2.l. My basis for doing so is there no \ninformation in the record that indicates Applicant possessed an active security \nclearance at the time of his felony arrest in 2008 or in 2015 when he received a citation \nfor possession of drug paraphernalia. There is no evidence indicating Applicant was \ngranted access to classified information other than his own assertions. While he worked \nas a contractor for government agencies, no information has been provided regarding \nwhether he held an active security clearance in the past. In addition, Applicant listed the \n2008 felony charge and conviction in response to section 22 \u2013 Police Record on the \nsame May 2018 security clearance application, which provided adequate notice to the \ngovernment regarding this arrest and conviction. (Gov 1 at 28) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony during the hearing, that he used marijuana on occasion, \nevery three of four months since he was in high school up to 2019, raises additional \nfalsification concerns regarding his answer on his May 4, 2018, security clearance \napplication.

During the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted to occasional marijuana use beginning in high school to 2019. There were \ntimes he did not use marijuana. Within the past 7 years, he testified he did not use \nmarijuana in 2013-2014. Apparently, he used marijuana illegally on numerous \noccasions between May 2011 to 2013 and from 2015 to 2019. He used marijuana \nbefore and after submitting his May 2018 security clearance application. While \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his marijuana use in response to the Section 23 question \nabove, is not alleged in the SOR, it will be considered under matters of extenuation and \nmitigation. \nCharacter Reference  \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a reference letter on his behalf. He states \nApplicant \u201cconsistently demonstrates a remarkable work ethic and commitment to his \nresponsibilities.\u201d He is always willing to take on additional tasks whenever needed. \nApplicant consistently displays honesty, dependability, and follows organizational \npolicies and guidelines. He is meticulous when following security protocols, which \nsignificantly contributed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of sensitive \ninformation within the organization. His supervisor believes Applicant\u2019s retention of his \nsecurity clearance would be within the best interest of the organization. (AE D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nWith regard to DOD policy on marijuana use, the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014, memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts, including two car repossessions, a \nconsumer loan, and three delinquent child support accounts. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing \nand recent. He only recently began to resolve several of his delinquent debts. Most of \nthe delinquent debts remain unresolved. After the SOR was issued, Applicant had \nanother car loan charged off. He also had two unresolved state tax liens. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant encountered periods of unemployment in \nthe past. He also recently separated from his wife. Circumstances beyond his control \nadversely affected his finances. This mitigating condition is given less weight because I \ncannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Since 2017, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had two cars repossessed. He recently had another automobile loan charged \noff in February 2023. While Applicant appears to be attempting to resolve his delinquent \nchild support accounts, he provided insufficient documentation to show his efforts to \nresolve the delinquent child support for both his son and his daughter. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies because Applicant attended and completed several \non-line financial counseling courses. However, he completed these courses about a \nweek before the hearing and his attempts to resolve his delinquent debt is too recent to \nconclude this his financial situation is being resolved or is under control. At the close of \nthe record, Applicant had significant unresolved delinquent debt to include three \nautomobile repossessions and an unresolved child support situation involving his two \nchildren. As a result, AG \u00b6 20(c) is given less weight. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. There is \nsufficient evidence to conclude this debt is resolved. Partial credit is given for \nApplicant\u2019s entry into a repayment agreement for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and \nthere is evidence that some child support is being deducted from his paycheck. He also \nentered into a repayment agreement for the unalleged state tax liens. I cannot give full \ncredit for this mitigating condition because the repayment agreements began after the \nhearing was held and the documentation is insufficient to determine the history of \npayments and current status of his children\u2019s child support cases. \nApplicant did not meet his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations. He has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that his \ndelinquent debts are being resolved or under control. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA \nAppeals Board has repeatedly held that, to establish his case in mitigation, an applicant \nmust present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt \nreduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an \napplicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant \nmust show that he has a plan for debt resolution and has taken significant action to \nimplement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). \nFrom the record presented, Applicant has no plan in place and furnished no evidence, \nexcept for his recent entry into payment plans for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and the \nunalleged state tax liens. After a full review of the entire record from an overall common-\nsense point of view, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts that were charged \noff on his May 2018 security clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.k \nwith respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e and 1.h. \nPersonal Conduct concerns are raised because of Applicant\u2019s history of criminal \noffenses and citations from 2002 to 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, 2.e, 2.g, and 2.i) Applicant \nalso had four protective orders issued against him in 2007, 2012, 2015, and 2016. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.f, 2.h, and 2.j). While it has been years since Applicant\u2019s last criminal offense \nand last temporary protective order, his long history of offenses raises questions about \nhis judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations which indicate Applicant may not properly safeguard classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nAs noted in the Facts section above, SOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation, and as to \nSOR \u00b6 2.l, falsification is not established. These allegations are found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his \ndelinquent and charged-off debts on his May 2018 security clearance application. \nApplicant did not volunteer this information until he was confronted about the debts. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because of Applicant\u2019s history of felony gun \nconvictions, his marijuana-related offenses, and his history of misconduct, which \nresulted in persons in his life filing temporary protective orders against him on several \noccasions. Concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness also remain \nbecause of his history of marijuana use up to 2019 and his failure to disclose his \nmarijuana use within the past 7 years when submitting his May 2018 security clearance \napplication. While not alleged, Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his marijuana use on his \nMay 2018 security clearance application and his continued use of marijuana until 2019, \nafter submitting his security clearance application shows a disregard for the rules and \ncasts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment as a DOD contractor, the favorable reference from his \nsupervisor, his IT certifications, and his attendance at financial counseling courses. I \nhave incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b - 2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Each subsequent year after the fifth year, the business was required to incrementally increase obtaining government contracts on its own. In year six, the program required the business to obtain 20% of its own contracts, year seven 30%, year eight 40%, year nine 50% and then the company would graduate from the program and be solely responsible for obtaining its own contracts. The business had reporting requirements to the government.

He holds two associate degrees earned in 2000 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree earned in 2014. He also holds numerous computer certifications. He \nnever married. He has five minor children.

The business had reporting \nrequirements to the government. (Tr. 22, 35-36,56-57; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant testified that he is the sole owner of the company and is its president and \nchief executive officer. He receives an annual salary from the business of $170,000. It is \na Subchapter S corporation. He has a contracted facility security officer (FSO). He \nexplained that under a Subchapter S corporation, he files his business tax returns first \nthen his personal income tax returns. He receives an IRS Form K-1 from the company, \nwhich reflects the profit from his business, for which he is the recipient as the sole owner. \nIt was requested that Applicant provide copies of IRS Form K-1 for the past five years. \nHe did not provide the documents. In 2022, his company grossed approximately $6 \nmillion. Applicant testified that since 2011 he has not had a good grasp on understanding \nhis taxable income.

(Tr. 92-103) \nApplicant testified that when he started his business, he had a woman in the \nneighborhood prepare his tax returns. He said everyone in the area had her complete \ntheir returns. Although she worked for H & R Block, she completed people\u2019s tax returns \noutside of her employment. Sometime after he filed his 2011 tax return, the IRS contacted \nApplicant and asked him if he had a barn that burned down. He learned that this woman \nwas making fraudulent claims on his tax returns. He credibly testified that he never \nintentionally meant to mislead the IRS. He said that the IRS told him to hire a certified \npublic accountant to prepare his tax returns. This woman had filed his 2009, 2010, and \n2011 income tax returns. (Tr. 48-53) \nIn 2012, Applicant hired accounting firm KK who completed his tax returns for tax \nyears 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. He stopped using them after tax year 2015 when they \nadvised him that his company was getting too big for their expertise with all of the \ngovernment reporting requirements and financial aspects of the business. Applicant said \nthat his business and personal income tax returns were combined. (Tr. 53, 57) \nApplicant testified that in 2015 he hired another certified public accounting firm, IA, \nto handle his tax returns and the government reporting requirements for the business. He \nreceived tax advice from Mr. H of IA. Applicant testified that in 2017, he became aware \nthat previous tax years\u2019 returns were filed late and penalties and interest were incurred \nthat Applicant was responsible to pay. He said he was unaware why this happened \nbecause his accountant had the documents he needed to timely file. Mr. H was working \nwith the IRS to potentially have the penalties for his late filings waived. Applicant testified \nhe never saw a waiver request that was sent to the IRS. He said he was making periodic \nlump-sum payments to reduce his tax liabilities. (Tr. 57-73, 85-86) \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax transcript for tax year 2016 shows that someone was \ncommunicating with the IRS on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant testified that he and Mr. H \nmet with the IRS representative a couple of times in 2017 and multiple times after 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 income tax return was filed in August 2019. Applicant testified that he \ndid not know the return was filed late because Mr. H had all of the documents to timely \nfile. Applicant said he asked Mr. H how to resolve his tax problems, and he was advised \nto make lump-sum payments towards his delinquent taxes. His tax transcript from tax \nyear 2020 shows he had $95,457 withheld for taxes during the year, which was then \napplied to tax debts for years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Applicant testified that IA had access \nto all his financial information that was stored on a software program, and they had their \nown bookkeeper who was responsible for Applicant\u2019s account. Tax transcripts show he \ndid make periodic lump-sum payments to the IRS. (Tr. 62-73; AE D, G, H, I) \nApplicant stated that when he completed his security clearance application (SCA) \nin February 2017, he asked his FSO and Mr. H whether he needed to disclose his failure \nto timely file and pay his past income taxes and whether he was currently delinquent on \nany federal debt. He said he was told by Mr. H that he did not need to disclose he was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent because he was making payments to the IRS and was under an installment \nagreement.

(Tr. 75, 83-86) \nApplicant testified that he then hired a tax accountant to file his 2020 and 2021 \nincome tax returns. He also had his own bookkeeper, who managed the corporate books, \nprovide the financial information to the tax accountant. In December 2022, Applicant hired \na new accounting firm who is now responsible for all of Applicant\u2019s tax returns. He has \nsigned a power of attorney for the firm to help him resolve his tax issues with the IRS. He \nmeets with his accountant quarterly to ensure he is ahead of any potential issues.

His November 2019 tax transcript for tax year 2008 reports an \ninstallment agreement was established in May 2013 and payments of $200 were made \nuntil September 2017 and applied to his 2008 delinquent taxes. An offer-in-compromise \nwas made to the IRS in September 2017 and withdrawn in January 2018. (Tr. 132-133; \nGE 2) \nA letter from his accountant dated November 11, 2019, was provided that stated \nthat Applicant\u2019s 2018 federal income tax had not been filed because the current \naccountant was waiting for documents from his previous accountant; a balance of \n$317,970 was owed at that time to the IRS; they were in the process of requesting \ninformation and waiting for the IRS to appoint a revenue agent to provide them documents \nregarding a fraud determination on Applicant\u2019s 2009 and 2010 returns; and that an \ninstallment agreement was not in place, but his account was flagged to show an \ninstallment agreement was being discussed and waiting for the assignment of a revenue \nagent. (AE U) \nApplicant provided a copy of an installment agreement with the IRS from January \n2022, which notes he owes $266,548. It provides for him to pay $500 a month towards \nhis balance that includes tax years 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He has been \nmaking payments that have been applied to his delinquent tax debts. Tax transcripts show \nhe made other payments towards his tax debt in the past, sometimes lump-sum \npayments. Applicant\u2019s November 2019 tax transcript for tax year 2008 reflected Applicant \nowed $17,393. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he paid his 2008 \ndelinquent federal taxes. I do not have a current 2008 tax transcript, but based on the \ninstallment agreement, it is likely any outstanding debt from 2008 would have been \nincluded. The most current tax transcript I have for tax year 2010 is from November 2019 \nand it shows an outstanding balance owed of $64,219. However, using the same logic as \nthe 2008 balance owed, this tax year would also likely have been included in the \ninstallment agreement if it was still owed.

(AE P, Q, R, S, U, V) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was indebted to the IRS for failing to timely pay his 2008, 2009, 2010, \n2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal income taxes. He failed to timely file his 2011, \n2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 federal income tax returns. He has three unresolved \nfederal tax liens. He had four state tax liens. Three were resolved, one remains. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a long history of tax problems. Some of his tax problems could be \nattributed to being inexperienced in his business pursuits. Applicant testified that in 2011 \nhe was told by the IRS that there was questionable information reported on his tax returns \nand he needed to hire a professional. He hired accountants to complete his tax returns. \nThere is insufficient evidence that he actively confirmed that his taxes were being filed on \ntime. This was his personal responsibility regardless of who he relied on to prepare his \ntax returns. Through his testimony, it was clear that Applicant did not and perhaps still \ndoes not know what his tax obligations are regarding his business. To some extent he \ncan blame his accountants, but he is ultimately responsible to file on time and pay what \nis owed.

He did not provide a copy of the agreement, but \ndid provide proof he was making payments. I have considered that at different times he \nhas made large lump-sums payments to reduce his delinquent tax debts. I have \nconsidered that he was making consistent small monthly payments towards his 2008 tax \ndebt. I have also considered that for many years he clearly was aware that he had tax \nissues and failed to timely file and pay his taxes. In January 2022 he established an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS to pay $500 a month on his large tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies to resolving his tax debt for 2008 and 2010. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). His tax returns \nfor tax years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been filed and taxes paid for \n2014 and 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i). AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to those years \nfiled and paid. \nApplicant\u2019s 2008 taxes appear to be paid. Based on his January 2022 installment \nagreement with the IRS he is still paying his 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 \nfederal income taxes that are part of his installment agreement. His delinquent debts are \nongoing. I am not confident at this juncture that Applicant has a handle on his finances \nand that future problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply \nEvidence supports that Applicant relied on his accountants to file his federal \nincome tax returns. He claimed he was unaware they were not being timely filed. \nHowever, as early as 2012 he was aware he had tax liens and was attempting to resolve \nthem. Accountants prepare tax returns, but it is the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility to sign the \nreturn, file it, and pay what may be owed. It was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that \neach year the tax returns were filed. Perhaps initially he could attribute the failure to timely \nfile to being unaware, but the evidence shows he was on notice and had a responsibility \nif he did not receive the required tax returns from his accountant, to contact them. Each \nyear he failed to act timely and responsibly, which then exacerbated his tax situation. \nAlthough some of Applicant\u2019s tax issues may have been beyond his control early on when \nhe was just starting in his business, it is also clear that later he did not address the \nproblems and act responsibly to resolve them. Making lump-sum payments without \nfiguring out his obligations may have lessened his tax burden, but it did not prevent the \nproblems from recurring. Arranging an installment agreement with the IRS in 2012 and \nthen failing to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes show he did not act responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant provided a document post-hearing to show he completed the financial \ncounseling provided through the bankruptcy court. Although this shows that post-hearing, \nApplicant is making an effort to understand his finances, it is insufficient to conclude that \nthere are clear indications that his financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) has \nminimal application. \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had federal and state tax liens. Liens are an \nenforcement mechanism. The actual tax debts are alleged separately in the SOR. \nTherefore, the lien allegations are duplicitous, and I find for Applicant regarding these \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.J, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m.) SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges both the state tax debt and \nunreleased lien. He has not mitigated that allegation. \nApplicant is participating in an IRS installment agreement and making monthly \npayments towards his federal tax debt. Throughout the years he has made some lump-\nsum payments to decrease his tax debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) has some application. \nThere is some mitigation under the financial considerations guideline, but due to \nthe many years that Applicant failed to timely file and pay his federal taxes, his \noutstanding federal and state tax liens, his large delinquent tax debt, and the fact that he \nwas on notice early that he had tax issues, but failed to take corrective actions and \npurchased a luxury vehicle in 2020, show his lack of judgment and unreliability in being \nfinancially responsible, I cannot conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nThe SOR alleged that the IRS determined Applicant committed fraud in the \npreparation of his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010.

There was no other evidence provided regarding the \nfraud allegations. Although, there may be some evidence of tax fraud for 2008, it is \ninsufficient to show Applicant\u2019s intent. I conclude for Applicant for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant completed an SCA in February 2017. The SOR was amended to reflect \nallegations of falsification on a 2020 SCA, which was not offered or admitted into \nevidence. I find for Applicant for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to timely file and pay his federal income taxes for many years. He \ncontinues to have a significant delinquent tax debt, federal tax liens and a state tax lien. \nDespite the amount he owes the IRS, he recently purchased a luxury vehicle. Applicant \nhas not met his burden of persuasion. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board also has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

(Item 4 at 4, 7) \nApplicant reported in her SCA that, in 2017, while she was still on active duty in \nthe Army, she received an Article 15 for misusing her Government credit card. She did \nnot disclose any debts in her SCA and told the investigator that she was not aware of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR as she thought she was doing well financially. In her Answer to \nthe SOR and response to the FORM, she indicated that she did not intentionally falsify \nher SCA. (Item 2 at 2-3; Item 3; Item 7 at 3, 10-13; AE A) \nApplicant provided a letter of recommendation in her response to the FORM from \na senior colonel who has supervised her since June 2021. He finds her to be \u201ca paragon \nof integrity and character,\u201d who has \u201cunequivocally demonstrated a history of honesty, \ndiscretion, reliability, sound judgment, strength of character, trustworthiness, and loyalty \nto this great Nation.\u201d (AE H) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $71,000 in delinquent debt. She provided documentation that \ndemonstrated resolution of one credit-card debt. The auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o is a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Based upon the totality of the evidence in the \nrecord, I find that the $122 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is mitigated. However, she \nfailed to provide any evidence that she has contacted any of creditors of the debts alleged \nin SOR 1.a through 1.l, or 1.n to establish payment arrangements. Nor has she provided \ndocumentation to demonstrate that she has resolved those debts or is not responsible for \nthose debts. \nI considered that Applicant is a single mother, experienced a short period of \nunemployment following her honorable discharge from the Army, and has a son with \nnumerous and significant medical issues. However, the record is absent any evidence of \nan effort by her to resolve her debts or prove that the outstanding debts are not her \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient that she has acted responsibly to resolve \nher financial issues. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve her existing debts and the new delinquent debts in \nher August 2022 CBR, indicate her financial issues are an ongoing and continuing \nconcern. Therefore, her behavior continues to cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She has not provided sufficient evidence of a good-\nfaith effort to repay or resolve her delinquent debts. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward \nbenefits \nor \nstatus, \ndetermine \nnational \nsecurity \neligibility \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmind at the time of the omission. (See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2004) An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are relevant to \ndetermining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance was \ndeliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010)) \nIn this case, Applicant denied the allegation in her Answer. She failed to disclose \ndelinquent debts in her 2018 SCA. During her December 2018 interview with an \ninvestigator, she expressed surprise that she had numerous delinquent debts as she was \nunder the impression that they had been resolved. She reiterated these claims in her \nAnswer and response to the FORM. \nI find that the record does not demonstrate sufficient evidence of Applicant \nintentionally, deliberately concealing, or falsifying her SCA. Additionally, her disclosure in \nher SCA of her 2017 Article 15 for misuse of her government credit card reflects her \nwillingness to voluntarily to disclose derogatory personal information that could negatively \naffect her ability to obtain or retain a security clearance. Therefore, the Guideline E \nsecurity concerns are decided for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service, her glowing letter of recommendation from a senior military \nofficer, and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of \nproof and persuasion. She did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns \nor establish her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 28-year-old, married man with one child. He has a high school education and has been working for the past seven years as a sheet metal worker for a ship building company. (Tr. 26) He was recently promoted to foreman. (Tr. 21) He has held a security clearance since 2015. (Tr. 16) Applicant used marijuana up to four days per week from about 2011 to 2018. (GE 2 at 6) During the last three years of his marijuana use, he held a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana led to two arrests. Specifically, in June 2014, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty and was placed on probation for six months and ordered to perform 24 hours of community service. (GE 2 at 7) As part of his probation, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. Applicant successfully completed the probation. In 2016, a police officer pulled over Applicant\u2019s automobile when he noticed that his inspection sticker had expired. When the officer spoke to Applicant, he noticed that the car smelled like marijuana, prompting him to search it. After noticing a small mason jar filled with marijuana, the officer arrested Applicant and charged him with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. (Item 2 at 8; Tr. 23) A few months later, the court deferred judgment for six months and placed Applicant on probation during that time.

The CAF took \nthe action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn September 15, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2022. On \nDecember 12, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nstatement of videoteleconference hearing, scheduling the case for January 10, 2023. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I considered four Government exhibits, marked \nand incorporated into the record as Government Exhibit (GE) 1 to GE 4. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on January 25, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 28-year-old, married man with one child. He has a high school \neducation and has been working for the past seven years as a sheet metal worker for a \nship building company. (Tr. 26) He was recently promoted to foreman. (Tr. 21) He has held \na security clearance since 2015. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant used marijuana up to four days per week from about 2011 to 2018. (GE 2 \nat 6) During the last three years of his marijuana use, he held a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana led to two arrests. Specifically, in June 2014, he was arrested \nand charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty \nand was placed on probation for six months and ordered to perform 24 hours of community \nservice. (GE 2 at 7) As part of his probation, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six \nmonths. Applicant successfully completed the probation. \nIn 2016, a police officer pulled over Applicant\u2019s automobile when he noticed that his \ninspection sticker had expired. When the officer spoke to Applicant, he noticed that the car \nsmelled like marijuana, prompting him to search it. After noticing a small mason jar filled \nwith marijuana, the officer arrested Applicant and charged him with misdemeanor \npossession of marijuana. (Item 2 at 8; Tr. 23) A few months later, the court deferred \njudgment for six months and placed Applicant on probation during that time. While on \nprobation, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was to perform 32 hours of \ncommunity service, complete random drug tests, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted. \n(GE 4 at 2) Applicant did not complete the community services hours as ordered, and he \nfailed two random drug tests. His non-compliance with the terms of probation prompted the \ncourt to find him guilty of the charge. (GE 2 at 8) \nOne evening in March 2017, while driving home from a party where he had been \ndrinking alcohol, Applicant fell asleep at the wheel after stopping at a red light. The driver of \nthe car behind Applicant\u2019s car exited his vehicle and knocked on Applicant\u2019s driver-side \nwindow. When Applicant did not awaken, the driver of the other car called the fire \ndepartment. When a fire truck arrived, the firefighters knocked on the window, then broke it \nafter Applicant did not respond. Applicant still did not wake up. By the time Applicant woke \nup, a police officer had arrived and administered a breathalyzer, which he failed. Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (GE 2 at 9) \nAfter pleading guilty to the offense, Applicant was fined $500, ordered to complete alcohol \nand drug counseling, attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, required to install an \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nignition interlock device for a period of six months, and sentenced to 30 days\u2019 incarceration \n(suspended). (Answer at 2) Applicant complied with the requirements of the court order. \n(Tr. 25) \nApplicant reduced his alcohol consumption significantly after the DUI arrest. Now, he \ndrinks approximately three drinks per month. (Item 2 at 7) Applicant has not used marijuana \nsince December 2018, and no longer associates with his friends who use marijuana. (Item \n2 at 6) He attributes his use to immaturity, acknowledged that he was \u201cin the wrong,\u201d and \ntestified that it \u201cdidn\u2019t register that [he] would have future issues,\u201d if he continued to use \nmarijuana.\u201d (Tr. 28) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2018. He \nunderreported his use of marijuana, estimating that he had used it a few times between \nAugust 2011 and December 2012, when in fact he was using it occasionally at the time he \ncompleted the application. (Answer at 2; Tr. 30) Applicant also falsified his answer to the \nquestion asking about drug use while possessing a security clearance by answering \u201cNo,\u201d \nand failed to disclose his marijuana use within that context. (Answer at 3) Applicant admits \nthese allegations, explaining that he was \u201cscared and . . . overthinking\u201d when he completed \nthe application. In response to a question concerning whether he would ever use any \nmarijuana in the future, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t intend on using this substance EVER \n[emphasis provided by Applicant] because I am an employee at the [company].\u201d (Tr. 34) He \ncontinued to use marijuana for approximately one month after completing the security \nclearance application. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing\nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance,\nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are\nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number\nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel[.]\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder AG \u00b6 24, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, including his use after being granted access to \nclassified information triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and \n25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions set forth under AG \u00b6 26 apply are potentially \napplicable, as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; [and] \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; [and] \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. \nApplicant readily admits that his use of marijuana was foolish and irresponsible. He \nhas not used marijuana in more than four years and no longer associates with his friends \nwho use marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are applicable \nAlthough Applicant has not used marijuana in more than four years, he used it for \nthree years while granted access to classified information, and for one month after he \ncompleted security clearance application in which he emphatically stated he would not use \nit in the future. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable, and any positive security inference generated \nby the passage of time since the last use is outweighed by the seriousness of his \nmisconduct. I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security \nconcern. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, . . . calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of marijuana and alcohol-related arrests triggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \n\u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of \nofficial record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally \ncharged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant has not used marijuana in more than four years. He is now married and \nhas a child. At work, he was recently promoted to foreman. Conversely, he did not comply \nwith the terms of probation for his most recent marijuana-related arrest. Moreover, he \ncontinued to use marijuana for a month after completing the security clearance application \nafter explicitly stating on that application that he would never use it again. Consequently, \nAG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, with terms of parole or \nprobation, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement,\u201d applies, but AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment,\u201d does not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admits intentionally falsifying a 2018 security clearance application by \nunderreporting his marijuana use and denying ever using it while possessing a security \nclearance. Consequently, AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant has matured over the past few years since he completed the security \nclearance application. Moreover, his testimony was both sincere and contrite. However, \ngiven the seriousness of his conduct, particularly using marijuana for up to one month after \ncompleting the security clearance application, his use while possessing a security \nclearance, and his security clearance application falsifications, it is too soon to conclude he \nhas mitigated the Guideline E security concerns. I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s misconduct outweighs the passage of \ntime and the maturation he has experienced since he last used marijuana. Consequently, it \nis too soon to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 51 years old. He came to the United States from his native country in April 1991, after graduating from high school and attending college for one year. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1995, and served four years on active duty, followed by four years in the Inactive Reserve. From October 1999 to October 2003, he worked as an architectural drafter for a laboratory design firm. During that time he also earned a two- year associate\u2019s degree in Architecture from a community college. He enlisted in the Army in October 2003, and served honorably until he retired from active duty as a geospatial engineer staff sergeant (E-6) on November 1, 2019. He and his first wife married in April 1997 and divorced in November 2015. They have three daughters, one of whom is 36 years old and graduated from college. He continues to pay child support for the other two daughters. He married his second wife in 2017, and they have a six-year-old daughter. (GE 1; AE C; AE D; Tr. 37-39, 76-77, 111-112.) Applicant held security clearances during his time on active duty and is seeking a security clearance to enable his potential employment as a civilian geospatial analyst. On April 2, 2019, while he was still on active duty, the DoD CAF issued him a Letter of Intent to revoke his national security eligibility, including an SOR citing financial concerns under Guideline F and personal conduct concerns under Guideline E.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on July 21, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s employer deployed him to the Middle East in early August 2021. After \ncoordination with Applicant\u2019s counsel, DOHA issued a Notice of Video Teleconference \nHearing on April 22, 2022, setting the hearing for May 5, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. Applicant objected to GE 2, which \nwas not admitted, and to GE 7, which was admitted for a limited purpose. GE 1 and 3 \nthrough 6 were admitted without objection. (Tr. 19-26.) Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through X into evidence. Department Counsel noted that AE N \nwas a duplicate of the first page of AE O addressing SOR \u00b6 1.q, not evidence concerning \nSOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant subsequently submitted AE Z to correct this clerical error. \nDepartment Counsel also objected to AE X, which was admitted for limited purposes as \ndemonstrative evidence. All other exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 27-36.) I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until June 15, 2022, to permit \nsubmission of additional evidence. He timely submitted AE Y, Z, and AA, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 51 years old. He came to the United States from his native country in \nApril 1991, after graduating from high school and attending college for one year. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1995, and served four years on active duty, followed \nby four years in the Inactive Reserve. From October 1999 to October 2003, he worked as \nan architectural drafter for a laboratory design firm. During that time he also earned a two-\nyear associate\u2019s degree in Architecture from a community college. He enlisted in the Army \nin October 2003, and served honorably until he retired from active duty as a geospatial \nengineer staff sergeant (E-6) on November 1, 2019. He and his first wife married in April \n1997 and divorced in November 2015. They have three daughters, one of whom is 36 \nyears old and graduated from college. He continues to pay child support for the other two \ndaughters. He married his second wife in 2017, and they have a six-year-old daughter. \n(GE 1; AE C; AE D; Tr. 37-39, 76-77, 111-112.) \nApplicant held security clearances during his time on active duty and is seeking a \nsecurity clearance to enable his potential employment as a civilian geospatial analyst. On \nApril 2, 2019, while he was still on active duty, the DoD CAF issued him a Letter of Intent \nto revoke his national security eligibility, including an SOR citing financial concerns under \nGuideline F and personal conduct concerns under Guideline E. That SOR alleged that \nhis September 7, 2016 credit bureau report included 21 delinquent debts totaling over \n$156,000; and that he failed to disclose them by answering, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question on his \nAugust 2016 security clearance application that asked whether he had any financial \ndelinquencies. Applicant answered that LOI, but then applied to retire from the Army when \nhe reached 20 years of service on November 1, 2019.

Two of the debts involved the first and second \nmortgages on Applicant\u2019s former home; ten were student loan accounts placed for \ncollection; and the others were consumer credit, medical, and car loan delinquencies. \nTheir existence was documented in credit bureau reports from September 2016, \nSeptember 2019, June 2021, and April 2022. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b: Applicant and his first wife bought a home for $217,000 in \n2004 and took out a $70,000 second mortgage in 2006. His September 2019 credit report \nshowed that the first mortgage was delinquent in the amount of $4,181 (2 monthly \npayments plus fees) with a then-outstanding balance of $174,061; and that the lender \nhad charged off the second mortgage with a delinquent balance due of $52,197. This \naccount was charged off in March 2016 after Applicant stopped making payments on that \nloan in July 2015. He was one to five months late on payments toward the first mortgage \nfrom October 2018 to April 2020, according to his June 2021 and April 2022 credit reports. \nApplicant sold the home in September 2020, and used the proceeds to pay off these \ndelinquent loans. (Answer; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE I; AE J; Tr. 47-50, 79-83.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.l: Applicant obtained two $12,500 student loans, while on active \nduty in December 2008 and April 2009, to pay for computer animation classes he took \nfrom an online art institute. He testified that animation is a hobby he loves, and he wanted \nto obtain a degree and explore it as a post-Army career field. These were Federal Direct \nStudent Loans, in which the U.S. Government is the lender, not a private financial \ninstitution. He testified that he chose not to repay these loans because he was unsatisfied \nwith the quality of the instruction he received over the two years he took these classes. \nHis September 2019 credit report stated that both loans were assigned to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (ED) in a collection status, with a combined $22,514 balance \ndue, after each became delinquent in April 2013. His September 2022 credit report \nshowed one combined ED Direct student loan outstanding balance of $23,069 with no \nscheduled payments, apparently under the COVID-related suspended collection policy. \nApplicant said that he recently delayed paying these loans while he figured out whether \nthey had been consolidated with his other private student loans, discussed below. His \ntestimony evinced confusion concerning the status of his numerous outstanding student \nloans, which he admitted became delinquent due to his extended failure to pay them as \nrequired. (GE 4; GE 6; AE K; Tr. 50-56, 59-61, 64-66, 83-92, 112-114.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f to1.j, 1.n, and 1.o: From July 2006 to January 2008, Applicant \nobtained eight Stafford student loans, originally totaling $37,426. These were Federally \nguaranteed loans issued by banks or other financial institutions.

In any event, he acknowledged that these loans were \nlegitimately his obligations. Applicant\u2019s September 2019 credit report showed that all \nthese loans had been placed for collection after becoming delinquent in April or May 2013, \nwith a combined balance due of $68,737. On his April 2022 credit report, the combined \nbalance due to the current loan servicing company had increased to $74,747. It showed \nthe loans to be in a \u2018deferred\u2019 status until April 2023, also apparently under the \nGovernment\u2019s suspended collection policy for student loan debtors. Applicant submitted \nsome evidence of sporadic payments under agreements to begin repaying these loans, \nbut nothing showing consistent repayment compliance. (Answer; GE 4; GE 6; AE K; Tr. \n55-56, 59-61, 77-78, 83-92, 112-114, 120-121.) \nStudent Loan Consolidation: Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission of evidence\nincluded a May 20, 2022 letter from the student loan management/collection agency \nagreeing to consolidate all ten of his delinquent student loans into one loan, with \npayments scheduled to begin 60 days thereafter. The letter directed him to continue \nmaking required monthly payments on his existing loans until receiving written notification \nthat they had been successfully consolidated. The outstanding balance on the new loan, \nafter consolidation of the ten loans discussed above, is to be $97,852.61, and he will owe \n360 monthly payments of $618.50. The total interest charges will be $124,807.30, with \ntotal repayments of $222,660 over the next 30 years. He also submitted a payment history \nfrom the collection agency showing that he made no payments toward these loans \nbetween August 1, 2012, and May 31, 2021. During 2021 he made four payments totaling \n$2,050; and he made two additional $550 payments after his hearing, in May and June \n2022. His loan consolidation appears to have been executed on June 10, 2022. (AE Y.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: In July 2019, Applicant had a $269 past-due balance on a car loan he \nopened in April 2016 to purchase a 2010 BMW for $18,399. The loan was for five years \nwith monthly payments of $480, and he had paid it down to $11,273 by July 2019. His \nJune 2021 credit report shows that from August 2017 to July 2019 he was one- or two-\nmonths delinquent in paying this loan 18 times, and made current payments 6 times. He \ntestified that his payments were late because the seller did not pay for some engine \nrepairs he thought should have been covered under the contract, and he paid for the \nrepairs instead of paying the loan. In July 2019 the loan was transferred to another \ncreditor, and in April 2021 Applicant accepted a debt consolidation loan offer from a \ndifferent finance company. He used some of those funds to pay off the former creditor on \nthis loan, and his payments to the latest lender are current. (Answer; GE 4; GE 5; AE L; \nTr. 55-56, 92-94.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m: Applicant obtained two credit cards from a credit union in \n1999 and 2007, with limits of $8,000 and $7,000 respectively. He stopped making \npayments on both accounts in April 2015, and they were charged off and closed with \noutstanding balances of $7,543 and $7,138 as of August 2019. His June 2021 credit \nreport stated that these accounts were being paid under a partial payment agreement, \nwith each balance having been reduced by $10, and last payments made in November \n2020.

No \ncorroborating evidence of this agreement, or of subsequent payments, was provided. \n(Answer; GE 4; GE 5; AE M; Tr. 61-64, 94-97, 109-110.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: A collection agency reported, in August 2019, that Applicant owed \n$3,013 in past-due payments on a cell phone account that the agency had acquired in \nDecember 2018. Applicant\u2019s last payment on this debt had been made in February 2016. \nApplicant claimed in his Answer, without documentation, that he completed paying a \nsettlement agreement with this creditor on September 30, 2020. He testified that he paid \noff the debt in October 2020, for $602. He explained that he originally didn\u2019t pay the cell \nphone company because he thought that roaming charges from calls while he was \ndeployed to the Middle East were excessive. His settlement of the alleged debt is \nsupported by the absence of this account from his June 2021 and April 2022 credit \nreports. (Answer; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 66-68, 97-99.) \nApplicant opened another cell phone account with the same company in October \n2020. That account also became delinquent and was placed for collection. Applicant \nexplained that he did not make contractual payments on this new account because he \nthought that he should have been provided a better new phone than the one he received \nfrom the company under the contract. He provided documentation from the collection \nagency stating that on May 25, 2022, per his authorization, a $253 payment would be \nprocessed from his credit card or checking account toward the $1,192 balance due on \nthis delinquent cell phone account with the same service provider. (Answer; AE Z; Tr. 66-\n68, 97-99.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: Applicant opened this automobile loan in March 2018, to purchase a \n2009 used car for his second wife. Applicant testified that the car kept breaking down, so \nhe decided to \u201creturn\u201d it rather than make the required monthly payments. The lender \nrepossessed the car and charged off the $2,579 balance due in January 2019. Applicant \nacknowledged his responsibility to pay this debt. His June 2021 credit report reflected no \npayments since 2018, but he submitted a June 6, 2021 account statement from the \ncreditor stating that a $129 post-dated payment was scheduled to be deposited on June \n15, 2021, toward the new total due of $2,908. His April 2022 credit report showed a \nreduced balance of $1,579 outstanding, with a last payment made in September 2021. \nHe testified that he had reached a new settlement agreement in April 2022, under which \nhe would not be charged additional interest if he paid off the debt within six months, and \nhe made a $100 payment toward the debt on April 21, 2022. (Answer; GE4; GE 5; GE 6; \nAE O; Tr. 68-70, 100-101.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.r: Applicant opened this $1,779 credit card account in 2002.

(Answer; GE 4; AE P; Tr. 70-71, 101-103, 110-111.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.s: Applicant opened this credit card account in July 2008. He testified that \nhe used it for online purchases from iTunes. He stopped paying the account in June 2016 \nbecause of what he described as a communication issue concerning billing, and the \ncreditor charged off the $363 balance due. He settled this debt for less than the full \nbalance with one $163 payment on October 5, 2020. (GE 4; GE 6; AE Q; Tr. 71-72.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: Applicant failed to pay a $297 medical debt in February 2017, and it \nwas placed for collection with a balance-due of $337 in October 2017. Applicant claimed \nthat, after initially disputing this debt, he paid it off. He provided a copy of an undated \nbank checking account statement that showed a pending $273.44 point of sale debit to a \nmedical debt collection agency. Applicant wrote on this copy that he had two medical \ncollection accounts for $94 and $248 that he settled for this $273.44 amount. The bill \nattached to this exhibit says that the service dates for these two debts were in January \nand March 2021, not in 2017. No evidence corroborates that the $337 collection account \nwas resolved by this payment, although it does not appear on either his 2021 or 2022 \ncredit reports. (Answer; GE 4; AE R; Tr. 72.) \nApplicant testified that he owed more than $5,000 in unpaid Federal income taxes \nthat apparently became delinquent due to under-withholding from wages he earned while \nworking in the Middle East during 2019 and 2020. He was laid off and returned to the \nUnited States before qualifying to exclude his earnings from his taxable income. This \nunpaid balance remained after an unspecified amount from Applicant\u2019s refund from his \n2021 tax return was applied toward the debt. He said that he was making monthly \npayments to the IRS, but that his last such payment had been two or three months before \nhis hearing. No documentation concerning this tax debt was submitted. (Tr. 104-106.) \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement stating that, to the best of his \nknowledge, his and his spouse\u2019s gross monthly income was $13,443; and their net \nincome after taxes and a $1,000 child support allotment was $10,511. They had car loan \nand credit card payments of $1,610 and other living expenses of $5,586. This left a \nmonthly remainder of $4,924. He testified that he saved these remaining funds, which \nwould total almost $60,000 per year, \u201cto pay off all my education loans and my taxes, \nsave it for retirement too.\u201d He then estimated the current balance of his retirement account \nto be about $2,500. They had $9,500 in bank savings, investments, and personal assets. \n(AE W; Tr. 106-107.) \nApplicant also submitted a one-page copy of a page from an Equifax credit report \nstating that, \u201cas of June 13, 2022, . . . You currently have no Collections on your credit \nfile.\u201d That document has no identifying information concerning whose credit file it pertains \nto. However, since no objection was made to its authenticity, although it was merely \nidentified by Applicant\u2019s counsel as, \u201cCurrent Equifax statement reflecting no collection \naccounts,\u201d I presume it to have been a good-faith submission of a page from Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report.

He nevertheless acknowledged that he actually incurred the debts in \nquestion. (GE 7; AE U; Tr. 73-76, 103-104, 113-115.) \nApplicant was promoted to staff sergeant in August 2011. His NCO Evaluation \nReports from 2016 through 2018 stated that he \u201cmet standard.\u201d His senior rater comments \nin those evaluations included: \u201c\u2026has potential, with detailed instruction and supervision \nthe NCO can accomplish assigned tasks\u201d; \u201cSoldier has reached his maximum potential \nfor service and will RCP [meaning Retention Control Point, his maximum service time in \nrank] next year\u201d; and, \u201creached the limit of his potential for advancement and has an \napproved retirement date.\u201d Applicant was awarded three Army Commendation Medals, \nincluding one in July 2019, a Joint Service Achievement Medal, and two Army \nAchievement Medals, in addition to five Army Good Conduct Medals, and other unit and \nservice awards. (AE E; AE G.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe revocation of Applicant\u2019s former security clearance was pending in 2019, for \nfinancial concerns and related personal conduct issues, when he retired from active duty \nwith the acknowledgement that he would not retain national security eligibility. The 2021 \nSOR, which is the subject of this adjudication, alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent \ndebts, totaling $170,650 based on his September 16, 2019 credit report. He resolved his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent mortgage accounts by selling his house, took out a loan to refinance a car \nrepossession debt, and recently settled two long-delinquent; credit card debts for less \nthan he owed. After his hearing, he agreed with the collection agency to consolidate his \n$97,852.61 in delinquent student loan debt and make 360 monthly payments of $618.50. \nTwo other credit card accounts, a medical debt, another car loan, and a cell phone \naccount remain delinquent. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial issues: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies dates back to 2012, during his Army \nservice and before his 2015 divorce, and continue to date. He claims that his current \nfinancial situation is fully solvent, with almost $5,000 of monthly income in excess of his \nliving expenses, but he has not resolved or made regular payments toward his substantial \ndelinquent debts with those funds. He completed some online financial management \ncourses, but failed to demonstrate either a comprehensive understanding of his financial \nsituation or a good-faith track record of compliance with purported debt-resolution \nagreements. He did not establish clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. His remaining delinquent student loan, consumer, and \nFederal income tax debts cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of security concerns raised by his \nhistorical and continuing financial irresponsibility. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nhas not demonstrated accountability for resolving the numerous voluntarily incurred debts \nhe failed to repay as agreed. He served honorably in the Army and Navy, and has devoted \nmost of his adult life to support of national security objectives. However, Applicant failed \nto provide persuasive evidence of sufficient income security to ensure solvency in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished, as does \nthe likelihood of continuing financial issues. Overall, the evidence creates doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r and 1s:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1995. He was active duty and served as an electrician\u2019s mate until January 1999, when he received a general discharge under honorable conditions for a personality disorder. He maintained a DOD security clearance during his military service without any security incidents. He married in January 2002, and he has a son and daughter, ages 12 and 20. In April 2022, he and his wife separated while their divorce is pending. He has worked for a government contractor for over 20 years, and his duties include ensuring the security of the company\u2019s electronic medical records infrastructure and information technology (IT) systems.

Applicant, through counsel, provided a response to the SOR in \nMay 2021 and requested a hearing. He submitted documentation with his SOR response, \nas cited below. On June 8, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On December 16, 2022, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for February 15, 2023, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference \nsystem. His hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five Government exhibits (GE) 1\u00ad\n5; Applicant offered 56 documents labeled as Applicant exhibits (AE) A through DDD. All \nproffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. Three witnesses testified \non behalf of Applicant. I held the record open until March 1, 2023, in the event either party \nwanted to supplement the record with additional documentation. On February 23, 2023, I \nreceived a copy of the hearing transcript. (Tr.) On March 1, 2023, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nrequested an additional two-week extension, which I granted without objection. On March \n14, 2023, Applicant submitted 15 documents, (AE EEE through SSS); which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on March 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all 16 delinquent accounts totaling \n$130,670. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1995. He was active \nduty and served as an electrician\u2019s mate until January 1999, when he received a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions for a personality disorder. He maintained a DOD \nsecurity clearance during his military service without any security incidents. He married \nin January 2002, and he has a son and daughter, ages 12 and 20. In April 2022, he and \nhis wife separated while their divorce is pending. He has worked for a government \ncontractor for over 20 years, and his duties include ensuring the security of the company\u2019s \nelectronic medical records infrastructure and information technology (IT) systems. His \nannual salary for the past ten years has been greater than $135,000. He requires a \nposition of trust to perform his employment duties. (Tr. 25-30, 39, 87-89; GE 1; AE Q, AE \nR, AE S, AE T, AE U, AE BBB) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant experienced health issues beginning in 2011, and he lost 60 pounds \nwithin six months. He also suffered from intense headaches. After a medical screening \ndetected no signs of cancer, he was prescribed different medications that did not help his \ncondition. He saw a psychiatrist in about late 2011, and he was prescribed Abilify, a \npsychotropic medication used, in part, to treat symptoms of severe depression and \nanxiety. He testified at the hearing that he felt amazingly better on this medication, and \nhe quickly became a completely different person. For example, he has a fear of public \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspeaking, but while on this medication, he volunteered to give presentations on behalf of \nthe company, speaking in front of thousands of people. (Tr. 30-39) \nApplicant testified at the hearing that his financial problems can be attributed to the \nmedication\u2019s side-effect, which put him into a manic state. It also affected his memory \nfrom about late 2011 to at least April 2013. He stated that he felt like he was intoxicated \nduring this period. He had always been a frugal person, but while he was taking Abilify, \nhe started purchasing broken guns and computer equipment. He had great aspirations to \nstart a new business where he would fix these broken items and resell them for a profit \non his website. He also purchased several gifts for his wife and children without any \nconsideration of how he was going to pay for these purchases. (Tr. 39-44, 46-47; AE C, \nAE D, AE E) \nApplicant gave another example of a poor financial decision he made while under \nthe influence of Abilify. In about 2012, he went with his wife to a tattoo parlor, and he soon \nbecame friends with the employees. He noticed their computer system was antiquated, \nand he offered to update their computer system. He spent approximately $20,000 on their \nnew system, for which the owner of the tattoo parlor provided some small payments, but \nthe payments were not nearly enough to cover his expenses. The owner also gave him a \nfree tattoo. Applicant provided documented medical studies of the drug, Abilify, to support \nhis claim that this drug has put thousands of other users into a manic state, which is one \nof its side-effects. (Tr. 44-47) \nIn April 2013, while Applicant was off work and recovering from surgery, he \nrealized for the first time that he was in serious financial trouble. He panicked, stopped \ntaking his prescribed medications, and he tried to develop a plan to pay his maxed-out \ncredit cards. He met with a bankruptcy attorney, but he eventually decided against filing \nfor bankruptcy. He decided he would pay back his creditors on his own, and his top priority \nwas to pay his tax debt with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He always filed his \nincome tax returns timely, but he was unable to pay his $18,142 in taxes due for tax year \n(TY) 2012, and $13,264 in taxes for TY 2013. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.o.) He made several \npayments to the IRS, and in late 2020, he took out a 401(K) loan and used the proceeds \nto pay the remainder of the tax debts. He provided copies of his tax transcripts. The \noutstanding tax debts for TYs 2012 and 2013 are fully resolved. (Tr. 54-66, 82-84, 96-97, \n111; AE O, AE P, AE WW) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.p. allege Applicant is indebted to his state tax department in the \namount of $3,296 for TY 2012, and $2,396 for TY 2013. He made several payments to \nthe state tax authority, and then he took out a 401(K) loan in late 2020 and used the \nproceeds to pay the remainder of the tax debts. The outstanding tax debts for TYs 2012 \nand 2013 are fully resolved. (Tr. 82-84; AE XX) \nApplicant received a FORM 1099-C from a credit card bank creditor for tax year \n2022. The SOR alleged he was indebted to this creditor in the amount of $39,285. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. Note: SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a duplicate allegation.) The 1099-C is a cancellation of the debt, \nand he is required to report the creditor\u2019s loss of $45,275 as income when he files his \n2022 Federal and state income tax returns.

Since this account was disputed, an internal process was initiated and the \naccount was locked until March 27, 2023, so the dispute could be processed.

He provided \ndocumentation verifying that he paid approximately $45,000 from 2014 through 2018, to \nseven creditors. Most of these payments came from wage garnishments. Applicant \ntestified that he did not protest any garnishments because he owed the creditor the money \nand it was easier to have the money taken directly from his pay than set up payments. \nOut of the 16 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling $130,670, all but three \naccounts have been resolved, or are currently being resolved.

(AE HH, AE II, \nAE JJ, AE KK, AE LL, AE MM, AE NN, AE OO, AE PP) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [public trust position].\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access to classified information \napplies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in \nChief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity or other sensitive information and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See Id. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in \nthe Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her [access to sensitive information].\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation \nomitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust position].  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes potentially disqualifying conditions that could raise a \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case, as follows: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe credit reports in the record and Applicant\u2019s admissions support his history of \nindebtedness and his failure to pay state and Federal taxes when due. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nBeginning in late 2011, Applicant\u2019s experienced mania, one of the medical side-\neffects from taking a prescribed medication, Abilify. He was unable to fully comprehend \nthe consequences of his spending spree, which was a circumstance beyond his control. \nAt the time he was taking this medication, he was under the care of a doctor and followed \nthe doctor\u2019s treatment plan. This new behavior was completely out of character for him, \nas Applicant had been known to be frugal. \nIn April 2013, when Applicant realized the depth of his financial quandary, he \nbegan repaying his creditors, which took a long time due to the large amount of \naccumulated debt. It is important to note that some of his delinquent creditors were not \nlisted on his SOR because he had, or was in the process, of paying these accounts, albeit, \nusually from a wage garnishment. This course of action was viewed by him as a \nresponsible way to repay his creditors. He has made significant progress in managing his \nfinances. He has also paid his state and Federal back taxes from TYs 2012 and 2013. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d) and 20(g) apply. Overall, I find his efforts are sufficient to \nmitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 47 years old, and he has worked for a government contractor for over \n20 years. His employment duties include ensuring the security of the company\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nelectronic medical records infrastructure and IT systems.

However, she did not state that any \nof this treatment was alcohol related. Further, under Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, she \ndenied that she ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment due to her alcohol use. \n(GX 1) \nDuring her interview with a security clearance background investigator in \nFebruary 2018, Applicant described her earlier psychological counseling but \u201cfailed to \nnote that this counseling was due to [her] voluntary alcohol treatment.\u201d Applicant \nindicated she was \u201cashamed to list her treatment for alcohol use.\u201d She then described \nher period of \u201cbinge drinking\u201d from about 2014 through 2016.

She described being in an abusive relationship in \n2014 through 2015 and said she had only gone to therapy because of her ex-boyfriend. \nShe stated she had previously been diagnosed with acute bipolar disorder and had \nbeen prescribed Lexapro and naltrexone but \u201crarely took them and did not take them \nseriously.\u201d She reported she was typically drinking one alcoholic beverage a day. \nApplicant was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, major depressive \ndisorder and an unspecified anxiety disorder. Diagnoses of alcohol abuse disorder and \nbipolar disorder were ruled out and she was prescribed Prozac. (AX E) \nIn September 2019, Applicant returned to Ms. K.R. with complaints of high \nanxiety related to her work and personal issues. There was no indication of alcohol-\nrelated issues or treatment from these records. Applicant was again prescribed Prozac \nand a course of mental health treatment was established. She remained compliant with \nher provider\u2019s recommendations and, over the next two years, her anxiety and \ndepression decreased.

Applicant claimed that she continued to consume alcohol at \na level that her psychiatrist and therapist believed did not meet the criteria for alcohol \nuse disorder. (GX 4) \nIn December 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation with Dr. C.B., \nPh.D., at the request of DOD. During that evaluation, Applicant stated that she began \ndrinking excessively in 2015 as a poor mechanism for relationship struggles and that \nher drinking was no longer excessive after she separated from her boyfriend in 2017. \n(GX 5-6) \nWith regard to her alcohol consumption at the time of the evaluation, Applicant \ninformed Dr. C.B. that she consumed one or two glasses of wine, primarily on the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nweekends.

She further claimed she was unaware she had been diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependency \u201cuntil well after the fact\u201d and the \nmedication she had been prescribed in 2015 was to curb her shopping impulses. \nApplicant stated that she consumed alcohol responsibly and would continue to discuss \nher drinking habits with her therapist and modify her consumption if needed. Applicant \nalso denied providing false information during her alcohol use evaluation in August \n2021. \nIn May 2023, Applicant was seen by Ms. J.M.R. (LCSW), a new counselor within \nher current medical practice group. Ms. J.M.R. summarized that Applicant suffered from \ngeneralized anxiety disorder that was being managed by coping skills and medication. \nMs. J.M.R. opined that neither Applicant\u2019s condition nor consumption of alcohol had any \nimpact on her judgment, stability, reliability or trustworthiness. (AX J) \nAt her DOHA hearing, Applicant described seeing Dr. J.R. in 2015 for therapy, \nbut denied being seen for alcohol-use problems. She further denied ever being treated \nfor an alcohol use disorder. Applicant again claimed that the medication Dr. J.R. \nprescribed was to curb her shopping impulses and was unrelated to her use of alcohol. \nShe further claimed she did not know that Dr. J.R. had diagnosed her with an alcohol \nuse disorder until she received the initial SOR. (Tr. 16-18, 28-33, 54-56) \nWhen Applicant was confronted with her January 2020 interrogatory response \nthat reflected her awareness of her alcohol-dependency diagnosis and treatment, she \nclaimed not to recall filling out the questionnaire. Applicant also could not recall telling \nDr. C.B. about her history of seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Instead, she stated \u201cI \nbelieve it is not who I am anymore, so I understand that the records say it, but it is not \nreally that prevalent in my memory right now.\u201d (Tr. 29-32, 39-40) \nApplicant described working with several counselors since first seeking treatment \nwith her current medical group in 2019.

She said she now maintains strong work and \npersonal relationships and stated that she does not have an alcohol-use problem. \n(Tr. 32, 72-74) \nApplicant submitted multiple character letters from individuals, some of whom \nhave worked with her since at least 2013. They all describe her as an exemplary \nemployee who consistently exceeded expectations. They further note that she has held \na security clearance with access to classified materials without incident and maintains a \nhigh degree of professionalism, integrity, and dedication. A recent performance \nappraisal stated that Applicant had either met or exceeded all expectations. (AX G-I) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for alcohol consumption under \nAG \u00b6 22 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nIn about 2014, Applicant experienced high levels of stress and anxiety from an \nemotionally abusive relationship with her boyfriend. She described that she was \u201cbinge\u201d \ndrinking during this time. In 2015, she sought out mental health treatment and was \ndiagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and alcohol \ndependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMedical records from her treatment during this period reflect that Applicant was \nprescribed naltrexone in order to curb her alcohol cravings. She took the medication for \nseveral months to her benefit. However, she terminated her treatment in December \n2015 against the recommendations of her counselor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), (d) and (e) are \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nHowever, even with Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence in 2015, the \nrecord is absent a clear directive that she abstain from alcohol consumption. Instead, \nthe record reflects that she was compliant with her treatment, her mental health \nimproved and she exhibited better control over her alcohol consumption over time. \nWhen Applicant resumed her mental health treatment in 2019, her treatment plan \nfocused on her major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. Her counselors \nruled out a diagnosis of alcohol abuse disorder. Since then, she has not treated for any \nissues related to alcohol and has not been directed to modify her alcohol consumption, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 22(f) is not applicable and SOR \u00b6 1.b has not been \nestablished. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \nI did not find Applicant to be forthright at hearing regarding her history of alcohol \ntreatment. (See discussion below) However, medical records and statements made \nduring her background interview reflect that she experienced noted improvement in her \noverall mental health during her treatment in 2015. She did not return to binge \nconsumption of alcohol when she stopped treating in December 2015. Her mental \nhealth further improved when she separated from her boyfriend in 2017. \nIn 2019, when she thought about dating again, Applicant voluntarily sought out \nadditional counseling to address her anxiety concerns. Since then, she has maintained \nconsistent mental-health treatment and her counselors have provided favorable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassessments of her mental-health conditions. They are also aware of her alcohol \nconsumption but are notably not treating her for a substance abuse disorder and \nspecifically ruled out an alcohol abuse disorder. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s ongoing mental-health treatment and medical records, a \nlack of negative law enforcement or work issues related to alcohol, as well as positive \nstatements from her work colleagues all reflect that Applicant has overcome her alcohol \nproblem and demonstrated that she is able to consume alcohol responsibly. She has \nexperienced changed circumstances since 2015 when she used alcohol as a coping \nmechanism. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(c) are applicable. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s successful treatment for alcohol dependency in 2015 and her \npositive mental-health treatment over the years, her inconsistent statements about her \nhistory of alcohol treatment and her refusal to acknowledge that treatment at hearing \nmakes mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b) inapplicable as she failed to fully and consistently \nacknowledge her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use. However, her reluctance in \ndiscussing her past difficulties with alcohol does not directly equate to her currently \nhaving problems with alcohol consumption. As previously noted, Applicant has \ndemonstrated that she is able to consume alcohol responsibly. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant made deliberately \nfalse statements in her 2016 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.a), in her Answer to the first SOR, in August \n2021 (Answer # 1) (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and in her August 2021 alcohol evaluation (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nAll of the false statements alleged concern her history of alcohol treatment and \ndiagnoses. SOR \u00b6 2.d is a cross-allegation of the Guideline G allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. \nBeginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application and continuing \nthrough the investigative phase, \u201cthe security clearance investigation is not a forum for \nan applicant to split hairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information.\u201d That \ncompelling interest includes the legitimate interest in being able to make sound \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecisions based on complete and accurate information.

ISCR Case No. 01-03132 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) The Government must \nproduce substantial evidence that an omission was deliberate and not merely that the \nomission occurred. ISCR Case No. 07-16511 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 16 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nIn 2015, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment for various mental health \nconcerns and alcohol dependency. She disclosed her mental health treatment in her \nJuly 2016 SCA, but did not disclose her voluntary treatment for alcohol as required. \nDuring her February 2018 background interview, she stated that she was ashamed to \nlist her alcohol treatment in her SCA. This was a deliberate omission and AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nAdditionally, during her alcohol-use evaluation in August 2021, Applicant told \nMs. K.B. that she never sought services associated with alcohol while treating with \nDr. J.R. and was \u201cadamant\u201d that neither Dr. J.R. nor any therapist in that office ever told \nher that she had a drinking problem or needed treatment for alcohol. However, prior to \nthis evaluation, Applicant confirmed her awareness of her own alcohol diagnosis and \ntreatment in her January 2020 interrogatory responses. Then, during her psychological \nevaluation in December 2021 with Dr. C.B., she described drinking excessively in 2015 \nand receiving alcohol treatment.

AG \u00b6 16(b) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nIn her August 2021 SOR Answer (Answer #1) to the Guideline G allegations, \nApplicant stated that she consumed alcohol at a level that her psychiatrist and therapist \nbelieved did not meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder. In SOR \u00b6 2.b, the second \nSOR alleges that she deliberately falsified this statement because her psychiatrist at the \ntime issued no such opinion. \nApplicant\u2019s statement is supported by her treatment history. Beginning in 2019, \nher medical records reflect that she was treated for mental health issues, not an alcohol \nuse disorder, even though her counselors were aware of her alcohol consumption. Later \nrecords make clear that she was never treated for a substance abuse disorder in 2019 \nor afterwards. This is consistent with Applicant\u2019s understanding of her treatment during \nthat time. The falsification allegation within SOR \u00b6 2.b has not been established and \nneither AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) nor 16(b) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d is a cross-allegation of all of the alcohol consumption allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol use is discussed under Guideline G above. However, her \ndecision to terminate her treatment in 2015 against the advice of her therapist raises \nsufficient whole-person concerns for AG \u00b6 16(c) to be applicable. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes the following conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant omitted her alcohol treatment history in her July 2016 SCA. She denied \nany history of alcohol treatment during her August 2021 evaluation with Ms. K.B. She \nfurther denied any history of alcohol treatment in her May 2022 SOR Answer. At \nhearing, she claimed not to recall her history of alcohol treatment because she believed \nit was not who she was anymore and that it was not \u201cprevalent\u201d in her memory. \nDespite the progress that Applicant made in her mental-health treatment and in \nresolving her alcohol consumption concerns, she failed to make prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the record by providing an accurate history of her alcohol treatment \nduring the security investigation process. She did not meet her burden of mitigating the \npreviously established falsification allegations. This involved a significant matter of her \npast and continues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) nor 17(c) is applicable to either SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a or 2.c. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s decision to terminate her treatment in 2015 did not result in \nher returning to binge drinking or experiencing any other alcohol related incidents. She \nhas since benefited from ongoing mental health treatment and resolved her alcohol use \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to the cross-allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant sought out treatment for mental health concerns and alcohol abuse in \n2014 and 2015. Although she terminated her treatment at the end of 2015, her \ncircumstances continued to improve, particularly after she separated from her boyfriend \nin 2017. In 2019, when she decided to start dating again, she sought out additional \ncounseling. She has continued in treatment for conditions unrelated to alcohol. Her \ncounselors are aware of her alcohol consumption and are unconcerned. Applicant has \novercome security concerns about her alcohol diagnoses and consumption under \nGuideline G. \nHowever, despite this progress, Applicant failed to disclose her history of alcohol \ntreatment in her SCA because she was ashamed by it. She further attempted to conceal \nher treatment history during an alcohol use evaluation. Her significant progress in her \nmental-health treatment and in overcoming the security concerns about her alcohol \nconsumption do not overcome her refusal to provide a complete history of her treatment \nin her SCA or during the security investigation process. This involved a relevant and \nmaterial component of her past. As I did not find Applicant to be forthright at hearing, I \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, tax records, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent under \nsuch circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His failure to pay his delinquent debt and \nfile his past-due income tax returns is both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and \nunresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that his debts or unfiled tax \nreturns occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant has at least six years of unfiled Federal and \nstate income tax returns. He has known about his tax issues for several years, and he \nhas not made any documented effort to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts and unfiled Federal and state income tax returns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for eligibility for access to \nclassified information in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Applicant has offered nothing to refute this allegation. \nAdministrative Notice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the Republic of the \nPhilippines (the Philippines): the Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a \nbicameral legislature. In 2019, the Philippines made the lists of the top ten countries \nwith the most terrorist incidents and the most terrorists casualties. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, there have been numerous criminal cases concerning export \nenforcement related to the Philippines. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a foreign national. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant cohabitates with a foreign national, without further explanation. Foreign \nInfluence is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \nThis concern is not applicable. Applicant was the victim of an assault by a foreign \nnational. He was removed from Saudi Arabia through no fault of his own. Personal \nConduct is found for Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nApplicant has failed to file Federal income tax returns for seven years, \n2011~2017. He also has a significant outstanding judgment.These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has failed to address the Government\u2019s financial \nsecurity concerns. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guidelines for Foreign Influence, and Financial \nConsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a~3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. National security eligibility is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Additional findings of fact follow. \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 45-year-old subject matter expert level 4 employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2018. He seeks to retain his secret security clearance, which \nis a requirement of his continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 11-13) \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1994. He was awarded an \nassociate of arts degree in general studies in February 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 13-15) \nApplicant was married from 2005 to 2018, and that marriage ended by divorce. He does \nnot have any children. (GE 1; Tr. 15-16) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from January 1996 to January 2000, \nand was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). He reentered the Marine \nCorps in May 2001 and served continuously until he retired as a staff sergeant (pay \ngrade E-6) in August 2017. His military occupational specialty at the time of his \nretirement was 0848 (field artillery operations chief). (GE 1; AE E; Tr. 16-17) Applicant \nhas been awarded a Veterans Affairs (VA) 100% total and permanent disability rating in \npart for combat-related injuries. (Tr. 17-18; AE J) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility for the 10 delinquent SOR debts, totaling approximately \n$73,828, is established by his SOR Answer; his May 2018, September 2019, and July \n2021 credit reports; his February 21, 2019 Office of Personnel Management Personal \nSubject Interview (OPM PSI); and his hearing testimony. (SOR Answer; Tr. 19-43; GE 2 \n\u2013 5) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originated when he was married to his former \nspouse. He described his marriage as contentious, especially around the time he and \nhis wife separated in 2016. (Tr. 20, 38) Applicant\u2019s last assignment in the Marine Corps \nrequired him to move from the East Coast to the West Coast, however, his wife initially \nchose not to accompany him. She was not employed and they fell into debt trying to \nmaintain two households. (Tr. 19-21, 23) Applicant contacted a bankruptcy attorney in \n2016 before he retired from the Marine Corps, but could not afford the filing fee.

(Tr. 22-24) \nI advised Applicant that ignoring his legally incurred debts by letting them fall off \nhis credit report was not an acceptable means of debt resolution in the security \nclearance venue. (Tr. 24-25) Post-hearing, Applicant provided documentation that he \nhad paid or resolved five of his ten SOR debts, and that he enrolled the remaining five \ndebts in a debt consolidation program (DCP), on October 6, 2021, discussed below. (AE \nC) \nThe following is a summary of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts and their status: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - $21,671 charged-off consolidation loan.

This debt is enrolled in Applicant\u2019s \nDCP, and is being repaid. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (Tr. 37-38; AE C, AE D(1)). \nAs the above summary reflects, Applicant has paid or resolved five of his ten \nSOR debts, and enrolled the other five debts in a DCP. As part of his DCP, Applicant \nparticipated in financial counseling. The DCP that Applicant submitted is measured and \nthorough. Beginning on October 15, 2021, Applicant began paying $866 each month to \nthe DCP by direct debit. Applicant will continue to pay that amount until the enrolled \ndebts are satisfied or otherwise resolved. The DCP also prepared a monthly budget for \nApplicant that reflects that his total monthly income is $8,300, which includes $5,200 \ntake home pay and $3,100 in VA disability benefits. After all deductions, he has a net \nmonthly remainder of $240. (AE C) \nApplicant rents a single family home on a military base for $2,539 per month. \nThat fee includes all utilities except for cable. His budget further reflects that he \nmaintains a modest lifestyle and lives within his means. Applicant is current on all his \nother debts. (Tr. 39-40; AE C) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted several documents to include his DD 214s, summaries of \naction and citations for his personal awards from his Marine Corps service, evaluations \ndocumenting his performance as a Marine from 2008 to 2016, civilian performance \nreviews documenting his performance as a Government contractor from 2018 to 2020, \nand six reference letters from former commanders and supervisors. The collective \nmessage these documents convey is that Applicant has honorably served his country \nfor 20 years and five months as an active duty Marine, and continued his service as a \nGovernment contractor for the past four years. All of the individuals who submitted \nreference letters recommend and support continuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence of record establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nFurther review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant underwent a \ncontentious and costly divorce towards the end of his Marine Corps career. The \nfinancial fallout from that divorce continues to this day. Applicant has paid or resolved \nfive of his ten SOR debts, and enrolled the other five debts in a DCP. As part of his \nDCP, Applicant participated in financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s DCP is measured and \nthorough. Beginning on October 15, 2021, Applicant began paying $866 each month to \nthe DCP by direct debit. Applicant will continue to pay that amount until the enrolled \ndebts are satisfied or otherwise resolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nApplicant would have begun the process of addressing his delinquent debts \nsooner had he not received legal advice to wait until his debts fell off his credit report. \nOnce Applicant was informed that this approach was not an acceptable means of debt \nresolution in the security clearance arena, he immediately took action to right his ship. \nFive of his debts are paid or resolved and the remaining five debts are enrolled in a \nDCP. Applicant has made significant or sufficient progress towards regaining financial \nresponsibility in a deliberate and measured way. With this in mind, the adjudicative \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidelines do not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Appeal Board has \nestablished the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view \nApplicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Given his resources, he \nhas initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of the five remaining SOR debts \nand is making a good-faith effort to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s 20 years as an active duty Marine and four \nyears as defense contractor while successfully holding a clearance weigh in his favor. \nHe is current on his day-to-day expenses, lives within his means, and his SOR debts \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave been resolved or are being resolved.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 47, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor since June 2021. He has worked as a Federal contractor since 2000. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998 and his master\u2019s degree in 2000. He married in 2000 and divorced in 2012. He has two children, ages 16 and 8. Applicant married again in 2020. He has held a security clearance since 2000. (GX 2; GX 3; Response.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant was indebted for a Federal tax lien entered in 2012 in the approximate amount of $37,123; that he is indebted to his state 2 of residence for tax lien entered in 2016 in the approximate amount of $628; that he was past due on a vehicle-loan account in the amount of $656 with the total debt of $35,372; that he is indebted on the charged-off mortgage-loan account in the approximate amount of $27,458; and that he is indebted for a judgment entered against him in 2020 in the amount of $2,703. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the first three SOR allegations with an explanation for how he incurred the debts and their current statuses. He denied that the mortgage-loan debt remained delinquent. (GX 2; GX 3; Answer.) At the hearing, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e, but stated that he paid the judgment of $2,073 in full.

On May 13, 2022, I emailed Department Counsel and \nApplicant informing them of the inaccuracies and giving Department Counsel until May \n20, 2022, to amend the FORM and Applicant until May 27, 2022, to respond to any \namendment. Department Counsel submitted an amended FORM on May 20, 2022. On \nMay 24, 2022, Applicant requested additional time to respond to the amended Form, \nwhich I granted until June 3, 2022. On May 31, 2022, Applicant requested to convert the \nFORM to a hearing and I granted that request. On June 8, 2022, Applicant\u2019s attorney \nentered his appearance. On that same day, based on the availability of both parties, I \nscheduled a hearing for August 16, 2022 using Microsoft Teams. I have appended the \nemails to the record as Admin. Ex. II. The DOHA hearing office issued the Notice of \nHearing on July 1, 2022. \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Prior to the hearing, Department Counsel \nsubmitted two additional documents, GX 9 and 10. GX 1 through 10 were admitted at the \nhearing without objection. Also prior to the hearing, Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through S. AX A through D are copies of the original SOR; Applicant\u2019s \nanswer; the FORM; and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. As these are part of the \nrecord, I did not admit them as exhibits. AX E through S were admitted at the hearing \nwithout objection. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows: amend \nSOR \u00b6 1.a to: \u201cYou were indebted to the federal government for a tax lien entered against \nyou in 2012, in the approximate amount of $37,123 that remained unpaid until July, 2018;\u201d \nand, add SOR \u00b6 1.e, \u201cYou are indebted to Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC, for a \njudgement entered against you in August, 2020 in the approximate amount of $2,703. As \nof the date of this Statement of Reasons, the judgement remains unpaid.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel did not object, and I amended the SOR as requested by Department Counsel. \nDOHA received the transcript on August 23, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 47, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor \nsince June 2021. He has worked as a Federal contractor since 2000. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1998 and his master\u2019s degree in 2000. He married in 2000 and \ndivorced in 2012. He has two children, ages 16 and 8. Applicant married again in 2020. \nHe has held a security clearance since 2000. (GX 2; GX 3; Response.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant was indebted for a Federal tax \nlien entered in 2012 in the approximate amount of $37,123; that he is indebted to his state \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof residence for tax lien entered in 2016 in the approximate amount of $628; that he was \npast due on a vehicle-loan account in the amount of $656 with the total debt of $35,372; \nthat he is indebted on the charged-off mortgage-loan account in the approximate amount \nof $27,458; and that he is indebted for a judgment entered against him in 2020 in the \namount of $2,703. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the first three SOR \nallegations with an explanation for how he incurred the debts and their current statuses. \nHe denied that the mortgage-loan debt remained delinquent. (GX 2; GX 3; Answer.) At \nthe hearing, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e, but stated that he paid the judgment of $2,073 \nin full. (Tr. 78-81.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhile living in another state between 2001 and 2005, Applicant hired a \nprofessional tax preparer to file his income tax returns. He received refunds for each of \nthose tax years. In 2005, he moved to his current state of residence. In 2007 or 2008, \nApplicant received a letter from the IRS that stated that he was being audited for tax years \n2001 through 2005 and that the information provided on his tax returns would likely be \nadjusted. As a result of the audit, the IRS informed Applicant that he owed taxes for 2001 \nto 2005, as well as repayment of the erroneous refunds. (Tr. 41-42; Tr. 106-124.) \nAfter selling his house in another state in 2005, Applicant paid off all his existing \nconsumer debt. However, his wife spent excessively and again maximized their credit-\ncard debt and incurred other consumer debt. At the time that Applicant received notice \nfrom the IRS about his tax liability due to the results of the audit, Applicant did not have \nthe funds to pay the taxes owed. Additionally, for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010, \nApplicant was inadvertently not having enough taxes withheld from his paychecks. He \nwas also earning income from his rental properties, which created greater tax liabilities. \nHe adjusted his withholding rate beginning in tax year 2011. (Tr. 56-57; Tr. 115-124.) \nApplicant was laid off from his job in February 2010 and was unemployed until April \n2010. He withdrew money from his 401(k) to cover his and his family\u2019s living expenses, \nto include his mortgage loan payments and credit card and other consumer debt \npayments. At the time of the withdrawal, Applicant did not understand the rate at which \nhe would be taxed, and opted to defer paying taxes in favor of having access to a larger \nsum of money. He was unable to fully meet his tax obligation owed from the withdrawal. \n(Tr. 45-47; Tr. 67-70.) \nThe IRS secured a tax lien against Applicant and his wife in November 2012 in the \namount of $37,123. The tax debt was comprised of the 2001 through 2005 tax debts, the \ntaxes owed for the 401(k) withdrawal, the taxes incurred due to improper withholding, and \nthe taxes incurred from the income from the rental properties. Applicant and his wife\u2019s \ndivorce was finalized in September 2012. As part of their divorce decree, they entered a \nsettlement agreement that contained a provision under which they agreed that Applicant \nwould pay $922 a month and his wife would pay $550 month towards their joint tax debt \nuntil the debt was satisfied.

In addition to remaining responsible for half of the costs of \nmaintaining the marital residence and paying the credit card and other consumer debt, \nhe was also paying rent for his residence and associated expenses. He also became \nresponsible for monthly child support that was backdated to September 2012. As a result \nof this increased financial strain, his payments to the IRS were sporadic. (Tr. 43.) \nIn late 2012 or early 2013, Applicant realized that his wife was not making any tax \npayments on their joint tax obligation. He went to the local IRS branch with the intention \nof setting up a repayment plan. He also asked if his name could be removed from the tax \ndebt once he paid his required share of his joint tax debt. He was informed that as long \nas his name was on the debt, he was responsible for it. He agreed to a repayment \narrangement that would automatically take $500 a month from his Federal civilian \nemployee pay by allotment. (Tr. 57-68.) \nWhen Applicant left federal employment in 2016, the automatic $500 a month \nallotments stopped. He continued to make payments on the tax debt and the IRS \ncontinued to withhold his refunds. In March 2018, Applicant entered an installment \nagreement with the IRS under which he paid $500 a month. Applicant\u2019s former wife did \nnot make payments on their joint tax debt as agreed. Applicant stated, \u201cI have paid more \nthan the agreed-upon amount in my divorce decree, but have done so because I \nunderstand the significance of resolving taxes owed.\u201d (Tr. 68; AX E; AX F; Answer.) \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP in November 2016, he estimated his total \ndebt to be approximately $43,000. However, through his payments and the withholding \nby the IRS of the refunds that Applicant was due to receive, he paid the tax debt in full. \nThe 2012 tax lien was released in July 2018, and Applicant satisfied the installment \nagreement in May 2021. Applicant has a $0 balance owed for his delinquent taxes. (GX \n3; Tr. 106-124; AX E; AX F.) Applicant owes approximately $6,000 for his 2021 Federal \ntaxes and is making automatic payments of $600 per month beginning in September \n2022. (Tr. 72.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. \nIn 2005, Applicant bought three rental duplexes located on the same street in his \nthen wife\u2019s hometown in another state. He purchased the properties as an investment \nthat he intended to ultimately use to fund his children\u2019s college educations. Two of the \nproperties were financed through 80/20 mortgage loans, where one lender provided 80% \nof the loan and a second lender provided 20% of the loan. The third property was financed \nthrough a single lender. (Tr. 56-57; Tr. 82-83.) \nThe neighborhood where the properties were located was comprised of primarily \nrental units and Applicant frequently received offers to purchase the rental properties from \nhim. Around the time of Applicant\u2019s 2012 divorce, he decided to sell the properties for \nfinancial and personal reasons, which included increased difficulty in renting to reliable \ntenants who regularly paid their rent. He also found it difficult to manage the properties \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile living in another state. Finally, he did not want to incur tax liabilities that he could \nnot afford to pay. He contacted one of the people who had routinely offered to purchase \nthe properties, and they negotiated a verbal agreement. However, the agreed-upon sales \nprices were less than what Applicant owed on the existing mortgage loans. (Tr. 61-62; Tr. \n115-121; Tr. 81-96.) \nApplicant then contacted a real estate agent who acted as the liaison between \nApplicant and the lending banks. Applicant submitted paperwork to each of the lenders \nfor their agreement and approval of short sales of the properties. The lender that held the \n100% the loan on the one property agreed to the short sale and forgave the deficiency \nbalance owed on the loan. (Tr. 81-96.) \nHowever, the negotiations with the 80% lender for the two properties with 80/20 \nloans were extensive. Before Applicant was able to reach an agreement with the 80% \nlender, the lender began foreclosure proceedings. The two properties were foreclosed. \nThe 80% lender on both properties forgave the deficiency balances, if they existed. The \n20% lender forgave the deficiency balance on one of the properties, but not the other. \nThis is the $27,458 charged-off mortgage-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 81-96.) \nAt the time of the sales of these properties, Applicant erroneously thought that in \na short sale or a foreclosure, the lender necessarily assumed the loss for any deficiency \nbalance. Following the foreclosures and short sale, Applicant was never contacted by \neither the former or the current creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 86-91.) \nAt some point between 2014 and 2016, while working with a real estate agent in \nanticipation of possibly purchasing a primary residence, Applicant pulled his credit report. \nUpon seeing the charged-off mortgage-loan debt on Applicant\u2019s credit report, the real \nestate agent suggested that Applicant contact the mortgage lender listed as the creditor \nand try to resolve the debt. Applicant contacted the creditor and was informed that there \nwas no record of the loan. The creditor was unable to locate any loan associated with any \nof the rental properties or Applicant\u2019s name. Because the three other mortgage-loan \nbalances on the loans on the two foreclosed properties had been forgiven and were listed \nas \u201csettled\u201d on his credit report, Applicant thought that the delinquent mortgage-loan \naccount listed on his credit report was a reporting error. (Tr. 90-92; Tr. 98.) \nIn 2018, Applicant again noted that the delinquent mortgage-loan was still listed \non a recent credit bureau report, however with a different creditor, also a mortgage lender. \nApplicant contacted the current creditor that could not find a loan associated with the \nproperty or Applicant\u2019s name. He gave the creditor the account number from the original \nloan, and the creditor was still unable to locate any loan account associated with \nApplicant. After receiving the SOR in May 2021, Applicant made the same outreach to \nthe creditor with the same result. He contacted the creditor most recently in June or July \n2022, again with the same result. Applicant is willing and has the resources to resolve \nthis debt. The debt does not appear on Applicant\u2019s September 2019 credit bureau report. \nHe has always timely filed his Federal and state tax returns.

This debt arose because Applicant was \nunknowingly under withholding his state taxes from his pay in 2013. This debt was paid \nwith Applicant\u2019s 2014 state tax refund, and the lien was released in July 2016. (AX T; Tr. \n125-127.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 $656 past-due on a vehicle loan with a balance of $35,372, current. \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant was past due on his vehicle payment. He is \ncurrent on the payments and in May 2021, began making the payments through an \nautomatic debit from his checking account. (AX H; Tr. 127-131.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 $2,703 judgment, paid. This debt was owed to an e-commerce \ncompany from which Applicant had made multiple purchases over many years. However, \nwhen he learned that he had incurred this debt, he did not recognize the amount and was \nunable to correlate it with a specific purchase. He disputed the debt and, after not \nreceiving any correspondence from the creditor, thought the dispute had been successful. \nIn 2021, he was notified that the debt had gone to collections and a judgment had been \nentered in August 2020 in favor of the collection agency. In January 2022, Applicant \ncontacted the collection agency, made an initial payment over the telephone, and verbally \nentered a repayment agreement. In March 2022, he noticed that the payments were not \nbeing debited from his account, and again contacted the collection agency. In June 2022, \nhe made a lump-sum payment to satisfy the debt. (AX U; AX S; Tr. 79-81; Tr. 136-138.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from 2011 through 2015, 2021, and mid-year \n2022 are outstanding and collectively state that Applicant is a reliable, strong leader, who \nis trustworthy and exercises good judgment. (AX N.) Throughout his career, Applicant \nhas received multiple awards, letters of recognition, and certifications. (AX P.) \nApplicant called three character witnesses and submitted six letters of \nrecommendation. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor since June 2020 stated that Applicant is \nloyal and dedicated and strongly recommends him for a security clearance. (Tr. 29-35; \nAX R.) Two of Applicant\u2019s current coworkers collectively stated that Applicant is a person \nof integrity who is professional and trustworthy, with a strong work ethic. (AX R.) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor met Applicant in 2008 when they were working as peers on \nthe classified project. In 2018, she hired him to work on a project for her.

(AX K; AX L; AX M; AX Q.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues arose under circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur and were due to conditions that were largely beyond his control. From 2001 through \n2005, Applicant filed his taxes through a professional tax preparer, and received refunds \nfor each of the tax years. In 2005, Applicant sold his house and moved to his current state \nof residence. Due to the strong seller\u2019s market, he was able to pay all of his credit card \nand other consumer debt with the proceeds. Applicant\u2019s wife was an excessive spender \nand within a short period of time, amassed extensive credit card and other consumer \ndebt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2007 or 2008, Applicant received notice from the IRS that his 2001 through 2005 \ntax returns were being audited. He subsequently received notice that he owed taxes for \neach of the tax years as well as reimbursement to the IRS of the refunds that he had \nreceived. Due to improper withholding of taxes from his paychecks and taxable income \nfrom his rental properties, Applicant also owed taxes for 2008 through 2010. Additionally, \nwhile laid off for approximately three months in 2010, Applicant borrowed money from his \n401(k) and incurred tax liability on the withdrawal.

As a result of these different unpaid taxes, the IRS entered a lien \nagainst Applicant and his wife in 2012. \nApplicant and his wife divorced in September 2012. Applicant moved out of the \nmarital residence in January 2013 and his monthly expenses increased significantly, \nincluding child support payments which were backdated to September 2012, which \ncreated even greater overall financial strain. \nHowever, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances in several ways. \nFirst, he ensured that his tax withholdings were properly adjusted in 2011. Second, in \n2012, as part of their divorce settlement, Applicant and his wife agreed to each pay a \nportion of their joint tax debt. In late 2012 or early 2013, upon learning that his ex-wife \nwas not making any payments to the IRS, Applicant went to the local IRS office and \nvoluntarily entered a monthly repayment plan through an allotment from his paychecks. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife did not comply with the terms of their tax repayment agreement. After \nhis Federal employment ended in 2016, Applicant made voluntarily payments to the IRS. \nIn March 2018, Applicant entered a formal installment plan under which he paid the IRS \n$500 a month. The 2012 lien was released in July 2018 and the installment plan was \nsatisfied in May 2021. Applicant fully repaid all of his delinquent taxes. He has always \ntimely filed his tax returns. \nIn 2012, Applicant initiated action to sell the three rental properties by contacting \na known interested buyer. They entered into an agreement, and Applicant hired a real \nestate agent to negotiate the sales between the mortgage holders and the buyer. The \nsales stalled through no fault of Applicant, and he ended up selling one of the properties \nthrough a short sale and the other two properties were foreclosed. It was Applicant\u2019s \nunderstanding that each of the mortgage holders agreed to forgive any existing deficiency \nbalances. Applicant never received any type of notice of the $27,458 charged-off \nmortgage-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. When he first learned of the debt after reviewing \na credit bureau report, he believed the listing of the debt was a clerical error because the \nsame mortgage lender had forgiven the deficiency balance on his other loan. \nIn 2018, after noting the mortgage-loan debt was still listed on his credit bureau \nreport, Applicant contacted the new creditor in an effort to resolve this account. The \ncreditor was unable to find any account in Applicant\u2019s name under either the old loan \nnumber with the first mortgage lender or under the new loan number that was listed on \nthe credit bureau report. After receiving the SOR in 2021 and again in July 2022, Applicant \ncontacted the currently listed creditor, with the same results. Applicant is willing and able \nto pay this debt in full. However, the debt was no longer listed on his 2019 recent credit \nbureau report. The three other SOR debts, that totaled $3,987, were paid in full. \n\u201cA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.)

He and his wife keep \na written budget to which they adhere. Applicant lives within his means, is current on his \nongoing financial obligations including his vehicle-loan payments and his mortgage-loan \npayments, and has a net monthly remainder. He is financially stable and has positive \nbalances in his checking and savings accounts and his multiple retirement accounts. His \nfailure to timely pay his tax obligations arose under unusual circumstances that were, in \npart, beyond his control and are unlikely to recur. He acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by contacting the IRS and voluntarily repaying his tax debt in its entirety. \nHe is always timely filed his tax returns. He has made multiple efforts to repay or otherwise \nresolve the outstanding mortgage loan. He has never been contacted by the creditor of \nthis debt and it no longer appears on his credit bureau report. He has the financial \nresources to repay this debt and is willing to do so. It is highly unlikely that this debt could \nbe a source of coercion or exploitation. He paid each of the other SOR debts. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant is financially reckless or \nirresponsible or that he is likely to disregard his financial obligations in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant\u2019s nearly 23 years as a security-clearance holder and his professional \nreputation of trustworthiness and reliability are indicative of a person who exercises good \njudgment. Security clearance adjudications are not meant to be punitive but rather are to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s current ability to properly handle and protect classified \ninformation. Ultimately, the record shows that Applicant has demonstrated the good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial issues. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.n. He asserted that the debts alleged in 1.c and 1.d had been resolved, and that the debts alleged in 1.e-1.n were no longer delinquent. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He was married in 2008. He has two minor children and two adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He owns an information technology company as a sole proprietor and does contract work for a government contractor. He started this business in 2010. He received his first security clearance in 2007. (Tr. 22-26; GE 1) The SOR alleges failure to file seven years of federal and state income tax returns, two delinquent credit card debts, and ten past-due student loans. The status of the allegations is as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013-2019. Applicant admitted these allegations. He stated that starting in 2013, he was irresponsible and failed to maintain a record of his business expenditures. He asserted that he requires this information to file his tax returns, because it will reduce his tax liability. During this time, he was a subcontractor, and no taxes or deductions were taken out of payments made to him by the prime contractor. Ap",

(Tr. 50-52, 76-77) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c -\n1.n. He asserted that the debts alleged in 1.c and 1.d had been resolved, and that the \ndebts alleged in 1.e-1.n were no longer delinquent. His admissions are incorporated into \nmy findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. He was married in 2008. He has two minor children and \ntwo adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006, and a master\u2019s degree in \n2010. He owns an information technology company as a sole proprietor and does contract \nwork for a government contractor. He started this business in 2010. He received his first \nsecurity clearance in 2007. (Tr. 22-26; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges failure to file seven years of federal and state income tax returns, \ntwo delinquent credit card debts, and ten past-due student loans. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2013-2019. Applicant admitted these allegations. He stated that starting in 2013, \nhe was irresponsible and failed to maintain a record of his business expenditures. He \nasserted that he requires this information to file his tax returns, because it will reduce his \ntax liability. During this time, he was a subcontractor, and no taxes or deductions were \ntaken out of payments made to him by the prime contractor. Applicant has not paid any \nfederal or state income taxes for tax years 2013-2019. He was told that he was required \nto make quarterly tax payments by his CPA but failed to do so. He claims that he will file \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013-2019 sometime in 2023, after he collects the \nnecessary business expense information for his accountant. These tax issues are \nunresolved.

He \nprovided two unsigned and undated federal income tax returns showing that he owed \n$36,606 and $30,728 for these years, respectively. He did not submit any documentary \nevidence regarding his state income tax returns for these years. During the hearing we \ndiscussed the insufficiency of the evidence provided, but he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation after the hearing showing that these returns had been filed or that any \npayments have been made to the IRS or the state. (Tr. 27-35, 77-102; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card account placed for collection for $7,750. This debt was \nsubsequently charged off. Applicant claimed that he had the bill for this account paid \nmonthly on autopay. He stated that he did not open the statements when he received \nthem. He claimed that at some point autopay stopped working and the creditor closed the \naccount for non-payment without his knowledge. He claimed that this debt has been paid, \nbut he did not provide sufficient documentation supporting that assertion. He did provide \na one-page document showing that he made monthly payments from November 2017 to \nMarch 2020, but it does not show the amounts paid or that there is a zero balance. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-38, 105-108; GE 2; AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit card account that has been charged off for $222. Applicant \nclaimed that he stopped using this credit card, but he was still charged an annual fee. \nSince he did not look at the statements, the fee was unpaid and the account was charged \noff. He claimed that this debt has been paid, but he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing that it is resolved. (Tr. 38-40,102-105; GE 2, 3, 4; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.n are past-due student loan accounts totaling $98,128. Applicant \nstated that these accounts are from his undergraduate and graduate education. He \nclaimed that he was behind on payments from about July 2017 to about May 2019 \nbecause his pay was delayed about three months after he started a new contract. He \nclaimed that after about three months, he resumed his regular monthly payment, and \ncaught up on his payments in about May 2019. He did not contact the lender to resolve \nthe issue. He claimed that the loans were put into the COVID-19 forbearance program \nafter March 2020. (Tr. 40-42, 97-102, 114; GE 2, 3) \nPost hearing, Applicant submitted a document showing his record of student-loan \npayments. It shows that he started repayment in April 2013 and made monthly payments \nuntil January 2017. In 2017, he missed payments for four non-consecutive months. In \n2018, he missed payments for five non-consecutive months. In 2019, he missed \npayments for three non-consecutive months and the loans were listed as 120 days or \ngreater past due on his credit report from that year. His last payment was in March 2020. \nHis February 2022 credit report shows the loans as current because they are in the \nforbearance program. (GE 3; AE J) \nApplicant did not provide documentation of his current finances, to include his \nmonthly income or expenses, or his savings. When questioned about these matters at \nthe hearing, he was evasive in answering some questions, and failed to provide requested \ndocumentation to substantiate his claims. He reported his gross income is about \n$250,000 yearly, and that his wife earns about $12,000 yearly.

Two of his children have cars from 2015 that he purchased for them. Every \nmonth, he puts money into his investments, in varying amounts. He reported taking three \nsignificant vacations in the last four years, including Europe in 2018, Mexico in 2020, and \nthe Caribbean in 2021. He and his wife own a home that they bought in 2014, which he \nasserts is now valued at almost $900,000. He is also an investor in a home which he \nclaims is valued at over $400,000. He has not had credit counseling. (Tr. 52-77; 116-118; \nGE 1; AE F)  \nApplicant submitted a professional character letter which stated that he is a skilled, \nreliable, and professional worker. He submitted a personal character letter in which the \nwriter stated that he was unaware that Applicant had any financial concerns or difficulties. \n(AE G, I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that his tax issues or delinquent credit card debts are resolved, or that any of \nalleged SOR debts became delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur. His failure to make consistent student loan payments is recent, and his failure to \nresolve his delinquent debts and timely file his income tax returns is long-term, ongoing, \nand unresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is insufficient evidence to show that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances beyond his control, and that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Although his student loans were apparently placed in \nthe COVID-19 forbearance program after March 2020, he did not have a consistent record \nof payments for about three years prior to the COVID pause, and he did not provide an \nadequate explanation about why his student loans accounts remained delinquent for so \nlong. Applicant provided insufficient documentary evidence to support his claims that he \nmade payments to bring his delinquent student loans to current status in 2019. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. The record shows that Applicant has not met his tax \nfiling obligations since 2012. He admits failing to file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2013-2019 and provided insufficient evidence that he filed income tax returns \nfor tax years 2020 and 2021. He has also testified that the prime contractor did not \nwithhold federal or state income taxes from payments made to him as a subcontractor \nduring this time period. Further, the record does not include sufficient evidence that he \nhas paid federal or state income taxes since at least 2012. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s long-standing and ongoing failure to file required \nfederal and state income tax returns, and his apparent failure to pay federal and state \nincome taxes due. I have also considered that he and his wife drive luxury cars, take \nexpensive vacations, and that he continues to fund his investment accounts, while \nignoring basic legal obligations with regard to his income taxes. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and serious doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a- 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. She graduated from high school in 2007, and she has attended some college courses. She studied to be a pharmacy technician but did not complete the certification because she could not afford the required unpaid externship. She married in 2010, at age 22, separated from her husband in June 2013, and the divorce was finalized a year later. She has three girls, ages 12, 6, and 8 months. She receives no child support from their fathers because she cannot locate them. (Tr. 29-33; GE 1; AE E) In 2010, Applicant was working in aviation for a small airline. She married and moved to another state with her husband, and was unable to transfer jobs. Her husband was from Africa. She sponsored his entry to the United States, in hopes that he would become a U.S. citizen. When they moved to the new state for his job, he was not able to provide financial support, so she sought employment in retail. (Tr. 45-46) Applicant had a variety of jobs until March 2015 when she began working for a large defense contractor and subcontractor, in State 1.

The \ncase was assigned to me on October 5, 2022. On October 31, 2022, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for December 5, 2022, by video-teleconference through an \nonline platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1, as well as GE 3 through GE 5, which I admitted without objection. (GE 2 \nwas provided to Applicant before the hearing and was marked, but was not offered or \nadmitted, and I have not considered it). Applicant testified but provided no documents. I \nheld the record open until January 5, 2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documents. She timely submitted an e-mailed narrative statement and five \ndocuments, which I marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through AE F, and admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 14, 2022. The \nrecord closed on January 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and she denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.i, all with brief \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. She graduated from high school in 2007, and she has \nattended some college courses. She studied to be a pharmacy technician but did not \ncomplete the certification because she could not afford the required unpaid externship. \nShe married in 2010, at age 22, separated from her husband in June 2013, and the \ndivorce was finalized a year later. She has three girls, ages 12, 6, and 8 months. She \nreceives no child support from their fathers because she cannot locate them. (Tr. 29-33; \nGE 1; AE E) \nIn 2010, Applicant was working in aviation for a small airline. She married and \nmoved to another state with her husband, and was unable to transfer jobs. Her husband \nwas from Africa. She sponsored his entry to the United States, in hopes that he would \nbecome a U.S. citizen. When they moved to the new state for his job, he was not able to \nprovide financial support, so she sought employment in retail. (Tr. 45-46) \nApplicant had a variety of jobs until March 2015 when she began working for a \nlarge defense contractor and subcontractor, in State 1. She worked there for about three \nyears, earning $35,000 a year. (AE A, AE B, AE C) She then returned to her home state, \nand worked at a computer help desk for a university health system. She was then self-\nemployed managing a cleaning service. That job is ongoing but the work is sporadic. (Tr. \n36; GE 1; AE A) \nBetween January 2019 and early 2021, Applicant made between $20 and $24 an \nhour in a job in the defense industry. She then worked for a large contractor as a project \nmanager and cyber-security specialist, with an annual salary of about $76,000 or \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$80,000. She worked in that job for about a year. She then became a cyber-security \nanalyst earning $107,000 annually, until February 2022, when she likely lost her interim \nclearance after the SOR was issued. Her youngest daughter was born a month later. (Tr. \n33-42; GE 1; AE A, AE D, AE F) \nSince February 2022, Applicant has had only sporadic employment. She was \nunemployed until June 2022, when she took a job as a security guard, making $16 an \nhour, full time. That job ended in mid-October 2022, about six weeks before the hearing, \nand she remains unemployed, though sponsored for a clearance. (Tr. 39-42) \nThe SOR allegations concern nine delinquent debts, totaling about $45,000. The \ndebts are established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 2018, August 2019, \nand December 2019, as well as Applicant\u2019s SCA, on which she disclosed numerous \ndebts. (GE 1, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($20,429) is a charged-off debt relating to a repossessed auto. SOR \u00b6 \n1.c ($9,112) is a past-due account relating to another repossessed auto, purchased at \nthe same time. Applicant purchased the cars in State 1 after she moved there with her \nhusband. The car relating to SOR \u00b6 1.c, purchased in 2015, was a gift for a friend. She \nsaid she had settlement offers for both debts, for either $2,000 or $3,000, and planned \non paying them. She has not been able to do that due to her employment instability and \nfamily situation. (Tr. 49-54, 57-61; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5) As of December 2019, she had \nanother auto account, with the same creditor as for SOR \u00b6 1.c, with over $15,000 due \n(though current at the time). (GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,898) is an account placed for collection related to educational \nexpenses for a trade school. This is an education debt that Applicant incurred while \npursuing certification as a pharmacy technician. Her then husband said he would pay \nthose expenses but did not do so. She had to use student loans instead. She was on a \nre-payment plan of $5 a month between 2018 and 2012 but the account is again \ndelinquent and unresolved. (Tr. 32-33, 59-61; GE 3; GE 4; AE A) As of December 2019, \nApplicant also had almost $26,000 in federal student loans. (GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,222) is an account placed for collection relating to unpaid rent from \nan apartment in State 1 that Applicant and her then husband lived in when they were \nthere. He told her he would pay it, but instead he just moved out. She was unable to afford \nthe rent alone. The debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 52; GE 3; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($1,438), 1.f (387), and 1.i ($115) are debts placed for collection, for \npast-due telephone or cell phone accounts. The collection agency is the same for each \naccount, but the debts involve three different phone companies. SOR \u00b6 1.g ($255) is a \ndebt placed for collection by the city in State 1 where Applicant moved with her then \nhusband. SOR \u00b6 1.h ($224) is a medical debt placed for collection. Applicant denied these \ndebts and believed she had paid them. She did not provide documentation of any \npayments.

Due to her recent \nunemployment, Applicant has depleted her retirement and other savings. She is \ndependent on support from friends and family to make ends meet. She has not been able \nto pay rent since May 2022, and at the time of the hearing, she was facing possible \neviction. (Tr. 62-66) \nAfter her hearing, Applicant provided a narrative statement by e-mail (AE A), her \ndivorce decree (AE E) and several documents regarding offers of employment at prior \njobs. (AE B, AE C, AE D, AE F) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out, in pertinent part, in AG \n\u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies going back several years. The \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant has several large debts that are several years old. She purchased cars, \neither for herself or for a friend, that she could not afford. The cars were repossessed. \nShe married young, moved to a new state with her husband, who said he would provide \nfor her but did not. The marriage soon ended. To her credit, she managed to find \nemployment in the defense industry in that locale, but she also became financially \nextended, with expenses she could not pay. She returned home and ultimately returned \nto the defense industry, making annual income of between $76,000 and $107,000. \nHowever, she either did not, or could not, resolve many of her debts. Her more recent \nemployment instability, and family situation, raising three young children including an \ninfant, has also kept her from addressing her debts in a significant way. Her debts are \ntherefore ongoing and continue to cast doubt on her current judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has experienced some employment instability and financial hardship, but \nshe also has a track record of spending beyond her means. She has not participated in \ncredit counseling, and her debts are not being resolved or under control. Despite apparent \nevidence that she made a good living in the defense industry until recently, she did not \nestablish, or document, any good-faith efforts to pay or resolve any of her delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant denied several debts, asserting that they have been paid, Several of \nthose debts no longer appear on more recent credit reports. However, she did not provide \nany documentation that the debts are paid, resolved, or that her disputes of responsibility \nare valid. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s prior experience in the defense industry. I also considered \nher marital hardship and the fact that her recent employment instability has had a \nsignificant detrimental effect on her finances and ability to make ends meet. But this does \nnot outweigh the security concerns relating to her financial delinquencies, which remain \nongoing. Applicant needs to address her debts in a responsible way by establishing a \ntrack record of steady payments towards her debts and a significant period of financial \nstability before she can be considered eligible for access to classified information. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(Tr. at 13-14) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 47, has been married three times. She was married to her first \nhusband from 1994 until they divorced in 2001, and to her second husband from 2005 \nuntil they divorced in 2011. In 2021, she married her third husband and assumed his last \nname. She has three children, one of whom is currently living. Her eldest daughter, who \npassed away the day she was born, would be 30 years old. Her son, who was killed in a \nsingle vehicle accident in February 2020, would be 28 years old. Her youngest daughter \nis 29 years old. Applicant earned her high school diploma in 1994. At various times not \nspecified in the record, she attended college courses to obtain certificates in her field. \nShe was steadily employed as a defense contractor by several employers from 2005 until \nAugust 2019, when she became unemployed. She remained unemployed until October \n2019, when she began working as a database administrator for her current employer. \nShe has maintained a DOD security clearance since 2006. (GE 1, 2; Tr. at 4, 15-19, 70-\n71) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts totaling $46,093. In her Answer, Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Each of the debts \nalleged in the SOR is established by Applicant\u2019s August 2019 credit report. (GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nApplicant took out two parent federal student loans ($12,000 in 2011, and $12,000 \nin 2013) to afford her daughter the opportunity to attend college. As of August 2019, the \ntwo student loans were in default status in an amount totaling $45,043, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Her daughter was the first in the family to attend college. Her daughter \ngraduated a year early from high school and went straight to college in 2011. Her daughter \nearned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014, an associate degree in 2019, and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2020. As of the hearing, her daughter was pursuing a second master\u2019s degree. \n(Tr. at 40-41, 62-67, 78-79) \nApplicant maintained that the student loans were not in delinquent status due to \nany intentional action on her part to avoid paying them.

She never made any payments because \nshe believed that her daughter had remained enrolled in a degree program from 2011 \nthrough March 2020. In March 2020, the loans became eligible for COVID-pandemic \nrelated relief through September 2023. (Tr. at 22, 40-48, 59-60) \nIn November 2022, Applicant applied to rehabilitate the student loans to take \nadvantage of the U.S. Department of Education (DOE)\u2019s \u201cFresh Start\u201d program. On \nNovember 8, 2022, she paid $100 to start the loan rehabilitation process. The \u201cFresh \nStart\u201d program helps eligible borrowers get their loans out of default status and transferred \nto a new loan servicer with an income-driven repayment plan. In December 2022, \nApplicant was accepted into the program and the student loans were removed from \ndefault status and transferred to a new loan servicer. She had not yet received information \nabout the terms of the repayment plan. She planned to pay the student loans from her \nmonthly net remainder, which was $866 as of November 2022. She anticipated that she \nwill \u201cfind a way\u201d to pay the student loans should the monthly repayment plan amount \nexceed $866. (Tr. at 48-54, 61; AE A, O, J) \nApplicant did not learn of the delinquent status of the student loans until she \nreceived the SOR. Upon investigation, she learned that they became delinquent due to a \nchange in her daughter\u2019s enrollment status, of which she had not been aware. In \nNovember 2021, she obtained a record indicating that her daughter was not enrolled in \nschool between October 2017 and September 2018, and again between November 2019 \nand December 2019. The record indicated that her daughter was otherwise enrolled, at \nleast half time, from June 2017 through March 2020. Two 2019 credit reports indicated \nthat the student loans may have been in default as of July 2015. Applicant believed that \nher daughter was enrolled in school as of July 2015, but acknowledged that she \u201cdid not \nknow for certain.\u201d (Tr. at 42-43, 68; AE I at 2; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c involves a $599 medical bill incurred by Applicant on her behalf. Based \non conversations she had with her medical provider, she believed that the bill had been \npaid via her health savings plan (HSP), the same method she used to pay all bills she \nincurred with this provider. She continued to receive services from this provider after \nincurring the bill. She did not become aware that the bill had not been paid until she \nreceived the SOR. Two 2019 credit reports indicate that the debt was incurred in about \n2015 and placed for collection in about 2019. After investigating the matter, she learned \nthat, because the funds in her health savings plan were not sufficient to pay the entire bill, \nthe HSP denied the entire claim. By that time, the appeal deadline had passed so she \ndecided to pay the debt out of pocket. On November 9, 2021, she paid $674 to a collection \ncompany to resolve the debt in full. (Tr. at 29-34; AE B; AE I at 7; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \nSOR \u00b6 1.d involves a utility account Applicant asserted was reported in error.

Applicant denied owing the debt on the basis that she had \ncontinuous service with the same utility company since 1994 and had no known \ndelinquencies on her account. After learning of this debt when she received the SOR, she \ncontacted the utility company. She proffered a letter from the utility company, dated \nNovember 9, 2021, indicating that this account had been closed with a $0 balance upon \nreceipt of a $486 payment in March 2016. (Tr. at 34-37; AE C; AE I at 8; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e involves a $65 medical debt reported in collection status on two 2019 \ncredit reports. Applicant denied any knowledge of the alleged debt or any other known \ndelinquent medical debt. She received no letters, phone calls, or emails concerning a $65 \ndebt. She was unaware of this debt until she received the SOR. Both she and her attorney \nattempted to investigate the debt. However, neither were successful in obtaining any \ninformation to validate the debt. She was directed to a collection company that had gone \nout of business, and to information suggesting that the debt may be for services owed to \na known medical provider. However, she denied that she had any delinquencies on her \naccount with that known medical provider. Applicant is willing to pay the debt should she \nobtain information in the future that both validates the debt and confirms the payee. This \ndebt did not appear on her November 2022 credit report. (Tr. at 37-39; AE H; GE 3, 4) \n2011 Divorce \nApplicant attributed her 2011 divorce to her second husband having \u201cgone through \na lot\u201d after his younger brother was killed. She stated, \u201c[h]e got very sick and we had to \nget divorced.\u201d She was left with \u201cjust a ton of debt that was in both of our names,\u201d including \ntaxes, two mortgages, \u201cextensive\u201d credit-card debts, traveling expenses, and personal \nloans. Her second husband was not able to work at the time they divorced so, between \nabout 2011 and 2014, she was \u201cmaking all the payments on everything and just trying to \nlet him regroup and get some help that he needed to get.\u201d In 2014, when their niece \ntragically passed away, her second husband \u201cshowed up at the funeral and made \namends,\u201d and \u201cstarted helping me pay things back.\u201d By then, he had started a new \nbusiness in real estate and started financially helping \u201cthe kids, even my daughter with \nher tuition.\u201d (Tr. at 19-20) \nAt the hearing, Applicant maintained that all her 2011 divorce-related debts had \nbeen paid except for the taxes. However, she could not recall when the non-tax debts \nhad been finally resolved or how much she paid to resolve them. After the hearing, she \nreported that she made monthly payments, totaling $1,201, for an unspecified period, \ntowards the debts she had been assigned to pay in her 2011 divorce decree. Those debts \nincluded six credit-card debts (which then totaled $32,377) and one private student loan \nthat she took out on behalf of her son (which then totaled $37,500). (Tr. at 19-20, AE Q) \nTaxes \nOn her 2016 SCA, Applicant reported that she failed to pay 2012 federal and state \nincome taxes in the approximate amount of $3,000.

She asserted that she \nnever missed an installment agreement payment, and was up to date with her federal and \nstate tax income return filings. (Tr. at 54-55, 57, 68-69) \nAfter the hearing, she proffered documents corroborating that she made timely \npayments from June 2017 through December 2022, totaling $13,810, pursuant to an \napproved payment plan towards her delinquent state tax debt; and timely payments from \nJanuary 2018 through December 2022, totaling $8,250, pursuant to an approved payment \nplan towards her delinquent federal tax debt. As of January 2019, the balance of \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debt for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2014 through 2016, totaled \n$38,542, including a failure-to-pay penalty and interest (the breakdown was as follows: \n$16,147 for 2011, $8,307 for 2013, $6,814 for 2014, $4,47 for 2015, and $2,827 for 2016). \nAs of September 2022, the balance remaining on her state tax debt was $378. The record \ndid not indicate for which tax years her state tax debt related. As of January 2023, the \nbalance remaining on her federal tax debt was $26,504 (the breakdown was not indicated \nin the record). Her 2022 federal tax refund of $4,000 was applied to her federal tax debt. \nThe record did not indicate whether her state or federal debt had ever been considered \nin delinquent status, neither were they alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 69, 81-82; AE K, L, N) \nIncome and Expense History \nApplicant did not earn any income during her unemployment between August and \nOctober 2019. Prior to being laid off in October 2019, she earned an annual salary of \n$87,000. As of the hearing, her annual income increased over time to $97,000, and her \nthird husband was earning a monthly income of $4,963. She has about $2,000 in her \nsavings account (which had been reduced by the amount she used to replace a damaged \nwindshield on her car and the increased price of her home\u2019s oil heat). She has about \n$14,000 in her 401K account. (Tr. at 52, 54-55, 57, 70-72, 84-85) \nApplicant attributed her financial strain to circumstances beyond her control \nincluding her divorce, financially supporting her children, the tragic passing of her son and \nclose colleagues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. She acknowledged that these \ncircumstances contributed to her lack of attention to the student loans.

She continued to support her son and his family, including financially and otherwise, \nafter her second grandchild was born in October 2018, and until they moved out and into \ntheir own home in February 2019. She was their primary financial provider during the \nperiod they resided with her. In addition to not charging them rent, she provided them with \nfood, utilities, diapers, and whatever else they needed. Her son was employed and \nfinancially \u201chelped out when he could,\u201d but his girlfriend did not earn any income. Her \nfinancial support included subsidizing prescriptions which her son\u2019s insurance did not fully \ncover. The out-of-pocket cost for those prescriptions, which her son needed to treat a \nchronic illness with which he had been diagnosed in January 2017, was \u201cat least a couple \nhundred a month.\u201d After his son\u2019s girlfriend misappropriated the funds raised to pay for \nthe funeral, Applicant paid about $14,000 for her son\u2019s funeral. She spent \u201ca little over a \nyear and a half\u201d administering her son\u2019s estate for which she spent an unspecified amount \nof money on fees and expenses. Her ex-husband also contributed an unspecified amount \ntowards those fees and expenses. (Tr. at 19-28, 45-48, 63, 69, 74-75, 77; AE P) \nBetween 2017 and 2018, Applicant went on short-term disability three times, which \nreduced her income. She could not recall \u201cthe total time\u201d she took off on each occasion. \nInitially, she took leave for about six weeks to attend to her ill son. Then, she twice took \nleave for \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d each time to attend to her mental health which had suffered \nfollowing the tragic passing of four of her colleagues. She and her co-workers, whom she \nalso considered friends, were \u201call very close,\u201d and were negatively affected by the events \nsurrounding those deaths. On each occasion that she was on short-term disability, she \nreceived either 35 or 65 percent of her pay. (Tr. at 24-28, 75-76) \nApplicant\u2019s November 2022 credit report revealed four active credit cards (opened \nbetween 2014 and 2019), with balances of $1,073, $2,825, $1,354, and $6,324; and four \nloan accounts (opened between 2020 and 2022) with balances of $10,891, $20,269, \n$17,383, and $11,388. All the accounts were reported in good standing. No new \ndelinquent debts were reported. Applicant used the credit cards to pay for gas, emergency \nexpenses, and unspecified other expenses. She used the $11,388 loan to help finance \nher son\u2019s funeral and pay unspecified expenses; and the $17,383 loan to finance a \nrecreational vehicle (RV) she used to visit her daughter in lieu of staying in hotels that did \nnot allow dogs. As of the hearing, since she no longer needed it, the RV was for sale for \nan amount sufficient to cover the balance of the loan. The purpose of the other two loans \nwere not indicated in the record. (AE H; Tr. at 86-89) \nApplicant attended one financial counseling session in connection with the \nadministration of her son\u2019s estate. She currently maintains her finances by using a budget, \nwhich she implemented in about 2017. She learned how to set up a budget via a program \nthat her son purchased. She pays all her bills via bi-weekly automatic payments.

(Tr. at 58) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro.

(ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the debts alleged in the SOR are currently in delinquent status. At no time \ndid Applicant intentionally disregard her financial obligations. She proffered a reasonable \nplan to repay the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. She paid the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c in November 2021. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was resolved in March \n2016. She established a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, which did not appear on her November 2022 credit report. \nI, sua sponte, took administrative notice of the fact that, beginning March 13, 2020, \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOE has been providing emergency relief for federal \nstudent loans, including the suspension of loan payments and collections on defaulted \nloans. On August 24, 2022, President Biden extended this COVID-19 relief through \nDecember 31, 2022. On November 22, 2022, the DOE announced an extension of the \npause on federal student loan repayment, interest, and collections, to sometime in 2023. \nOn June 7, 2023, after the U.S. Congress passed a law preventing further extensions of \nthe pause, the DOE announced that interest payments will resume starting September 1, \n2023, and payments will be due starting in October 2023. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic pause mitigates Applicant\u2019s post-pandemic inaction on \nthe student loans. Her inaction before the pandemic is mitigated by circumstances beyond \nher control. Applicant credibly testified that she reasonably assumed that the student \nloans were in deferment status given what she believed was her daughter\u2019s continuous \nenrollment in a degree program. As of December 2022, the student loans were removed \nfrom default status. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant demonstrated a track record of responsible action, through her \nconsistent payments towards her divorce-related debts, including federal and state \nincome taxes, that leads me to conclude that she will follow through with her plans to \nrepay the student loans and avoid any future indebtedness. Although Applicant continues \nto rely on credit accounts to meet her expenses, she is current on each of those accounts. \nShe has not incurred any new delinquent debts. I conclude that her finances are under \ncontrol and attributable to circumstances unlikely to recur. I have no lingering doubts \nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(e) apply to \nmitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 52-year-old aircraft mechanic for a government contractor, employed since 2018. In 2015, she was laid off from her job while her youngest son was living at home. She supplemented her income with unemployment insurance and a lower-paying job. She did not complete high school. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2005. She again married in 2016 and divorced in 2018 after a short marriage in which she described as a \u201chorror of a marriage.\u201d (Tr. 19) She has three adult children. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has ten delinquent debts including loans, a mortgage, legal fees, credit cards, a medical debt, and a telephone service account; all totaling over $25,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j). Applicant admitted all of the 2 debts with some explanations, except she denied a small credit account (SOR \u00b6 1.j), claiming it was paid. The evidence submitted by the Government supports the SOR allegations. Applicant attributed her financial problems to being laid off in 2015 and her divorce in 2018. She struggled financially since 2015, until she secured a well-paying position with her current employer in 2018 where she earned almost twice her previous job. (Tr. 24-28) SOR \u00b6 1.a is a personal loan that was originally a $30,000 auto loan in her son\u2019s name, for a vehicle for his use. She refinanced the loan in her name to help him, but could not afford the payments after she was laid off. The car was sold in 2016, and the balance was partially paid off.",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nProcedural Rulings \nThis is a security clearance case in which the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Appeal Board remanded the case to me on January 12, 2023, to \nconsider post-hearing evidence that was not previously forwarded to me and therefore \nnot considered in my initial decision. My initial decision in this case concluded that \nApplicant had a history of financial problems and a number of delinquent debts, and that \nshe did not provide sufficient evidence of efforts to resolve debts. I then concluded she \ndid not present sufficient evidence to rebut, extenuate, mitigate, her financial \ndelinquencies and decided the case against her. Applicant appealed that decision to the \nAppeal Board. \nThe Appeal Board noted in its remand decision, that Applicant claimed to have \ntimely submitted post-hearing documentation to Department Counsel in accordance with \nmy direction at the hearing, however that information was not included in the record at \nthe time of my decision of November 28, 2022.

After \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing evidence, I conclude that Applicant has \nsufficiently mitigated the Guideline F security concerns raised in the SOR. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 4, 2019. \nOn April 10, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 2, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 19, 2022. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 30, 2022, scheduling the hearing for October 24, 2022. The hearing was held \nvia video teleconference as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not submit exhibits at the hearing. The record was \ninitially held open until November 5, 2022, for Applicant to supplement the record. As \nstated above, Applicant timely submitted post-hearing information that was not \nconsidered in my initial decision, but will be considered in this remand decision. Applicant \nalso submitted supplemental information as a result of her appeal and remand, and I have \nconsidered that evidence as well. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 3, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 52-year-old aircraft mechanic for a government contractor, employed \nsince 2018. In 2015, she was laid off from her job while her youngest son was living at \nhome. She supplemented her income with unemployment insurance and a lower-paying \njob. She did not complete high school. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2005. She \nagain married in 2016 and divorced in 2018 after a short marriage in which she described \nas a \u201chorror of a marriage.\u201d (Tr. 19) She has three adult children. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has ten delinquent debts \nincluding loans, a mortgage, legal fees, credit cards, a medical debt, and a telephone \nservice account; all totaling over $25,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j).

The evidence submitted by the Government supports the SOR \nallegations. Applicant attributed her financial problems to being laid off in 2015 and her \ndivorce in 2018. She struggled financially since 2015, until she secured a well-paying \nposition with her current employer in 2018 where she earned almost twice her previous \njob. (Tr. 24-28) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a personal loan that was originally a $30,000 auto loan in her son\u2019s \nname, for a vehicle for his use. She refinanced the loan in her name to help him, but could \nnot afford the payments after she was laid off. The car was sold in 2016, and the balance \nwas partially paid off. The loan was converted to a personal loan for $8,715. Applicant did \nnot make regular payments on the loan after 2016, and it was charged off. Applicant\u2019s \nson stopped paying on the loan after being laid off, and does not contribute to repayment \nof the personal loan. In October 2022, Applicant arranged a repayment plan with the \ncreditor, and she started making $25 payments every two weeks, beginning November \n4, 2022, in accordance with the agreement. (AE I) She testified that she has been faithfully \nmaking the scheduled payments and restated in January 2023 that she would continue \npayments as agreed. (AE A) This account is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit union line of credit collection account for $7,672. Applicant \nused the loan for home repairs in about 2015. She initially made payments, but stopped \nin 2016. She spoke with a credit union representative in 2019 and October 2022, who \ndemanded payment in full. She did not have the funds to pay the full debt. Based on her \ntestimony and post-hearing submission (AE F), it appears that Applicant was able to \narrange a payment plan in November 2022, whereby she would deposit $25 per month \ninto an account with the credit union for that purpose, and the credit union would apply it \ntoward the loan. (AE F) She noted in an email that she will continue to pay on this account. \n(AE A) This account is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a past-due mortgage that incurred late fees totaling $3,214. Applicant \ntestified that she began making payments in October 2021 and is paying an extra $25 per \nmonth toward her late fees. Her most recent credit report shows the mortgage is up to \ndate. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit union personal loan that has been charged off for $2,792. \nApplicant testified that she was able to arrange a repayment plan about six months ago, \nand began making $25 payments every two weeks, beginning about four to five months \nago. She provided a post-hearing document showing a payment of $25 on November 4, \n2022, and a balance of $2,250 that shows a decreasing balance on the account. (AE G) \nShe also noted in an email that she will continue to pay on this account. (AE A) This \naccount is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a telephone account debt for $766. Applicant claims her new \ntelephone carrier was to pay off this account when she switched, but failed to do so. She \ndisputed the account several years ago, and it is no longer reflected in her current credit \nreport.

Appellant agreed to accept an \nattorney\u2019s services to assert a claim for an unclaimed money account. She received about \n$2,000 in 2016, but failed to pay the attorney\u2019s fee. In her post-hearing submission, she \nprovided documentary evidence that she settled the account in December 2022, and paid \nthe debt in full. (AE B and AE D) This account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a medical debt for $528. The medical debt resulted from a surgery in \n2005. She testified that she has taken no action to resolve the debt, and did not submit \nany post-hearing documents regarding the debt. In an email, she alluded to accounts in \nwhich she had not received a response to her calls. This was apparently one of those \naccounts. The debt is no longer reflected on her most recent credit report, and standing \nalone, does not give rise to a security concern. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are charged-off credit accounts. Applicant testified that she \npaid the accounts after she answered the SOR. In her post-hearing submission, she \nprovided evidence that these accounts were settled in full in March 2022 and March 2021, \nrespectively. (AE E, AE H, AE K, AE L) Both accounts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a charged-off credit account for $414. Applicant testified that she paid \nthe account after she answered the SOR. In an email, she alluded to accounts in which \nshe had not received a response to her calls. (AE E) This was apparently one of those \naccounts. The debt is no longer reflected on her most recent credit report. It appears to \nhave been resolved. \nApplicant stated that she received financial counseling in 2019 from a credit repair \nservice. The counselor did not assist her with a budget, but she claims she currently has \na written budget. She has no savings and about $417 in checking accounts. She owns a \nhome valued at about $310,000, with a remaining mortgage balance of about $50,000. \nShe is preparing her home to eventually offer for lease or sale. She rents another home \nfor $650 per month. She has about $300 in net monthly remainder. She contributes \ntoward her youngest son\u2019s tuition and pays his car insurance. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

She was supporting her youngest son at the time. Before \nshe began her current employment in 2018, she did little to address her debts. While this \nimpugns her history of financial responsibility, she did not have the financial means or \nunderstanding to tackle her mounting debts. Once she gained employment with her \ncurrent government contract position, she was able to get back on a solid financial footing \nover time. Moreover, when she learned that obtaining a security clearance was in \njeopardy because of about $25,000 in delinquent debts, she undertook significant action \nto address this relatively manageable amount of debt. \nAs a result of the issuance of the SOR and her hearing in this case, Applicant made \nsubstantial efforts to get a handle on her debts, contact all of her creditors, and resolve \ndebts or obtain payment plans and begin payments toward their final resolution. Although \nlate, I am satisfied that Applicant now fully understands the importance of keeping up with \nher debts, and taking action to resolve delinquent accounts as soon as financially feasible. \nApplicant\u2019s work to resolve her delinquent accounts has mitigated the financial \nconcerns and her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are no longer in \nquestion. She has financial assets including equity in a home, a positive net remainder, \nand newfound financial acumen. I trust that Applicant will continue to honor the remaining \nrepayment arrangements she has made and will refrain from further delinquencies. Also, \nshe stated that she received financial counseling and utilizes a written budget, which \nshould contribute to good financial management in the future. Mitigating conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (c), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s life circumstances, in particular her divorces, job loss, and underemployment. \nI am now convinced of her overall financial responsibility through her recent efforts to \nresolve delinquent debts, and I believe that she will timely meet her financial obligations \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On March 7, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on March 22, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until April 24, 2023, to enable her \nto submit additional documentary evidence. At her request, the deadline for submitting \nadditional evidence was extended to May 10, 2023. She timely submitted AX G through \nAX J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March \n31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old program analyst employed by defense contractors since \nDecember 2005. She received a security clearance in November 2008. \nApplicant was a teacher from June 2002 until she was hired by a defense \ncontractor.

Shortly after Applicant \nmarried, she discovered that her then husband was an abusive alcoholic and an addicted \ngambler. \nIn May 2009, as Applicant was driving to work at a Navy facility, she was rear-\nended by a 19-year-old man who was texting while driving. She suffered severe back \ninjuries that required extensive surgical repair. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at \u00b6 6) As a result \nof her injuries, she is unable to stand for long periods of time, and her ability to move \naround is limited. (Tr. 65) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, age 18, is autistic and has a sensory processing disorder, \ncombined attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, \noppositional compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression. She functions at the level of \nage 12 or 13. (Tr. 15) \nApplicant\u2019s special-needs daughter was mauled by a dog in October 2009, with \nserious damage to her face. When Applicant\u2019s then husband arrived at the hospital, he \nwas drunk, and he told Applicant that she should be taking care of him instead of her \ndaughter. This event solidified Applicant\u2019s decision to end the marriage.

(GX 1 at 28-29; Answer to SOR, \nTAB C at \u00b6 5; Tr. 34) \nIn 2012, Applicant met and began cohabitating with a retired Navy pilot. In 2013, \nshe sold her townhouse so that she and her cohabitant could build a new house. She \nassumed that the new house would be titled in both names, but she later learned that it \nwas titled only in the cohabitant\u2019s name. Without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, he used a \nkeystroke tracker to take over their finances, open credit-card accounts in her name \nwithout her knowledge, and gain access to her savings and retirement accounts. As their \nrelationship continued, her cohabitant became physically abusive. She left her cohabitant \nin early 2015, and he stalked her repeatedly until she obtained a protective order against \nhim. (GX 2 at 3-5; Answer to SOR, TAB C at \u00b6 16 and 17) \nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant and her ex-husband were involved in extensive \nlitigation regarding custody of their daughter and responsibility for her medical care. She \nestimated that she spent about $15,000 for legal fees. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at \u00b6 13\u00ad\n14) \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s pay was reduced by $30,000 per year when her employer lost \na contract. She was laid off and unemployed for about six weeks in June 2017. After she \nworked at a lower-paying job for about a year, she found another position at about the \nsame pay as her 2016 job. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at \u00b6 18) \nIn August 2019, the water main into Applicant\u2019s home broke and flooded the entire \nfirst floor. Her insurance had a $2,000 deductible, and she needed to take leave without \npay for three weeks to deal with insurance companies, the mortgage holder, and \ncontractors. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at \u00b6 19) The flood destroyed much of Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentation of her efforts to resolve her debts. (Tr. 73) \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts. The evidence concerning these debts \nis summarized below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Home mortgage loan past due for $3,850 with a balance of \n$240,958. A credit report dated June 13, 2022, reflects that this account is current. (GX \n4 at 7) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was in the process of refinancing this \nloan to lower her payments. (Tr. 43) The refinancing has been completed, but the record \ndoes not reflect how much her monthly payments were reduced. (AX H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Credit-card account placed for collection of $1,278. Applicant \ntestified that this debt was incurred for veterinary services for her pets. She and her \ndaughter have volunteered for an animal rescue program for pets that have disabilities \nthat keep them from being adopted. They currently have eight cats. Caring for the cats is \ntherapy for her daughter. (Tr. 78) Now that Applicant\u2019s income has returned to its previous \nlevel, she has been able to resolve this debt. The creditor has agreed to settle this debt \nfor $703, to be paid in monthly installments of $234, beginning in July 2023.

(GX 4 at 9) Applicant testified that \nshe does not recognize this debt, but it probably is a credit card that her ex-cohabitant \nopened in her name. (Tr. 45) She was afraid to dispute this debt because it would involve \ncontacting her ex-cohabitant. The creditor has agreed to settle the debt for $1,600, to be \npaid in three monthly payments. Applicant made the first payment of $600 on April 24, \n2023.

The account is current. \n(AX G at 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Credit-card account placed for collection of $14,366.

Applicant \ntestified that this credit card was solely in her name. (Tr. 47) She testified that she \nreceived a settlement offer about two weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 75) In a post-hearing \nnarrative, she stated that a customer-service representative for the creditor informed her \nthat the creditor had filed an IRS Form 1099 for the entire balance, but that it was willing \nto reduce the balance to $1,454, to be paid in 11 monthly installments. Applicant was \nunable to obtain documentary confirmation of this conversation by the date the record \nclosed. (AX J at 6) \nA program manager for a defense contractor has known Applicant since May 2017 \nand is familiar with her family situation and her daughter\u2019s medical issues. He has found \nher to be meticulous in safeguarding classified information and trustworthy in completing \njobs competently and on time.

(Tr. 76) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and \nnumerous, but they were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. Applicant encountered several \nconditions largely beyond her control: a marital breakup in in 2009, followed by costly and \ncontentious litigation about custody and child support; a disabling injury in 2009; the birth \nof a special-needs daughter; a pay reduction; temporary unemployment and \nunderemployment; serious flooding of her home and uninsured property losses; and \nfraudulent conduct of a cohabitant. She has acted responsibly by seeking financial \ncounseling, systematically undoing the thievery of her former cohabitant, staying in \ncontact with creditors, and systematically paying or making payments to her creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. She has \nsteadfastly overcome an array of adverse events beyond her control. She naively became \nthe victim of an unscrupulous cohabitant, but she has learned from her experience and \nrebounded from it. I am satisfied that her financial problems are behind her and will not \nrecur. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

(Tr. 23-27, 28-38, \n43-55; Answer; GE 2, 3; AE A) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income taxes because he procrastinated \nand because he thought he would owe more in taxes than he could afford to pay. He \nattributed his inability to pay his financial delinquencies to his stepdaughter\u2019s special \nneeds and the costs associated with her care. His financial situation worsened when his \nwife stopped working in 2016 to take care of his stepdaughter full time. His wife also has \nchronic medical conditions that keep her from working. His stepdaughter\u2019s medical \ncondition will require full-time assistance for the rest of her life.

While he late filed them in June 2023, he did not timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for the 2019 through the 2021 tax years, as required. He \nowes about $45,000 in delinquent federal taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years. He \nalso believes that he owes delinquent federal taxes for the 2019 tax year, but he does \nnot know the amount. He does not have a payment plan in place to resolve these \ndelinquent federal taxes. He is no more than three payments past due on his mortgage, \nand he has an additional collection account in the amount of $10,180 for an unsecured \nloan that he opened in November 2021.

(Tr. 58-63; GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

However, the \nremainder of his financial issues are more problematic. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has settled several of his delinquent accounts, he has not made \nany payment on his three largest delinquent accounts. He late filed his outstanding \nfederal income tax returns, but he did so well after he began the clearance process, \nundermining his efforts to show that he did so in good faith. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). He owes a significant amount of delinquent \nfederal taxes and does not have a payment arrangement with the IRS. He is late on two \nother accounts that were not listed in the SOR. His financial issues are ongoing, and he \nhas not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nApplicant acknowledged that procrastination and his belief that he might not be \nable to afford his tax bill caused his failures to timely file his federal income tax returns. \nThese conditions were not largely beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies, as \nApplicant has now filed his late income tax returns. However, the timing of these filings \nand his delinquent taxes preclude full applicability of that mitigating condition. None of \nthe mitigating conditions fully apply to his failure to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns or the financial delinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j through 1.l. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant \nreceived a copy of the FORM on August 10, 2022. (Item 7) That day, he emailed a four-\npage reply. The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 28-year-old, married man. He earned a high school diploma in 2013 \nand an associate degree in 2015. Since 2018, he has been working for a defense \ncontractor as an insulator. \nApplicant has experienced financial stress over the course of several years that has \ncaused him to incur approximately $26,000 of delinquent debt, composed primarily of \nstudent loans. (Item 3 at 34-36; Item 5 at 3-5) He attributes his financial problems to \nimmaturity. Applicant contends that he has been satisfying his debts in $500 monthly \npayments and that he has reduced the balance to approximately $10,000. (Item 7) He did \nnot specify when he began making these payments, nor did he provided any documented \nproof of these payments. Applicant also asserts that he now manages his finances \nresponsibly, uses credit cards only in case of emergencies, and has established a \nspending limit, which he does not exceed. (Item 4 at 9) He provided no evidence of a \nbudget, or nor evidence that he has ever received financial counseling. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \n(e) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant readily admits that his financial problems stem from poor spending \ndecisions related to immaturity, rather than to circumstances beyond his control. However, \nhe did not submit any evidence corroborating his claims that he is paying his student loans \nand managing his finances more responsibly. When assessing security clearance \nworthiness, it is reasonable to expect applicants to provide documentation supporting their \nefforts to resolve debts. (See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (June 7, 2021). Absent \nproduction of such evidence, none of the mitigating conditions apply, and Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and conclude that they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 1, 2022, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2022. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 14, 2022, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 8, 1011. The Government offered two exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered \nno exhibits, but testified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of \nbusiness on November 22, 2022, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \nsupporting documentation. Applicant submitted five Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to \nas Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A through E, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, 2022. \nProcedural Rulings \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of India. Department Counsel provided a 6-page summary of the facts, \nsupported by 5 Government documents pertaining to India, identified as HE 1. The \ndocuments provide elaboration and context for the summaries. \nApplicant had no \nobjection. (Tr. p. 16.) I took administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. \nGovernment reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to \nreasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 58 years old, married, and has two adult children. He has a Master\u2019s \nin Business Administration. He holds the position of Senior Chief Engineer with a \ndefense contractor. He is applying for a security clearance in connection with this \nemployment. \nApplicant was born in Calcutta, India in 1964. He came to the United States in \n1982, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. He married a woman from \nVietnam, and she is a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have two children who were born \nin the U.S. Applicant began working for his current employer in 1987, and has been \nwith the company for the past thirty-five years. He has never held a security clearance. \n1.a. \nApplicant owns a portfolio of investments in India that he estimates to be valued \nat approximately 2 million dollars. (Answer to SOR.) Those foreign investments are \ndiscussed below: \n1.b. \nApplicant co-owns an apartment in Mumbai, India, with his brother and sister.  He \nestimates that his one-third ownership share of the apartment is worth approximately \n$500,000. Applicant explained that his father originally purchased the apartment for his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmother to live in. Applicant\u2019s mother has passed away. In recent years, the apartment \nwas used to house his aging aunt and uncle who needed care, since there were a \ncouple of staff there who could help care for them. The house is not rented. (Tr. p. 38.) \nApplicant\u2019s brother also uses the apartment when he visits India, as the business they \nown also has an office in Mumbai. (Tr. pp. 38-39.) \n1.c. \nApplicant is co-owner, of a large company in India that does business with the \nGovernment in India. The business is a consulting engineering company that was once \nowned by Applicant\u2019s father. Applicant\u2019s father passed, and Applicant and his two \nsiblings inherited the business. The company provides independent assessments and \nguidance to owners and operators of steel mills in India. They also do studies for \nentities such as the World Bank or other organizations to establish feasibility of the \nprojects that they are considering. This engineering company provides services related \nto various engineering civil projects with an expertise in the ferrous metals industry. \nThere are also some projects in aluminum plants and other things due to the skill sets of \nthe engineers. This business does work with the Indian Government since the steel \nplants are owned by the Government. (Tr. p. 33.) The company is comprised of 800 \nemployees. \nThe total revenue of the company last year was 11.8 million dollars. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit C.) \nApplicant\u2019s brother is the Chief Executive Officer who operates and manages the \ncompany. He is domiciled in New York, and is a permanent resident of the U.S. \nApplicant is a Director of the company. He is involved in the company Board meetings \nabout three times a year, and handles other miscellaneous matters. \nApplicant also maintains about six foreign bank accounts in India, valued at a \ntotal of $247,000. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) Applicant has implied that \nthere was more money than this at some point as some of the money was repatriated to \nthe U.S., and is part of the holdings he has in the U.S. Applicant holds a significant \namount of stock in this company, namely 13,334 of a total 80,000 shares issued, which \nis about 16.7 percent of the stock. The monetary amount of this stock is unknown. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.) \nApplicant has about 24 million dollars in assets in the U.S., that include an \ninvestment account, two real properties, he and his wife\u2019s retirement savings accounts \nand his life insurance policy. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.) \nI have taken administrative notice of the information set forth in the Government\u2019s \nbriefs and supportive documents on the country of India. (HE1.) India is a multiparty, \nfederal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral legislature. The U.S. Department of \nState has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for India, advising U.S. nationals to exercise \nincreased caution due to crime and terrorism. Indian authorities report rape is one of \nthe fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred \nat tourist sites and in other locations. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, \ntargeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and \ngovernment facilities. India continues to experienced terrorists and insurgent activities \nwhich may affect U.S. citizens directly or indirectly.

India presents a significant \nand heightened security risk to the United States. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant has significant financial interests in India. \nHe, along with his two \nsiblings, are owners of a large foreign consulting engineering company in India that \ndoes business with the Indian Government. This business is not only lucrative, but \nthere is an emotional tie to the business since he inherited it from his father who once \nowned it. He also maintains six foreign bank accounts, and is co-owner of an apartment \nin India. Based upon the evidence presented, his financial interests in India raise \nserious security concerns and pose a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulations, pressure, or coercion. \nGiven the volatile situation that \nexists in India, and the nature of the job Applicant has, there could easily be a conflict of \ninterest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information and \nhis desire to protect his foreign company and his inheritance in India. \nUnder the \nparticular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is applicable. These foreign \nfinancial interests pose a significant security risk to the U.S. Government. Applicant is \nsubjected to a heightened risk of foreign influence, or exploitation, or personal conflict of \ninterest from these foreign business and financial interests. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;   \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the individual. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign business and \nfinancial interests in India poses a significant security risk. There is great potential for a \nconflict of interest. Although Applicant has significant assets in the U.S., some of these \nassets he was able to obtain with money he received from his foreign business and \nfinancial interests in India. In addition, his ownership in a foreign consulting engineering \ncompany that does business with the Indian government could result in divided \nallegiance, or could be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure the Applicant. Not to \nmention the many foreign contacts he must have and maintain to effectively perform his \nduties and responsibilities as Director of the company. Insufficient mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 8 has been established. His foreign business, foreign financial interests, and foreign \ncontacts pose a heightened security risk particularly relevant to this proceeding. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s substantial business and financial \ninterests in India pose a significant security risk to the U.S. Government that has not \nbeen mitigated under the particular facts presented in this case. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with \u201cvarying frequency\u201d from about September 2015 to at least September 2017. The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted access to classified information (SOR 1.a). The SOR further alleged that Applicant intended to continue using marijuana in the future (SOR 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant denied SOR 1.a \u201cdue to the term \u2018varying frequency,\u2019 which is ambiguous.\u201d He commented further that he \u201cwill explain more at the hearing.\u201d He also denied SOR 1.b without comments. In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana occasionally during the period September 2015 to September 2017. At the hearing, he testified that those dates were incorrect.

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 22, 2022. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2022. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on November 2, 2022, \nscheduling the case to be heard via TEAMS video teleconference on December 6, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered two documents \nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. GE 1 was admitted without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney objected to the admission of GE 2, which is a summary of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview conducted by a U.S. Government investigator on September 11, \n2018. I sustained counsel\u2019s objection. Applicant offered six exhibits, marked as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through F. I admitted his exhibits without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 13, 2022. \n(Tr. at 9-12.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 37 years old, married and has one young child. He and his wife are \nexpecting a second child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 and a master\u2019s degree \nin 2015. He has worked for a major DoD contractor for the last 14 years. Applicant\u2019s \nemployer has promoted him five times, and he is presently a manager. He received a \nsecurity clearance in 2009 and is seeking to renew his eligibility in connection with his \nemployment. (Tr. at 15-23; GE 1 at 12-20; AE A at 1-2.) \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that \nApplicant used marijuana with \u201cvarying frequency\u201d from about September 2015 to at least \nSeptember 2017. The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been \ngranted access to classified information (SOR 1.a). The SOR further alleged that \nApplicant intended to continue using marijuana in the future (SOR 1.b). In his Answer, \nApplicant denied SOR 1.a \u201cdue to the term \u2018varying frequency,\u2019 which is ambiguous.\u201d He \ncommented further that he \u201cwill explain more at the hearing.\u201d He also denied SOR 1.b \nwithout comments. \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana occasionally during the \nperiod September 2015 to September 2017. At the hearing, he testified that those dates \nwere incorrect. He said that his first use was in or about September 2017 and his last use \nwas sometime in the first half of 2018. The basis of this adjusted timeline is the fact that \nhe only purchased medical marijuana, actually \u201cedibles\u201d containing THC (Edibles), in his \nstate of residence from medical marijuana dispensaries using a process that requires a \ndoctor\u2019s medical marijuana \u201crecommendation.\u201d His purchases and uses of medical \nmarijuana, including Edibles, pursuant to this process are legal in the state in which \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant resides. He first received a recommendation letter from a doctor in his state on \nSeptember 20, 2017. He had never used marijuana in any form prior to obtaining this \nrecommendation. He also testified that he stopped using Edibles prior to submitting his \ne-QIP in July 2018. He estimated that he used Edibles less than 15 times during a period \nof about nine months. Applicant acknowledged that he held a security clearance at the \ntime he used Edibles. (Tr. at 24-28, 48-50.) \nApplicant sought a recommendation from a doctor to use medical marijuana \nbecause he believed it would help reduce his \u201cdebilitating\u201d symptoms of Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist has given him a \ndiagnosis of ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. For a year or two Applicant \nfollowed the advice of his psychiatrist and followed his treatment plan for Applicant, which \nincluded taking medication for his ADHD condition. Over that period, the psychiatrist \nadjusted Applicant\u2019s medication a number of times in an attempt to reduce his symptoms \nas much as possible with the medication. The medication never provided sufficient relief, \nand it had significant side effects that bothered Applicant. Prior to September 2017, \nApplicant was also under the care of a therapist. (Tr. at 27-33, 48-50.) \nApplicant asserted that his condition interfered with both his professional life and \nhis marriage. While searching for a better cure of his condition, he read about medical \nstudies that showed that marijuana could provide relief for individuals with ADHD or \nanxiety. He decided to seek the advice of a physician about the possibility of treating his \ncondition with marijuana. The physician gave him the recommendation letter that was \nrequired for Applicant to purchase marijuana at a state-licensed dispensary where his \npurchases would be legal under state law. He used the marijuana in the form of Edibles \nand found that the drug relieved his symptoms \u201cto a degree.\u201d It was more effective than \nthe medication prescribed by his psychiatrist, but it did not resolve his symptoms \ncompletely. It had the benefit of eliminating the side effects of the prescribed drug. (Tr. at \n31-35.) \nApplicant then switched to a new therapist who treated patients with Cognitive\nBehavior Therapy (CBT). Using the CBT techniques, Applicant learned from his therapist \nthat he could stop the cycle of his symptoms seriously interfering with all aspects of his \nlife. He decided to continue with CBT therapy, and he stopped using Edibles. Since he \nbegan with CBT therapy in 2018 after he prepared his e-QIP, he has not had an \nexperience of having his symptoms of ADHD or anxiety becoming \u201cout of control.\u201d As a \nresult, he does not intend to use marijuana in the future and has signed a statement \nconfirming that commitment. At the hearing, he retracted his statement in his July 2018 \ne-QIP that he may need to rely on marijuana in the future. He believes that his use of \nCBT techniques is a much more effective coping mechanism than prescription drugs or \nmarijuana. It is also important to him that CBT techniques have no side effects. (Tr. at 33-\n36; AE E.) \n \nApplicant also is planning to avoid marijuana in the future for two other significant \nreasons. One is that he became a father and wanted to become a proper role model for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis child. He wants his home to be drug-free. The other reason is that he is aware that \nunder Federal law his use of Edibles is illegal. At the time he used Edibles, he was aware \nthat their use was inconsistent with the responsibilities of a security clearance holder. He \nused Edibles only because he was afraid that his worsening condition, particularly his \nanxiety disorder, would seriously damage his marriage and his career if he did not get his \nmental health condition under control. He was hoping that marijuana would give him the \nrelief he needed. He understands that he exercised poor judgment. He testified that his \njudgment was \u201cprobably clouded by the feeling that I needed to do something quickly.\u201d \nHe acknowledged that he \u201cfailed to consider the consequences of [his] actions while [he] \nwas desperate to regain control of his mental health.\u201d He is committed now to complying \nwith his legal responsibilities. If he ever felt desperate again, he would take time off from \nwork and consult with his new psychiatrist and therapist. Moreover, he stated that he has \nfaith in his current psychiatric care team. (Tr. at 36-41.)  \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nAs noted, Applicant has had a highly successful career working for his employer \nsince graduate school. He has advanced in the company more quickly than most of his \npeers. He has been selected for several special advancement programs and has received \ncertifications following his completion of specialized courses. (Tr. at 17-18; AE A at 2; AE \nD at 1-15.) \nApplicant submitted eight reference letters from a supervisor, co-workers and \nfamily members. All of his references praise Applicant\u2019s intelligence, skills, and dedication \nto his employer and the United States. They attest to his integrity, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. He also submitted several performance reviews in which he was highly \nrated and praised for his excellent leadership skills, work ethic, and accomplishments. In \none review, he is described as one of the company\u2019s \u201csuperstars.\u201d (AE B; AE E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of drug use, establish AG \u00b6 25(a) and (f). The record evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s credible denial of any intent to use marijuana in the future, renders AG \u00b6 25(g) \ninapplicable. This evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s last drug use \noccurred more than four years ago and was under unusual circumstances. His \npsychiatrist\u2019s treatment plan and prescribed medications were failing Applicant. He \nbecame desperate for an effective treatment of his disabling anxiety and ADHD. He \nfeared that his condition was damaging his career and his marriage. Now that he has \nfound a drug-free alternative that is effective and legal under Federal law, his relatively \nbrief experimentation with Edibles has ended. It is highly unlikely that he will ever again \nuse an illegal drug for any reason. His past actions consuming Edibles was \u201cclouded\u201d by \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis condition, and his actions do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.

His statement \nacknowledges that any future involvement with drugs will be grounds for the revocation \nof his national security eligibility. \nIn my mitigation analysis, I have also taken administrative notice of the Security \nExecutive Agent \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to \nAccess Classified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December \n21, 2021 (Guidance). In her Guidance, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) noted the \nincreased number of states that have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. \nShe reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the importance of compliance with \nFederal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She \nprovided further clarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains \nrelevant to security clearance adjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that \nthe adjudicative guidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as \nSecEA\u2019s Guidance, in light of all pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, \nincluding the whole-person factors quoted above. I note that Applicant\u2019s use of Edibles \nwas knowingly inconsistent with Federal law and raises concerns about his behavior at \nthat point in time. I conclude, however, that Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concerns raised by his past use of Edibles.

Overall, the record evidence does not raise any questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

His continued employment is contingent on him obtaining a security \nclearance. He previously held a Secret security clearance when he was on active duty \nin the U.S. Navy, discussed below. \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1979. He was awarded an \nassociate\u2019s degree in November 1996. He has been married three times, the first \nmarriage was from 1982 to 1995, and the second marriage was from 1995 to 2001. \nBoth of those marriages ended by divorce. He married a third time in 2004. He has one \nadult biological child and five adult stepchildren. He served in the Navy from 1986 to \n1996, and was honorably discharged. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant disclosed his past drug use on his November 8, 2018. SF-86 (Item 3) \nHe said that he used marijuana between about May 1976 to about October 2018. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) He admitted the SOR allegation in his answer but offered no additional details. \n(Items 1, 2, 3) In his SF-86, Applicant stated that he used marijuana for anxiety and \ninsomnia. The \u201cnorm\u201d for him was to use marijuana at the end of the day as a sleep aid. \nHis doctor offered him \u201cpills\u201d for his anxiety and insomnia, but Applicant declined that \noption because he did not like pills, especially if they were addictive. He stopped using \nmarijuana when he was offered his current job. (Item 3) \nDuring his January 22, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, \nApplicant reiterated what he stated when completing his SF-86. However, he added that \nsince he stopped using marijuana in October 2018, he has no issue with anxiety or \ninsomnia and has no plans to use marijuana in the future. Getting this job was a second \nchance for him to get his life in order. He purchased his marijuana in small amounts for \n$20 through acquaintances, whose \u201cnames are unknown.\u201d He did not have a medical \nmarijuana card. Applicant smoked marijuana with his wife in the evenings. He claimed \nthat he does not associate with anyone who uses marijuana. Applicant has not \nundergone a drug assessment for drug dependency, nor has he participated in any drug \ntreatment program or counseling. Only his wife and security officials know of his \nmarijuana use, and he told the OPM interviewer that his use cannot be used for \nblackmail or coercion.

He denied this \nallegation in his SOR answer, stating \u201cno attempt to collect.\u201d He did not provide any \nfurther details regarding any efforts he made to resolve this situation. (Items 1, 2) \nThis delinquent SOR debt is established by an April 22, 2019 circuit court final \njudgment in favor of Applicant\u2019s mortgage company, and by his November 8, 2019 \ncredit report, which reports that this account went into foreclosure in 2015. (Items 4, 5) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 22, 2019 OPM interview, he stated that his property \nmanager remodeled a rental house belonging to Applicant without his authorization, \nwhich caused \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d for him. Additionally, his tenant was not able to pay \nher rent. Applicant estimated this situation began in 2014. Applicant was late on his \nmortgage because of these issues related to his rental house. (Item 6) \nApplicant also stated during that same OPM interview that his financial problems \nwere tied to events beyond his control because he was unemployed and had health \nissues which prevented him from making timely payments to his creditors. He has not \nsought financial counseling or debt consolidation services. He stated that he lives within \nhis means and no one can question his ability or willingness to pay his debts. (Item 6) A \nreview of Applicant\u2019s November 8, 2018 SF-86 reflects periods of unemployment from \nSeptember 2017 to February 2018; and August 2016 to November 2016. (Item 3) \nAs noted above, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.a in his answer, asserting that the \ncreditor had not attempted to collect the deficiency balance. He provided no evidence of \nhis own efforts or intentions to resolve the debt. SOR \u00b6 2.a is not resolved. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition).\u201d The record \nestablished this disqualifying condition, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two potentially mitigating conditions for Applicant\u2019s conduct: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For \nthe recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated:  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd.

May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nBy his own admission, Applicant has a 42-year history of marijuana use and \ninvolvement. His use began in 1976 and continued to October 2018, shortly before he \nsubmitted his SF-86. His motivation to stop using marijuana was his desire to pursue his \ncurrent employment, which requires him to have a clearance. An applicant who acts \nonly in the face of an \u201cimmediate threat to his own interests\u201d may \u201clack the judgment \nand self-discipline\u201d expected of a clearance holder. ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sept. 18, 2018) Applicant acquired his marijuana in small amounts \u201coff the street\u201d \nfrom persons with unknown names, and did not acquire a marijuana card when it \nbecame available in his state of residence. \nApplicant asserts that he has turned his life around, that he no longer wants to \nuse marijuana, and will not use marijuana in the future. Additionally, his assertions \nduring his OPM interview that he is drug-free and does not intend to use drugs in the \nfuture lack corroboration. While Applicant receives credit for self-reporting his past drug \nuse on his SF-86 as required, that alone is insufficient to mitigate his self-admitted 42-\nyear plus history of marijuana use. Accordingly, mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \nwarranted at this time. \nApplicant is able to receive partial credit for acknowledging his drug involvement \nand substance misuse under AG \u00b6 26(b), for disassociation with drug-using associates \nand contacts, and changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used under \nsubsections (1) and (2). However, given the length of his marijuana use and the relative \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nrecency of his disavowals of future use, mitigation of security concerns under Guideline \nH is not warranted. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these two disqualifying \nconditions requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s denial, the \nGovernment\u2019s credit report and final judgment demonstrate that Applicant failed to \nsatisfy his outstanding debt with his mortgage company. His assertion that his mortgage \ncompany did not attempt to collect the mortgage debt is not indicative of good faith or \nresponsible behavior on his part. It is also inconsistent with fact that the creditor \nobtained the April 22, 2019 court judgment for the deficiency balance. Furthermore, \nApplicant did not attempt to address this debt even after receiving his March 18, 2022 \nSOR and his August 25, 2022 FORM. \nSince the debt is established by the Government\u2019s evidence, Applicant has the \nburden to show what he is doing about it. Even though this is a single delinquent debt, it \ninvolves a substantial sum and remains an unmitigated financial security concern. \nConclusion \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guidelines H and F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context \nof the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is gainfully employed and is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting his longstanding drug involvement and substance misuse problems and \nindebtedness are being or have been addressed, doubts remain about his suitability for \naccess to classified information. Protection of the national interest is the principal focus \nof these adjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nmeet his burden to submit sufficient mitigating evidence to supplement the record with \nrelevant and material facts regarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. By failing to provide such information, and in relying on an \nexplanation lacking sufficient detail to fully establish mitigation, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and financial considerations security concerns remain. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 65 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1979\u00ad 1993. He earned his GED while in the Navy. He was married from 1982-2010, when he and his wife divorced, and he indicated that they separated several years earlier. He has one adult step-daughter. Applicant is a computer database developer.

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,334) and 1.d ($1,838) are debts in collection with the same \ncollection agency. SOR \u00b6 1.e ($796) is an account placed for collection. SOR \u00b6 1.f ($496) \nis a charged-off debt to a credit card company. SOR \u00b6 1.g ($217) is a charged off debt to \na credit union. SOR \u00b6 1.h ($159) is an account placed for collection by a gas company. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($136) is an account placed for collection by a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.j ($72) is a \nmedical debt placed for collection. (Items 1, 4) \nApplicant said most of the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d. 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j) had \nbeen paid in full. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.e without explanation. He said SOR \u00b6 1.h was \nincurred by his former wife but charged to his account. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c and said \nit was being resolved under a monthly repayment plan. (Item 1) He provided no \ndocuments to corroborate any of his assertions with his SOR response. He also did not \nrespond to the FORM, so he provided no updated information. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \nApplicant had a duty to file his annual state and Federal income tax returns in a \ntimely manner, and the fact that he did not do so for several years is a security concern. \nAs the Appeal Board has held, in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for several \ntax years, including 2006-2018, as alleged. This establishes AG \u00b6 19(f) specifically, as \nwell as, more generally, AG \u00b6 19(c). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are also satisfied by his \nvarious delinquent debts, established by his 2019 credit report. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are established by an October 2019 credit report \u2013 a \ndocument that is now over three years old. Applicant says most of them have been paid, \nbut he did not provide documentation to show it. It is his responsibility to provide \nindependent documentation of his assertions, such as evidence of payments, or a new \ncredit report showing updated status of the accounts. Applicant did not provide any \ndocuments in answering the SOR, and he did not respond to the FORM, so he did not \nmeet his burden of rebutting or mitigating the delinquent debts in the SOR. No mitigating \nconditions apply to his delinquent debts. \nIndependently, there is the matter of Applicant\u2019s unfiled federal income tax returns. \nApplicant has not filed his federal income tax returns, on time, or at all, since at least TY \n2006. The fact that he says he has money withheld from his pay by his employer, as a \nW-2 employee, even if true, makes no difference. He has an independent responsibility \nto file his federal income tax returns every year, and to do so on time. \nApplicant asserts that his tax filing failures began in 2006 when he and his wife \nseparated. He asserts, without support, that this caused a cascading series of problems, \nyear after year, on the premise that each of his tax filings are contingent on filing(s) in \nprior years. Applicant provided no documentation about any of this, nor did he provide \nany documentation to establish that any of his unfiled federal returns have now been filed, \neven belatedly. To whatever extent Applicant\u2019s separation had to do with the origin of his \ntax filing problems (something which is not established), that does not excuse his pattern \nof inaction for years afterward. Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns are ongoing and unresolved. \nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. He \nhas not shown any reasonable, good-faith efforts to resolve them. No mitigating \nconditions apply to his unfiled federal tax returns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor seeking eligibility for access to \nU.S. government classified information as part his job. He has not filed federal income \ntax returns for many years. He did not provide any documentation of any tax filings and \ngave little indication that he has undertaken any action to address his tax issues, even \nbelatedly. He is not an appropriate candidate for access to classified information. He also \ndid not establish that he has paid his delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations due to his delinquent debts and years of \nunfiled federal income tax returns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(SOR \u00b6 3.b) \nWork-related Misconduct \nIn 2011, Applicant was employed by Company A, a temporary staffing agency, \nand assigned to a technical writing project for Client. During the assignment, he realized \nthat he and other technical writers were having difficulty writing instructions related to \ntroubleshooting a particular device. Without permission from Client, Applicant tested the \ndevice to failure and made a video of the test to provide a visual aid to other technical \nwriters on the project. He then shared the video with others on the project, including \nClient\u2019s employees, who reported the video and its distribution. Client requested \nApplicant\u2019s removal from the project. Company A complied with the request but did not \nterminate Applicant\u2019s employment. Company A eventually reassigned him to a project \nwith a different client. There is no evidence that the video was against Client policy, or \nthat it contained proprietary or otherwise sensitive information. Nor is there any \nevidence that Applicant committed a security violation by making and disseminating the \nvideo. (Tr. 71-75; Answer) \nFamilial Relationships with Foreign Nationals \nApplicant\u2019s wife, his third, whom he married in 2011, is originally from Ukraine. \nThe United States established diplomatic relationships with Ukraine in 1991 when it \ngained independence from Russia. The United States attaches great importance to the \nsuccess of Ukraine as a free and democratic state with a flourishing market economy. \nU.S. policy is centered on supporting Ukraine in the face of continued Russian \naggression as it advances reforms to strengthen democratic institutions, fight corruption, \nand promote conditions for economic growth and competition.  (GE 1; HE IV) \nIn February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, claiming the area to be part of the \nRussian Federation. In September 2022, Russia occupied four more provinces in \nUkraine, and in February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a \nresult, the U.S. State Department issued Level 4 \u2013 Do not travel warnings, for both \ncountries. In Ukraine U.S. citizens must exercise diligence due to the potential for \nmilitary attacks, crime, and civil unrest. There are continued reports of Russian forces \nand their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for \ndetention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have \nalso been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to \nRussia or Belarus.

The U.S. Embassy in Russia also has limited ability to assist \nU.S. citizens in emergency situations. Due to sanctions imposed on Russia by the \nUnited States, U.S. credit and debit cards will not work in Russia and funds transferred \nfrom U.S. banking institutions may not be accessible by Russian banks, creating the \npotential for financial difficulty for U.S. citizens in Russia. Dual U.S. and Russian \ncitizens face additional risks, including Russia\u2019s refusal to acknowledge dual nationals\u2019 \nU.S. citizenship, denying their access to U.S. consular assistance, subjecting them to \nmobilization, preventing their departure from Russia, and possibly conscripting them \ninto military service. (HE V) \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016. Her mother and two \nadult sons are citizens and residents of Ukraine.

He disclosed them on the 2018 \nsecurity clearance application only as foreign nationals to whom he has provided \nfinancial support. He did not disclose them as relatives or other foreign nationals to \nwhom he is bound to by affection, influence, common interests, or obligation.

In response to the same question \non his August 2018 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed relationships \nwith eight sex workers. Five of the women were Russian citizens, one was from Latvia, \none from Syria, and one from Romania. He also disclosed providing over $32,000 in \nfinancial support to 11 foreign national sex workers, including over $14,000 to seven \nwomen he had never met. At the hearing, he estimated that he has provided at least \n$50,000 in financial support to these women between 2009 and 2018. (Tr. 30, 42; GE 1, \n3) \nApplicant has visited two sex workers based in Russia and Ukraine. He paid for \nat least two women to travel to the United States and other international cities. He \nadmits to buying gifts for these women, to include electronics, cosmetics, and clothing. \nHe funds these relationships with the survivor\u2019s benefits, approximately $39,000 \nannually, he received after his second wife died in 2009. He discussed these foreign \nnational contacts in October 2012 and December 2018 background interviews. At the \nhearing, Applicant admitted that as he was being investigated in 2018, he considered \nthe possibility that these relationships not only represented a potential security risk but \ncould also put his employment in jeopardy. Ultimately, he decided to continue the \nrelationships because he had disclosed them to the Government and they were \ntherefore out in the open. (Tr. 52-53; GE 4-5; Answer) \nAt the hearing, Applicant spoke of three incidents worth highlighting. In 2011, \nApplicant traveled to Russia to visit a woman with whom he had fallen in love. He \nbelieved she reciprocated those feelings. However, when he arrived in Russia, she \nrefused to see him without explanation. In another instance, Applicant loaned $3,000 to \na Russian sex worker to start a business. He testified that when the business didn\u2019t \n\u201ctranspire,\u201d he forgave the loan. It is unclear what he meant by \u201ctranspire,\u201d whether the \nbusiness failed or if the money was used for another purpose. He admits sending \nanother Russian sex worker $400 every two weeks for two years as financial support, \nas she pursued a case through the Russian court system over a real estate deal. In \n2016, Applicant paid for the same woman who he attempted to visit in Russia in 2011, \nto visit him in the United States. He paid the travel expenses for the woman and her \nmale companion, who accompanied her on each of the three outings Applicant had with \nher. Applicant testified that he was not sure of the relationship between the woman and \nher companion but assumed that he was her romantic partner. (Tr. 41-43) \nApplicant stopped engaging with Russian sex workers, citing his growing \ndispleasure with Russia\u2019s political position and ultimate invasion of Ukraine in February \n2022. He still provides occasional financial support to two women in Ukraine. He sent \none woman money to help her flee the country. He sends money to another woman \nliving in Dnipro, a heavily embattled area of Ukraine, just to help. In 2017, at the \nsuggestion of a coworker that he might like women from Colombia, he began soliciting \nsex workers based in that country.

He has told \nher that because the money is not marital property, he will continue to spend it as he \nchooses. At the hearing, he stated his intention to continue pursuing intimate \nrelationships with internet-based, foreign national sex workers and providing them \nfinancial support (Tr. 63): \nRegarding all these activities, I will simply say that they give me a joy that I \nhave not previously known in my life[,] and I do not apologize for them. \n(Tr. 19) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe Alleged Work-Related Misconduct does not Present a Disqualifying Security\nConcern. \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits that in 2011, while staffed on a temporary \ntechnical writing job, he made a video recording of a test of a client\u2019s device and \ndisseminated that video to others working on the project, without permission from the \nclient. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. (AG \u00b6 \n15) While Applicant\u2019s actions may have been ill advised, there is no evidence that he \nshared proprietary or sensitive information, or that he violated a written policy. His \nemployer resolved the matter as a human resources issue. There is no evidence that \neither the employer or the client treated the incident as a security violation. Furthermore, \nthe incident is an isolated event that occurred more than ten years ago. The incident \ndoes not constitute a security concern and is resolved in favor of the Applicant.  \n \nApplicant Mitigated the Security Concerns Raised by his Familial Relationships \nwith Residents and Citizens of Ukraine. \n[F]oreign contacts and interests . . .are a national security concern . . . if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure and coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) An assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign interest \nis located, including but not limited to, consideration of whether it is known to target U.S. \ncitizens to obtain classified or sensitive information, or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. (Id.) Given the geopolitical situation in Russian and Ukraine and the level of \ndanger posed to U.S. citizens and interests in both countries, the following disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of \nmethod with a foreign\u2026.friend, or other person who is a citizen of resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, the record contains sufficient evidence to mitigate concerns raised by \nany potential conflict of interests where Applicant\u2019s in-laws are concerned. Applicant \ndoes not have an independent relationship with his wife\u2019s sons or her mother. The \namounts of financial support he has provided to them are minimal and represent a \ncourtesy, not evidence of familial obligation or affection toward them. Furthermore, the \nrecord does not support a finding that bonds of obligation can be attributed to him \nthrough his relationship with his wife. \nWhile it is possible that his wife\u2019s son\u2019s and her mother could be subject to \nexploitation by the Russian or the Ukrainian governments or other entities operating in \nUkraine, I find it unlikely that any such pressure would cause Applicant to compromise \nU.S. interests. Given that Applicant has continued to disregard his wife\u2019s feelings about \nhis extra-marital relationships with sex workers and the financial resources he pours into \nthem, it is unlikely that he would be swayed to resolve a conflict of interest in her favor, \nlet alone those of her Ukrainian family members. Furthermore, there is no foreign \ninfluence created by the ownership interest Applicant\u2019s wife holds in an apartment in \nUkraine. Applicant does not consider himself to have any interest in the property. Nor \nare he and his wife reliant on the property to maintain their financial position. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions apply: \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of \ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty to obligation to the \nforeign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep ties and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests; \nForeign \nInfluence \nMitigating \nCondition \nAG \n\u00b6 \n8(c): \ncontact \nor \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there \nis little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine \nnature of the foreign business, financial, or property interest is such that \nthey are unlikely to result in conflict and could not be used effectively to \ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \nApplicant\u2019s Intimate Relationships with Foreign National Sex Workers Presents \nan Unacceptable Security Risk and are Disqualifying under the Personal Conduct, \nSexual Behavior, and Foreign Influence Guidelines. \nAn individual\u2019s personal conduct and their sexual behavior, which includes \nconduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written transmission (AG \n\u00b6 12), becomes a security concern when it reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject \nthe individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. Conduct alleged \nunder these guidelines, together or individually, may raise questions about an \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. (See AG \u00b6 12 and AG \u00b6 15). \nSince at least 2009, Applicant has used internet sites to engage in sex acts and \nrelationships with foreign national sex workers. Some of these sites are based in Russia \nand other countries outside of the United States. Applicant believes that the women are \nengaged in sex work and have entered into relationships with him entirely by their own \nchoosing. He believes that the money and gifts he has sent to these women over the \nyears are used solely at their discretion. He also assumes that any information he has \nprovided to these women over the course of their relationships were being held in \nconfidence. However, he cannot know for certain. The existence of these relationships \nand his personal information are a potential source of exploitation. Also of concern is \nthat Applicant seems unaware that these relationships have indicators of human \ntrafficking. (HE VI) Applicant\u2019s financial support could be used in unwitting support of a \ncriminal enterprise. Accordingly, the following disqualifying conditions apply: \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, \nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) Engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing: \n(2) While in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n(3) While in another country, engaging in any that, while legal there, \nis illegal in the United States; \nSexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that\ncauses an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions under the personal conduct or sexual behavior \nguidelines apply. Applicant intends to continue to pursue and cultivate relationships with \ninternet-based sex workers in the future. Neither the personal conduct nor sexual \nbehavior concerns are mitigated by Applicant\u2019s full and candid disclosures to the \nGovernment or his wife. Because these relationships are ongoing and exclusively with \nforeign nationals, the potential for exploitation by a foreign entity remains an issue, \nwhich also raises concerns under the foreign influence guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with foreign national sex workers could create \ncircumstances in which he may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or \notherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest (AG \u00b6 6), \nspecifically: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of \nmethod with a foreign\u2026.friend, or other person who is a citizen of  or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  \nThis case is atypical in that the location of the sex workers, while relevant, is not \nthe primary concern. Applicant has not demonstrated affinity or preference toward any \nparticular foreign country; however, the inherent personal vulnerability in these \nrelationships presents a heightened risk of exploitation from any number of foreign \nentities, governmental and criminal. These relationships are not casual. Applicant\u2019s \nsense of obligation in these relationships is not minimal. His financial investment in \nthese relationships is significant. These relationships are intentional and maintained \nover the objection of his wife. He affirmatively decided to maintain them even after \nconsidering the possibility that doing so raised a security concern and could jeopardize \nhis employment. The conflict of interest raised by these relationships is not just limited \nto Applicant having to choose between his sense of obligation to these women, and his \nrelationships and loyalties to the United States, but also protecting his self-interests and \nthe potentially negative impact on his personal and professional reputation if the extent \nof these relationships were widely known. Accordingly, the foreign influence concerns \nraised by these relationships are not mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept   \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant has been candid with the Government \nabout his relationships with foreign national, internet-based sex workers, it is not \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by these relationships. Despite being \naware of the Government\u2019s concerns since at least 2012, Applicant has decided to \ncontinue to maintain his current relationships and initiate new ones. He intends to \ncontinue paying for sex acts from these women as well as providing them financial \nsupport and gifts outside of their internet platforms. While Applicant is willing to accept \nthe risks associated with these relationships, the Government is not. Accordingly, the \nsecurity concerns in this case must be resolved in favor of protecting the national \ninterest. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Sexual Behavior \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nFormal Findings (Continued) \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on October 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old married man with two pre-teen children. He has a college \ndegree in finance and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. (Tr. 13) He has been \nworking for the same employer, a defense contractor, since 2007. (GE 1 at 16) He has held \na security clearance since 2010. (Tr. 28) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in the community. Per a 2019 \nperformance review, he displays leadership skills daily and has separated himself from his \npeers by tailoring his approach to his audience. (AE D at 2) According to a former \ncoworker, Applicant is a \u201cvalued member of the . . . team and could always be relied upon \nas a voice of reason on complex issues.\u201d (AE G) A neighbor describes him as \u201cextremely \nreliable and a person of great integrity.\u201d (AE H) Since 2017, his bi-annual ratings have been \neither \u201ctop performer,\u201d or \u201cexcellent performer.\u201d (AE B) He has earned several promotions \nduring his career. (Tr. 54; AE C) \nBetween 2009 and 2010, one of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, a friend, left the job to start a \nprivate consulting business. (GE 6) He asked Applicant to provide him with some \nproprietary information, explaining that it would be helpful for his new business. (GE 6) \nApplicant obliged, printing the document with the proprietary information from his corporate \ncomputer system, and giving it to his friend. (Tr. 19) Applicant knew this was against \ncompany policy. (Tr. 34) The proprietary information was unclassified and contained \u201cbasic, \nstatistical information.\u201d (Tr. 19) Applicant did not inform his employer of this lapse until he \ntook a polygraph examination several years later in 2016. (GE 6; Tr. 38) \nIn 2010, Applicant\u2019s job changed from financial analyst to financial planner. For this \nnew assignment, he was moved from an office in a sensitive compartmented information \nfacility (SCIF) to an unclassified office. Applicant needed a monitor for his new office and \nasked an employee in the information technology (IT) office if he could take the monitor he \nhad used in the SCIF with him. (GE 5 at 3) The IT employee told him it was okay. Applicant \nnever checked with anyone from the security office before removing the monitor. (GE 5 at \n3) Applicant then returned to the SCIF and took the monitor, removing the classified label \non it while in the process. (GE 5 at 3) He was never reprimanded for this incident. \nIn early 2015, Applicant inadvertently brought his cell phone into a SCIF. When the \nsecurity violation occurred, he was carrying balloons from an unclassified area to the SCIF \nfor a coworker\u2019s bridal shower and forgot to check in his cell phone before entering. He \nrealized his mistake in about 15 seconds after entering the SCIF, turned around, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplaced the phone in a locker outside the SCIF, as required. (GE 5 at 3; Tr. 23, 44) Hehas \ninadvertently walked into a SCIF with his personal cell phone on four to five occasions over \nthree years. Each time, he has promptly realized his error and stepped back outside to \nplace the cell phone in a locker. (Tr. 49) He does not recall if he ever reported any of these \nincidents to the company facility security officer. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s current supervisor has \nno reservations about his ability to handle classified information. (AE F) \nApplicant has been consuming alcohol, at times to intoxication, since 2009. (Answer \nat 3) His peak years of alcohol consumption were the mid-2010s, when he was drinking \none to three drinks each weeknight, five drinks each day on weekends, and drinking to the \npoint of blacking out two to three times per year. (GE 5 at 4, Tr. 52) \nIn 2009, Applicant was cited for possession of an alcoholic beverage in public. (GE 5 \nat 4) The citation was later dismissed. \nApplicant was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder in 2016, and again, in \n2019. (Tr.54) Neither evaluation concluded that he should abstain from alcohol use entirely. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use has been steadily decreasing since 2016, Now that he is \nmarried, has children, and lives in the suburbs, he is preoccupied after work with taking his \nchildren to extracurricular activities, rather than drinking alcohol. (GE 7; Tr. 56) Sometime \nduring the past four years, Applicant was diagnosed with high blood pressure. (Tr. 59) \nRecognizing the harm that excessive alcohol use can cause for people with high blood \npressure has also compelled Applicant to reduce his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 59) \nBy the time Applicant had met with a licensed alcohol clinician in 2019, he was \ndrinking approximately 15 drinks per week. According to the clinician, this constitutes heavy \ndrinking. (GE 3 at 4) \nApplicant uses alcohol \u201cas a stress coping mechanism.\u201d (Tr. 57) Moreover, he \nacknowledged that alcohol use occasionally has a negative impact on his interpersonal \nrelationships. Since April 2021, he has been working with a clinical therapist to address his \nconcerns about alcohol consumption. (AE A) He continues to consume 15 alcohol drinks \nper week. (Tr. 59) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nUnder this guideline, \u201cdeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information --- which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information --- raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard \nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d (AG \u00b6 33) Applicant\u2019s unauthorized \ntransfer of a document containing proprietary information to a former employee of his \ncompany triggers the application of AG \u00b6 34(a), \u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure of \nprotected information to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to, personal or \nbusiness contacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or conferences.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s removal of classified labeling from a computer monitor, and subsequent use of \nthe monitor in an unclassified area, together with his periodic entry into a SCIF with his \npersonal cell phone, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules \nfor the protection of classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nApplicant inadvertently walked into the SCIF where he worked with his cell phone \napproximately four times in ten years. Each time, he promptly realized his error before \narriving at his desk, and turned around to leave the SCIF to place his cell phone in an \noutside locker. At least one of the episodes happened under unusual circumstances, as his \nhands were full of a bunch of balloons he was bringing into the SCIF for a bridal shower. \nUnder these circumstances, \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 35(a) applies. I resolve subparagraph 1(b) in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConversely, intentionally providing unauthorized proprietary information to an ex-\nemployee of the company is an extraordinarily serious example of mishandling protected \ninformation. In addition, although Applicant\u2019s removal of a classified label from a monitor \nand his transport of the monitor from a SCIF to an unclassified area was not as egregious \nas the former behavior, it is, nonetheless, a serious breach of his responsibility to properly \nhandle classified media because he did so without first obtaining approval from his \ncompany\u2019s security office. \nBoth episodes occurred more than ten years ago. Since then, Applicant has \nreceived good evaluations from his employer, and has steadily received promotions. This \npositive evidence, however, is insufficient to outweigh the nature and seriousness of \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of protected information. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto property protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39) By deliberately \nprinting a document containing protected information from his work computer system and \ngiving the document to a former coworker, Applicant triggered the disqualifying condition \nset forth under. AG \u00b6 40(f), \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not authorized.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nconduct is disqualifying under this guideline for the same reasons that it is disqualifying \nunder the handling of protected information guideline, as discussed above. No mitigating \nconditions apply \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption: \nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant has a history of \noverconsumption of alcohol. In 2019, a therapist diagnosed him with moderate alcohol use \ndisorder. Despite this diagnosis, he continues to drink heavily. Under these circumstances, \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnoses with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nhistory of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program. \nApplicant contends that his changed lifestyle as a father to young children, and his \nconcern about his high blood pressure have resulted in decreased alcohol consumption. \nAlso, he has been working with a therapist. Conversely, he continues to drink 15 drinks per \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nweek, and acknowledges that he drinks alcohol to cope with stress. Consequently, \nalthough his acknowledgment of his drinking problem, his changed lifestyle, and his \nreduced alcohol consumption are sufficient to trigger the partial application of the \naforementioned mitigating conditions, none of them apply entirely because Applicant is still \ndrinking 15 alcohol beverages weekly and continues to drink alcohol as a stress coping \nmechanism. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nalcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s reproducing and sharing of proprietary information for \nan unauthorized individual triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(1), \u201cuntrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary \ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government protected \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct remains a security concern under guideline for the same \nreasons as set forth in the guidelines discussed previously. No mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe possibility of recurrence of the mishandling of protected information is \nexacerbated by Applicant\u2019s drinking problem, as his heavy drinking could make him prone \nto mistakes in judgment. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person \nconcept, I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINT APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 4, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated August 18, 2020, detailing security concerns under the guideline for \nforeign influence (Guideline B). The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on July \n8, 2017. \n1 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on June 14, 2021.

The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s one exhibit (GE) 1 \nand Applicant\u2019s 8 exhibits, (AE) A-H, were entered into evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 3, 2023. The record closed the same \nday. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain relevant facts \nrelated to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The facts are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. The Government\u2019s administrative \nnotice memorandum and source material has been remarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s foreign family members raise foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B. In his June 2021 answer, Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.a, averring that both parents are permanent residents of the United \nStates. He admitted that his brother (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is a citizen and resident of Iran. \nApplicant and his brother have little contact with each other. He admitted that his \nparents-in-law (SOR \u00b61.c) are citizens and residents of Iran, but are in the process of \nobtaining their U.S permanent resident cards so that they can live in the United States. \n(June 2021 answer to SOR) \nApplicant was born in Iran in January 1982. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree \nin software development from an Iranian university. (Tr. 69) Right after college, he was \nrequired to serve in the Iranian navy as an ensign from August 2005 to April 2007, \nworking for 20 months in the human relations department tracking information about \nother conscripts. He never worked in intelligence or combat. While he was in the Iranian \nmilitary, he had no access to Iranian classified information. (GE 1 at 26-27; Tr. 74-75) \nIn January 2008, Applicant moved to an Asian country where he enrolled at a \nuniversity to study the English language. His plan was to obtain a master\u2019s degree and \nthen apply for admission to an American university to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy \n(PhD). During his second year at the Asian university, he won a U.S. permanent \nresident card visa  through a lottery. He filled out the required paperwork and received a \nresident card visa and came to the United States on August 15, 2009. (GE 1 at 8, 17-\n26; Tr. 75-80) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s December 2016 e-QIP, after entering the United \nStates in August 2009, he lived with his uncle, a U.S. citizen, from August 2009 to June \n2010. (GE 1 at 17) From June 2010 to June 2015, he lived at various locations in a \ncertain region of the United States. He rented one apartment from June 2010 to June \n2011, and one from June 2011 to July 2012.

From November 2012 to May 2015, Applicant lived in a dwelling that he \nindicated that he owned. (The address is listed as an apartment.) (GE 1 at 15-17, 20; \nTr. 69) \nDuring the same period between June 2010 and May 2015, Applicant worked in \nseveral jobs before becoming a U.S. citizen and receiving his U.S. passport in January \n2015. In the same month, he also received a master\u2019s degree in cybersecurity. (GE 1 \n18-26; Tr. 75-80) In 2014, he used his Iranian passport for his travel to Iran to marry his \nwife. After becoming a U.S. citizen in January 2015, he returned to Iran for the marital \nceremony using his Iranian passport. (GE 1 at 29-30; Tr. 80) \nFrom June 2015 to September 2016, Applicant lived in the Middle East. For the \nfirst two months he lived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Then, he moved his \nresidence to Turkey until his wife obtained her U.S. permanent resident card visa. \nDuring the period, he worked in the Turkey office of a U.S. property management \ncompany. In September 2016, Applicant returned to the United States and rented an \napartment. Following unemployment for the last three or four months of 2016, he \nworked at several jobs until the end of 2018, when he became a subcontractor in \nsoftware development, and started his own company. (Tr. 70-71) Since his return to the \nUnited States in September 2016, Applicant travelled to Iran every year, using his \nIranian passport, with his last trip to the country occurring in 2019, when he visited his \nsick father. He has not been to Iran since 2019. His Iranian passport has been expired \nfor two years, and he has no plans to renew it. He has always used his U.S. passport \nwhen entering and exiting Turkey, except when traveling to Iran, which required use of \nhis Iranian passport. He held two public trust positions in 2017 and 2022. (GE 1 at 13-\n14; Tr. 68-72, 81-83, 120) \nApparently, after returning to the United States in September 2016, Applicant \nlived at one or two rental locations until 2020 when he purchased an old home for \n$765,000. See, AE F at 4-5, GE 1 at 14. Applicant\u2019s home and other financial interests \nin the United States and Iran will be discussed below under his financial assets in the \ntwo countries. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran. His mother \nis 61 years old. She has never been employed in Iran or the United States. She \nreceived her U.S permanent resident alien card in February 2017, and her state \nidentification card (not a driver\u2019s license) in May 2021. She lives with Applicant. She is \nentitled to no benefits from the Iranian government. Applicant\u2019s father is 75 years old. \nHe operated a construction business while in Iran, but is retired now. He has never had \nany connection to the Iranian government. He was excused from serving in the Iranian \nmilitary because of eye problems. He received his U.S permanent resident card in July \n2020, and his state identification card in May 2021. He lives with Applicant. (GE 1 at 31-\n33; Tr. 84-85; AE D, E) \nApplicant\u2019s parents have a home in Iran. While he does not know the exact \nvalue, he estimated it to be between $200,000 and $500,000.

His \nmother returned to Iran four months ago to be with Applicant\u2019s father who had surgery \nsince medical services are free in the country. When his father is fully recovered, he and \nApplicant\u2019s mother intend to sell the home and return to the United States because they \nhate Iran. They intend to buy property in the United States. (Tr. 93-95, 117) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iran. The brother is 37 \nyears old and single. In his December 2016 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that his brother \nwas self-employed and working from home because he did not have an office for his \nemployment as a used car salesman. The brother was exempt from serving in the \nIranian military because of his defective eyesight. He has never had a connection to the \nIranian government. Applicant\u2019s brother and his parents know Applicant works in \ninformation technology (IT) as a software programmer, but they do not know he works \non behalf of the U.S. Government. (GE 1 at 34; Tr. 89-92) \nTwo years ago, Applicant\u2019s mother petitioned for Applicant\u2019s brother to immigrate \nto the United States. (AE F) A lawyer indicated to Applicant that it would take five or six \nyears for the brother to obtain a permanent resident card. With Applicant\u2019s awareness of \nthe deteriorating situation in Iran, he and his mother ruminated over the possibility of the \nbrother moving to Turkey while he waits for the approval of his U.S. permanent resident \ncard visa. (AE F) Though Applicant loves his brother, he testified the two are not close. \nApplicant claimed that his brother indicated that he wants to immigrate to the United \nStates. (Tr. 89-93, 121) Witness I, Applicant\u2019s first telephone witness, indicated that \nApplicant\u2019s brother does not desire to immigrate to the U.S. (Tr. 18-19) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s December 2016 e-QIP, Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Iran \nand is 29 years old. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Iran and worked as a part-time \ninsurance salesperson. In August 2014, they married in Iran. In 2016, she immigrated to \nthe United States. In February 2020, she became a U.S citizen and received a U.S. \npassport. (GE 1 at 29-30; Tr. 22-26) She is employed as a relationship banker. She is \ncurrently taking courses towards a master\u2019s degree in accounting. Since her \nnaturalization, she used her Iranian passport once in 2020 and once in 2021 to enter \nand exit Iran. With the Iranian passport, she does not need a visa, but with the U.S. \npassport, she needs a visa which costs $80. Applicant\u2019s wife is willing to use her U.S. \npassport in her future travels.

She came to \nthe United States in late 2021 on an immigrant visa and applied for a permanent \nresident card when the visa was about to expire. Her application for a permanent \nresident card is still pending. She has been living with Applicant for close to a year. She \nhas been fingerprinted and is waiting for her interview. See AE G. When she was living \nin Iran, she was a psychologist in the private sector. The mother-in-law has never \nworked for the Iranian government or military.

He has retired from service in the Iranian \nmilitary. Applicant\u2019s wife does not know what position he held. At the wife\u2019s request, her \nfather sent her around $60,000 to cover expenses for the wife\u2019s 12-year-old brother \n(with a visa authorizing him to stay in the United States while enrolled in an academic \ninstitution) and her mother (Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law).

See AE H. Assuming he \ngets the card, he will immigrate to the United States and establish a winery business. \n(Tr. 33-38) \nApplicant\u2019s wife explained that her parents (Applicant\u2019s in-laws) own a large \namount of privately-owned property in Iran. The real property (unalleged) includes a \nhome, office buildings, and land worth over $1,000,000, that Applicant\u2019s in-laws \npurchased during their lifetime.

Before \nher mother immigrated to the United States in late 2021, Applicant\u2019s wife spoke to her \nevery day. When he submitted his e-QIP in December 2016, Applicant indicated that he \nhad weekly contact with his parents, his in-laws, and his brother.

He refinanced an old home, then \ndemolished it, and got a construction loan for $1,400,000 to build a new house in 2022. \n(Tr. 106-108) Applicant indicated that he paid $1,200,000 of the original $1,400,000 \nconstruction loan to the lender. Applicant did not explain how he raised the $1,200,000. \nThe lender covered the original mortgage and paid the construction company for the \nconstruction of the new house. Applicant has about $270,000 left on the construction \nloan. When the construction of the new house is complete, Applicant will owe \n$1,440,000 (principal), which he will begin paying in March or April 2023. He is paying \non the interest currently. Before construction began on the house, the initial appraisal \nwas anticipated to be $1,800,000 to $1,900,000 when construction of the house is \ncompleted. (Tr. 108-109) Based on the fact that Applicant will not begin paying on the \nprincipal of the mortgage until March or April 2023, it is fair to infer that Applicant has \nvery little equity in the new house. \nApplicant owns two vehicles. One is fully paid, and he owes $72,000 on his \nwife\u2019s car. Applicant and his wife have a common bank account where he and she \ndeposit their salary. They transfer small amounts to personal accounts for personal \nobligations. The common account only has a $13,000 balance due to the large \nexpenditure he made to the construction company for the new house. Applicant \ngenerally carries $20,000 to $30,000 in the common account on a monthly basis. \nApplicant has two credit cards, and his wife has three or four credit cards. He has about \n$4,000 in stock and his wife has a small 401(k) account. (Tr. 99) Applicant also recalled \nwithdrawing $38,000 from and income retirement account to pay for the construction of \nhis house. (Tr. 110-114) \nSince Applicant became a subcontractor in late 2018, his salary has averaged \naround $220,000 a year. His wife\u2019s salary is between $70,000 and $80,000 a year.

Witness J recommends Applicant for a \nposition of trust or a security clearance. (Tr. 57-66) \nApplicant submitted three-character references who provided favorable \ninformation regarding his personal and professional reputation. References A and B, \nwho have known Applicant since 2010, recommend him for a security clearance, \nbecause he has never given them a reason to doubt his undivided loyalty for the United \nStates. Reference C, who has had a security clearance since 2007, and has worked \nwith Applicant from 2018 to September 2022, is aware of Applicant\u2019s reputation for \nreliability and problem-solving. He also recommends Applicant for a security clearance. \n(AE A, B, C) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Islamic Republic of Iran \nIran is an authoritarian republic with a Shia Islamic political system. The \nsupreme leader has constitutional authority over all branches of government, including \nthe judiciary, media, and other pivotal institutions. Iran has been designated as a state \nsponsor of terrorism since 1984, and continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism, \nsupplying financial assistance, advanced weaponry and methods, and multileveled \nsupport to extremist groups throughout the Middle East. \nAs of November 2021, the U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iran \nwas at level 4, indicating not to travel to the country because of the risk of kidnapping \nand arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens, specifically dual-national Iranian Americans, on \ncharges of espionage and threatening the national security of the country. The U.S. \ngovernment does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic republic of \nIran and is unable to offer emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran. \nIran\u2019s aggressive cyber operations pose an ongoing danger to the security of \nU.S. and allied networks. Iran has demonstrated a willingness to conduct cyber attacks \non infrastructure. In November 2020, the United States government seized 27 domain \nnames that Iran\u2019s Islamic revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) illegally used to advance \ntheir covert influence campaign. In December 2020, Iranian operatives disseminated \nmisinformation during the campaign to destabilize confidence in the U.S. election \nprocess.   \nIranian government officials contributed to human rights abuses against \nIranians as well as Syrians, by supporting the president of Syria, Hizballah forces in \nIraq, and the Houti rebels in Yemen. As of 2020 and 2021, human rights abuses \ncontinue to occur within Iran. These abuses are exemplified by include arbitrary killings, \nincluding killings by government agents, executions for offenses that do not satisfy the \ninternational standard of serious crimes, and without fair trials; forced disappearance \nand torture by government agents, demeaning treatment, or punishment by the \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment; harsh prison conditions, serious flaws with the independence of the \njudiciary, and specifically the revolutionary courts.

The government has taken negligible steps \nto investigate, prosecute, and punish those government officials who committed human \nrights abuses, because the conduct is considered an unofficial part of government \npolicy. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. However, \nhaving close contacts with only one foreign family member could be sufficient to raise a \nheightened risk under the foreign influence guideline. As set forth under AG \u00b6 7(a), the \ncontacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation or \ninfluence. As the guideline indicates, the country in question must be considered. The \nrisk of duress or coercion is much greater when the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment or where the foreign government has a practice of conducting intelligence \noperations against the United States. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections to family \nmembers are only disqualifying if they create a potential conflict of interest between an \napplicant\u2019s security duties and his desire to assist his foreign family member(s). \nAG \u00b6 7(e) is also potentially disqualifying conditions because of the heightened \nrisk of foreign influence associated with Applicant\u2019s wife (a U.S. citizen naturalized in \nFebruary 2020) living with Applicant and her affinity to her parents who are Iranian \ncitizens. AG \u00b6 7(f) may be potentially disqualifying because of the heightened risk \nassociated with the Iranian property interests over $1,000,000 of Applicant\u2019s in-laws, \nand Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s Iranian house valued at between $200,000 and $500,000. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has an authoritarian government. It has been \ndesignated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. The country performs aggressive \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncyber operations which pose constant danger to the security of the U.S and allied \ncomputer networks. The country has a distressing human rights record. \nThere are three allegations under the foreign influence guideline. Even though \nApplicant\u2019s parents have permanent residence cards allowing them to remain in the \nUnited States, they are still Iranian citizens. At the time of hearing, they were both \nlocated in Iran for about three months while Applicant\u2019s father recovered from surgery. \nPrior to his surgery, Applicant\u2019s parents were living in Iran at least part of the year. \nApplicant\u2019s brother is an Iranian citizen even though he has a pending application for \nU.S. permanent residency. Witness I provided contradictory testimony regarding the \nbrother\u2019s intentions of immigrating to the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \nbeen living with Applicant in the United states on a tourist visa for close to a year, \nawaiting a decision on her permanent residence application. Both Applicant\u2019s in-laws \nare still Iranian citizens. With several of Applicant\u2019s foreign family members in Iran, \ngovernment officials or other types of government operatives could employ pressure or \ncoercion on Applicant through those family members to make him compromise \nclassified information or violate security regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) are \napplicable to the circumstances of his case. Applicant has a \u201cvery heavy burden of \npersuasion to demonstrate that his family members do not present a security risk. See \nISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and  \n(f) the value of or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members have no connection to the Iranian \ngovernment. His father-in-law is retired from the Iranian military. Neither Applicant\u2019s \nfather nor his brother was required to serve in the Iranian military because of eye \nproblems. Even though Applicant\u2019s wife is a U.S citizen, she is still very close to her \nparents. She received about $60,000 from Applicant\u2019s father-in-law to cover the \nexpenses of her mother and her 12-year-old brother. Based on the nature of the Iranian \ngovernment, its appalling human rights record, and its animosity toward the United \nStates, AG \u00b6 8(a) cannot be fully applied because Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence that shows there is little likelihood his contacts with his foreign family members \ncould create a heightened risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies only in part. The essential factor of the condition is the \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties to the United States.\u201d Applicant has \nestablished some favorable connections to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen \nand graduated from a notable American university in 2015. He qualified for public trust \nclearances in 2017 and 2022. While the testimony of Witnesses I and J provided \nfavorable evaluations of his job performance and loyalty for the United States between \n2018 and 2022, their working relationships were relatively short. I reach the same \nconclusion regarding Reference C because of his short working relationship with \nApplicant. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption under AG \u00b6 8(c) that ties of affection to an \nimmediate foreign family member are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 1, 2002) There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of \naffection to immediate family members of his wife. See ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2013) Judging the evidence in its totality, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nparents, brother, and in-laws are neither casual nor infrequent. While Applicant\u2019s \nparents have permanent residence cards, they live in Iran part of the year, \nnotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s characterization about their negative feelings for the \ncountry. Neither his mother nor father-in-law have received permanent residence cards, \nand his father-in-law is still living in Iran. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is established. Considering all the evidence regarding the Iranian \nproperty interests valued at over $1,000,000 owned by Applicant\u2019s in-laws, and \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s Iranian home, there is a possibility that Applicant or his wife may \ninherit the Iranian property. There is also a possibility that neither he nor his wife may \ninherit the property because they predecease their parents, or are disinherited by their \nparents, or are barred by the country\u2019s inheritance laws. The DOHA Appeal Board has \naddressed this issue and held that an applicant does not have a financial stake in a \ncountry simply because he or she may inherit real or personal property in the future \nfrom their parents.

However, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion in prevailing over \nIran\u2019s antagonistic relationship with the United States, its reputation for being a state \nsponsor of terrorism, and the heightened risk generated by Applicant\u2019s foreign family \nmembers\u2019 presence in Iran.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, to include state \nand Federal income taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are attributed to a 14-year period, 2002~2016, of \nunemployment or underemployment. Thus, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) \nare applicable. He has addressed his delinquent state and Federal income taxes and \nfiled all the required tax returns. Thus, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable. He \nhas also addressed his debts to the remaining two creditors, through the auspices of a \n\u201cCredit Consulting Service,\u201d through payment plans. Thus, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and (d) are applicable. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.

In about \n2010, she found out her husband had been cheating on her and had been for years. In \n2011, he failed timely to file their 2010 income tax returns. (Tr. 20.)

The divorce was finalized in 2012. (Tr. 13-14.) \nIn January 2015, three years after the divorce, Applicant\u2019s job was eliminated. She \nwent from a six figure income to zero. In response, she started her own consulting \nbusiness. But the business only generated about $12,000 per year. So, in 2016, she \nstarted doing hourly work for her former employer earning $12 per hour. She worked her \nway up to nearly what she was earning before her position was eliminated. In July 2016, \nshe was re-hired full time by her former employer. She now earns $123,000 per year.

Applicant believed she filed all those tax returns in 2019, because \nshe was a candidate for a public trust position at that time. That filing was before the SOR \nwas issued in August 2021. She missed her filings, because of the \u201cdifficulties\u201d in her life, \ne.g., \u201cfailed marriage, divorce, and the loss of a job in 2015.\u201d (Tr. 15-18.) AE C contains \nIRS Account Transcripts for 2010-2011, 2013, and 2015-2017. Although those transcripts \ndo not match her recollection of filing dates, they show that her returns for the years in \nquestion were filed in 2012, 2015, and 2017 through 2019, respectively. For three of those \nyears (2015-2017), she established payment plans that she has satisfied. These SOR \nallegations have been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant is indebted to the federal government for unpaid taxes \nof $9,439 for 2016. Applicant believed this indebtedness has been cleared. She set up a \npayment plan in 2019 and made all payments. Those payments and any refunds were \napplied to satisfy this debt. Her payments were $248 per month. (Tr. 24-25.) Her \ntestimony is materially consistent with the record. AE C has the Account Transcript for \n2016. She filed her return in January 2018 and began a payment plan in April 2018. Her \nmonthly payments were, with some variations, $246 per month. She successfully \ncompleted the plan in November 2022. AE G further documents those payments. This \nSOR allegation has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 e: Failure timely to file state income tax returns for 2012 through \n2015. In her Answer, Applicant admitted these returns were not timely filed but they were \nfiled and any amounts due were paid. They were belatedly filed, however, in 2019 due to \nthe \u201cchaos in [her] life.\u201d She does not owe any taxes for 2012 or 2013. (Tr. 26.) AE E are \ncertified copies of her state tax returns for 2012 through 2015. Those returns, however, \nwere filed in 2014, 2015, undated, and 2019, respectively. Those returns show no taxes \ndue for the four years at issue, only modest refunds. These SOR allegations have been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Applicant is indebted to the state for a tax lien against her in \nDecember 2013 for $19,419. In April 2017, Applicant and her employer received a Notice \nof Income Tax Wage Lien for $30,472 from the state. (AE A.) She recalled that the tax \nyears in question were 2001 through 2006, and 2009. There was a tax lien, because her \nex-husband also had a business and, and unbeknownst to her, failed to take out taxes \nfor that business. The lien was \u201crectified with the garnishment [the lien].\u201d AE B is a \ndocument confirming that the tax lien was released on April 23, 2018. All of her state tax \nreturns after 2015 have been filed timely, and there have been no tax debts since then. \n(Tr. 30-34.) AE H is a screen shot of a March 15, 2023 state judgment and lien search \nand shows no current judgments or liens filed against her. This SOR allegation has been \nresolved. \nCurrent finances: Applicant currently makes $123,000 per year. Her net monthly \nremainder is between $400 and $500.

She pays off her credit cards regularly and has no unpaid or unfiled \ntaxes. (Tr. 40-45.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes a condition that raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The \nfollowing is applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s failures timely to file tax returns and pay overdue taxes are established \nby her admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits. AG \u00b619(f) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nEven though Applicant did not know at the time, one of her tax problems began \nlong ago, in 2001, when her husband failed to set aside taxes for his income from a side \nbusiness he had. That continued through 2006 and repeated in 2009. It did not surface, \nhowever, until April 2017, when she learned a tax lien was imposed on her wages, five \nyears after her divorce. She satisfied that lien in 2018. \nUnrelated to this tax issue, Applicant experienced a marital separation, a divorce, \nand a job loss, all between 2005 and 2015. Keeping up with her taxes was just one of \nmany aspects of the chaos in her life. Faced with those adversities, she started a \nconsulting business. When that could not make ends meet, she did hourly work for her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nformer employer. She also set up payment plans with taxing authorities and over time \nfiled her tardy federal and state income tax returns. She fulfilled those payment plans \nConfronting circumstances beyond her control and unlikely to recur, she acted \nresponsibly, put remedial tax plans in place, and adhered to them. All of her tax \nremediation efforts began well before the August 2021 SOR was issued.  Applicant\u2019s tax \ndelinquencies have been mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (g).   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In \norder to resolve the issue in a proactive manner Applicant obtained the services of a \ndebt resolution company (DRC) in approximately May 2017. After retaining the DRC \nApplicant turned over negotiation of the credit card debts to the DRC and began making \nconsistent monthly payments of $1,900 to the DRC. The DRC was successful in \nnegotiating settlement agreements with all of the credit card debt alleged in the SOR. \nBased on these negotiations Applicant paid off the newly agreed amounts through the \nDRC. All the allegations in the SOR relate to the business run by Applicant\u2019s spouse. \n(Answer; Tr1 at 14-16, 26-29, 31, 47, 51-53; TR2 at 7-10, 14-15.) \nThe status of the debts set forth in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a and 1.e. Applicant admitted owing $14,801 to the collection agency in SOR \n1.a. This debt is set forth in Government Exhibit 4 at page 2. The high credit for the \noriginal underlying credit card debt is $17,292. Date of last activity is June 2017. \nEvidence shows that this is the same debt as that alleged in SOR 1.e. This debt \nto a financial institution is set forth in Government Exhibit 6 at page 4. The high credit \nfor this credit card debt is $17,292. Date of last activity is June 2017. \nApplicant Exhibit E is a statement from the DRC concerning payment of the debt \nset forth in SOR 1.a and 1.e through a different collection agency then the one set forth \nin SOR 1.a. In January 2019, the DRC reached a 50% payout of the $17,292 debt. \nRecords from the DRC show the debt was successfully paid off in June 2021. (Applicant \nExhibits A-2 and E.)

He and his wife \ncurrently have no past-due debt, and the company is still in existence and profitable. \n(Government Exhibit 6; TR1 at 25-26, 34; TR2 at 10-14, 21-22.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, \nuntrustworthiness or unreliability. Applicant admitted the factual allegations under this \nguideline. However, he denied having an intent to falsify the questionnaire or the \nsubsequent interview. \nApplicant filled out his e-QIP on July 25, 2018. Section 26 of that questionnaire \nconcerns Applicant\u2019s financial situation. Several subsections ask whether, within seven \nyears of filling out the questionnaire, Applicant had defaulted on a loan; had debts \nturned over to a collection agency; had an account suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled for failing to pay as agreed; or had been 120 days delinquent on debts. A \ndifferent subsection asked whether he was currently 120 days delinquent on his debts. \nApplicant answered all the questions, \u201cNo.\u201d As stated, Applicant had past-due debts, so \nthis was an incorrect answer to a relevant question about his financial situation. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \nApplicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on May 13, 2019. When \nfirst questioned about delinquent debts he demurred. When confronted with the debts \nset forth in Paragraph 1 of the SOR Applicant agreed to their existence. The ROI stated, \n\u201cSubject [Applicant] did not report these [debts] on his security questionnaire, due to the \naccounts being in the process of being resolved.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2 at 6.) \nApplicant subsequently stated in his Answer, \u201cI misunderstood/misinterpreted the \nquestion on Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts \u2013 \nMy understanding was that if I go via a debt relief company then that means that I am \nnot defaulting on my payments and I am agreeing to pay the amount that I owe.\u201d \nIn his testimony, Applicant expanded on these statements.

DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a \npublic trust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the Adjudicative Guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had a history of being unable to fully satisfy all of his debts. The \nevidence raises both trustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe evidence supports application of all of these mitigating conditions in this \ncase. Applicant and his wife opened a franchise business in the HHC industry. On the \nadvice of the head office, they used zero interest credit cards to obtain opening \nfinancing. The franchise did not progress financially as quickly as Applicant and his wife \nanticipated, leaving them with a financial issue in the 2017-2018 timeframe. Instead of \nignoring it, Applicant and his spouse obtained the help of the DRC at a point where the \ndebts either were not yet delinquent or were not in collections. The DRC was successful \nin establishing workable financial plans that Applicant was able to complete to all the \ncreditors\u2019 satisfaction. AG \u00b6\u00b6 (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply. Paragraph 1 is found for \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns pertaining to the personal conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified the e-QIP that he \nfilled out on July 25, 208, by not admitting that he had delinquent debts. The allegation \nalso stated that he initially denied existence of the debts during an interview with a \nGovernment investigator. \nI find that Applicant did not intend to falsify his answers on the questionnaire or to \nthe investigator. The evidence is clear that Applicant had a good faith, if erroneous, \nbelief that he did not have to say his debts were delinquent because he had turned \nthem over to the DRC, and they were working with the creditors. In other words, he \nbelieved that the action in hiring the DRC to help him meant that the debts were no \nlonger delinquent since active negotiations were going on. Applicant\u2019s testimony on this \npoint was subject to rigorous cross-examination by Department Counsel. \nBased on my finding that Applicant did not intend to falsify his answers on the \nquestionnaire, or during his interview, none of the disqualifying or general Personal \nConduct guideline concerns apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct. Paragraph 2 is found for \nApplicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility for a trustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person \nconcept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant submitted sufficient \ninformation to show that he has resolved all of the past-due indebtedness that is the \nsubject of the Guideline F allegations in a reasonable manner to the satisfaction of the \ncreditors. He did not deliberately falsify the answers on his questionnaire, or during his \ninterview. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant met his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from \nhis financial issues and alleged personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a public trust position.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms, after being granted \naccess to classified information. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Although drug involvement occurred more than three years \nprior to his hearing, he has not provided a signed statement of intent as to future usage, \nand I can not ignore the fact that his usage was after being granted access to classified \ninformation. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant falsified his March 2018 SF-86. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \nNone of these apply. Applicant did not correct his willful falsification until 16 \nmonths later when he executed his July 2019 SF-86. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected by those who know him in his workplace and in his community. (TR at \npage 15 line 18 to page 25 line 8, and AppXs A, D and G.) However, overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 29, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company since April 2019 as an engineer. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in June 2019. He disclosed three delinquent accounts totaling over $12,000. He also disclosed a civil court action filed against him by a creditor. He also provided information about his student loans. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to five creditors for $63,260, including eight student loan accounts totaling $41,86 . He admits the allegations. (GE 1, 3, 5) Applicant attended a private university in State 1 for his undergraduate studies between August 2010 and May 2015. He financed his education with student loans. After graduating, he began a job with a local company as a contractor. When he accepted employment, the company assured him that they had plenty of work for him. Between May and December 2015, he worked between 35 and 45 hours per week, earning $15 per hour. He was able to support himself, live within his means, and save money. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31, 51) In January 2016, the work stopped. Applicant actively tried to find other work but was unsuccessful. He was underqualified for jobs in his field and told that he was overqualified for other entry level positions outside the engineering field. In April 2016, he accepted a position as a substitute teacher in the local school system. However, it took several months to complete the required administrative process; as a result",

He completed a security clearance \napplication, his first, in June 2019. He disclosed three delinquent accounts totaling over \n$12,000. He also disclosed a civil court action filed against him by a creditor. He also \nprovided information about his student loans. The SOR alleges that Applicant is \nindebted to five creditors for $63,260, including eight student loan accounts totaling \n$41,86 . He admits the allegations. (GE 1, 3, 5) \nApplicant attended a private university in State 1 for his undergraduate studies \nbetween August 2010 and May 2015.

He was able to support himself, live within his means, and save \nmoney. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31, 51) \nIn January 2016, the work stopped. Applicant actively tried to find other work but \nwas unsuccessful. He was underqualified for jobs in his field and told that he was \noverqualified for other entry level positions outside the engineering field. In April 2016, \nhe accepted a position as a substitute teacher in the local school system. However, it \ntook several months to complete the required administrative process; as a result, he \ncould not accept assignments until following school year. Applicant exhausted his \nsavings.

He used the credit \ncard alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($7,955) to pay his expenses. When Applicant began \nsubstitute teaching, he stopped using the credit and adjusted his living expenses to fit \nhis income. However, he did not earn enough money to pay his past due accounts. (Tr. \n31-32, 52-55) \nIn June 2017, Applicant secured a job in the engineering field earning $15 per \nhour. When he left the position in April 2019, he was earning $18 per hour. During the \ntwo years of this employment, he began to rehabilitate his finances, and rebuild his \nsavings. After paying his expenses, he had $484 of disposable income each month. (Tr. \n55-56) \nIn April 2019, Applicant resolved one of the debts he disclosed on his June 2019 \nsecurity clearance application, $3,036 for unpaid rent. He also paid the amount past-\ndue on his car loan, and paid off the car in full in May 2020. The debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($93), 1.b ($97), and 1.c ($226) are for utility bills from State 1. Applicant believes \nhe incurred the debts when he moved and forgot to close the accounts. He resolved the \nthree accounts in November 2022. The creditor charged off the account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l ($7,955) in March 2016. He attempted to negotiate a settlement plan with the \ncreditor to avail. He settled the account for $3,062 in December 2022. (Tr. 29-32, 42-43; \nAE E-H,K) \nApplicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent while he was unemployed. He \nattempted to rehabilitate the loans in July 2018 and thought they had been returned to \ngood standing. He did not learn the loans were delinquent until he received the SOR in \nJune 2020. In June 2021, he contacted the loan servicer to rehabilitate the loans and \nconsolidated the eight loans into one. The loans are currently in administrative \nforbearance under the Covid-19 payment pause. He elected to not make payments \nduring the payment pause so that he could continue to rebuild his savings.

He incurred \nthe debt between January and September 2017. The record supports the application of \nthe following financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt during a nine-month period of unemployment \nand underemployment. He did not engage in financially reckless or irresponsible \nbehavior. Applicant, then a recent college graduate, went from working as a full-time \nengineer to working part-time as a delivery driver for a sandwich shop for a fraction of \nthe pay. Though he could not afford to repay his creditors when he secured a position \nthat provided more income, he stopped using the credit card and adjusted his expenses \nto fit within his means. When he returned to full-time employment in his field, he began \nto address his delinquent accounts, paying past-due rent and returning his car loan to \ncurrent status. He then began addressing the SOR debts, paying off SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c and settling SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nAs for Applicant\u2019s student loans, they are currently in administrative forbearance \nunder the Covid-19 payment pause issued by President Bident in March 2020. The \nloans are now in good standing. Over the course of the payment pause, he has saved \n$6,000 as a cushion. He has also consolidated the loans into one account with one \npayment that he can comfortably afford on his current income. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Applicant\u2019s financial problems were related to a \nlong period of unemployment followed by months of underemployment. He has \ndemonstrated financial rehabilitation. A fair and commonsense assessment of the \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised \nunder the financial considerations guideline are mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n((f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness, delinquent state taxes, and \ndelinquent Federal and state tax filings. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long \nhistory of delinquencies. Applicant attributes them, in part, to his divorce, but that was \nten years ago. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nrespected by those who know him at work. He performs well at his job. (AppX s A and \nB.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

After they were married, Applicant hired an attorney to assist them with immigration services. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s immigration application was initially denied.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non October 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old. He has a high school diploma and he has attended \ntrade school. \nHe is employed with a defense contractor as a Structures Aircraft \nMechanic. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nThe Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s foreign influence could pose a security \nrisk; he has engaged in illegal substance abuse; that he is excessively indebted; and \nthat he falsified his security clearance application. \nApplicant admits each of the \nallegations set forth in the SOR. Applicant began working for his current employer in \nDecember 2019. \nGuideline B- Foreign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Mexico. She crossed the border and came to \nthe United States illegally. Applicant met her at a previous job, where they worked \ntogether. They dated for several years, and were married in 2009, in Las Vegas. After \nthey were married, Applicant hired an attorney to assist them with immigration services. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s immigration application was initially denied. Applicant believes that \nshe was denied because the paperwork indicated that she crossed the border with her \ntwo children in hand, subjecting them to danger. Applicant explained that her two \nchildren crossed the border, in an earlier date, and they did not come with her. They \ncame before she did. Applicant stated that he is still in the process of getting his wife \nlegal status in the U.S. He stated that his wife currently has a work permit that was \ngranted about six months ago. He did not provide a copy of her work permit. She has a \nson and a daughter from a previous relationship, and two children with the Applicant. \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant used the prescription drug Norco, without a prescription, off and on \nfrom about 2007/2008 to at least August 2019. He explained that in 2007/2008, his \nfather was in an accident at work, and Norco was prescribed to him. At some point, \nApplicant suffered back pain and complained to his father about it. His father gave him \nsome Norco, and over time, Applicant became addicted to it. Applicant would obtain the \ndrug from a friend at work. The cost of the drug was $10 per pill. At times he would \nspend $40 a day on the pills. Applicant\u2019s wife noticed that Applicant was spending \nmoney not accounted for. Applicant realized his addiction and in 2016/2017, he entered \nan out-patient drug rehabilitation program. The program lasted one year. Applicant \ncompleted the program and was able to completely abstain from drug use for about 2 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \nand a half years. In 2020, Applicant relapsed and started using Norco again. At that \ntime, Applicant was working for his current employer and he used Norco for about a six-\nmonth period. (Tr. p. 52.) Applicant believes that the loss of his brother in 1999, that he \nnever really addressed, and the stress he experienced at home, caused him to relapse. \nIn 2020, Applicant then entered a second treatment center for his Norco addiction. This \ntime, Applicant\u2019s drug rehabilitation was a ten-day in-patient treatment program. He \ncompleted the program and has been drug free for the past two and a half years.  \nApplicant was terminated from his previous employment for hitting an airplane. \nApplicant underwent a drug test that was positive for Norco, and he admits that he was \nunder the influence of Norco at the time of the accident. Applicant does not believe he \ndisclosed this information to his current employer.  \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nApplicant is indebted to five creditors listed in the SOR, totaling $24,489. He \nadmits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports dated May 24, 2019; March 23, 2020; and August 5, 2022, confirm this \nindebtedness. (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.) The following delinquent debts are of \nsecurity concern: \n1.  A debt is owed to a bank for a credit card account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $5,540.  Applicant has made no payments towards the account.  \nHe recently received court documents regarding the matter.  The debt remains owing. \n2.  A debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the approximate \namount of $413 with a total balance of $4,235.  Applicant stated that he has paid the \ndebt off, however he has not provided documentary evidence to support this.   \n3.  A debt is owed to a creditor for a credit card account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $2,834.  Applicant has made no payments towards the debt.  \nThe debt remains owing.   \n4.  A debt is owed to a creditor for a cellular account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $1,199.    The debt remains owing. \n5.  A debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the approximate \namount of $10,681.  Applicant does not recall the debt and has not looked into it.  It \nappears to be a personal loan opened in 2015.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  The debt \nremains owing. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated May 7, 2019. \nSection 23, asked him, \u201cIn the past seven years have you intentionally engaged in the \nmisuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed for \nyou or someone else?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d (Government Exhibit 1.)

Applicant stated \nthat he was embarrassed about his past drug addiction and did not list it. \nSection 26 of the same application, asked the Applicant, \u201cIn the last seven years, \nhave you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? In the last seven years, \nhave you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to both questions. (Government Exhibit \n1.) Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts discussed above. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n     \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Mexico, who resides with the Applicant. She \nhas a work permit and is in the process of obtaining her legal citizenship in the U.S. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and three of them are applicable in this case. \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these person are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent  that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his spouse, who is a Mexican citizen does not \npresent a heightened risk that could exploit, induce, manipulate, pressure, or coerce the \nApplicant into acting against the interest of the United States. There is very little \ninformation in the record about Applicant\u2019s spouse or her family. However, it is unlikely \nthat Applicant would be placed in a position to have to choose between the interests of \nthe U.S. and Mexico. He is a U.S. citizen and his wife is trying to become one. Their \nlife and opportunities are here. Under the circumstances, and based on the evidence \npresented, Applicant\u2019s spouse does not pose a heightened security risk for the United \nStates Government. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant\u2019s addiction to Norco \noccurred off and on from 2008 to about 2020. He was terminated from his previous \nemployment for an incident that occurred while he was under the influence of Norco at \nwork. He received drug rehabilitation treatment on two separate occasions for his \naddiction, and has only been drug free, this time, for about two and a half years. His \nactions are not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is excessively indebted totaling more than $24,000. Each of the debts \nlisted in the SOR remain owing. Although he stated that he has paid off one of the \ndebts, he has failed to provide documentary evidence to support this contention. There \nis insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, that he can \nafford his lifestyle, or that he has financial resources available to pay his past-due \nfinancial obligations. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant remains excessively indebted. There is no evidence in the record to \nshow that he has made any attempt to pay his delinquent debts. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that he is in control of his finances or that he can pay his bills. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant has failed to meet his burden. None of the mitigating \nconditions set forth above under Guideline F provide full mitigation. This guideline is \nfound against the Applicant. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.  Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. A security clearance is a privilege and \nnot a right. To be found eligible, it must be clearly consistent with the national interests \nto grant or continue a security clearance. The decision must be made in accordance \nwith the DoD Directive and its guidelines. Applicant deliberately provided false answers \nto questions on his security clearance application in an effort to conceal his history of \nillegal drug use, and delinquent debts from the Government. His character and integrity \nare highly questionable. \nHis personal conduct shows poor judgment, unreliability, \nimmaturity, and untrustworthiness, which makes him ineligible for access to classified \ninformation. The Personal Conduct guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B, H, F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not shown that he is qualified for access to classified information. His \nhistory of substance abuse, his history of financial delinquencies and his recent \nfalsifications on the security clearance application preclude him from security clearance \neligibility. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. The Foreign Influence \nconcern has been mitigated. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, Financial Considerations, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a., through 3.e.  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As his income \nincreased, he focused on supporting his family, including his wife\u2019s education. He \nacknowledged that he had not given sufficient attention to resolving his delinquent student \nloans.

(Answer; Tr. 57, 68) \nHe also submitted evidence that he filed for student loan forgiveness under the Borrower \nProtection Act in June 2022 because the school he attended from 2004 to 2006 was \ndeceptive about the transferability of credits earned, misrepresented job placement rates, \nand did not provide job placement support.

He said the creditor \nwould only discuss the debt over the phone and would not send emails or an itemized \nbill.

After \nreviewing the entire record, I find that his hearing testimony is corroborated by \ndocumentary evidence submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly \nresponded to all questions and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts \nand establishing his financial responsibility. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admission and record evidence including credit reports establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.j and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k to 1.n. Those debts are resolved or being \nresolved, occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s periods of \nunderemployment and unemployment and his spouse\u2019s health problems were largely \nbeyond their control. However, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. The delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.j were incurred because of his lack of attention to his financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established.

He reduced his \nstudent loan balance from $37,095 to $31,114, and has the ability and intent to make \nrequired payments once the COVID pause ends. See ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 2022) (\u201cUnder the CARES Act of March 2020, Federal student loans were \nplaced in forbearance and collection on defaulted student loans was paused.\u201d) \nApplicant has also resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.n. He has \ncommunicated with the creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l but has not been \nprovided an itemized bill for charges that he has contested. He recently attempted to \nresolve the $94 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m but his efforts to locate the current creditor \nand settle the debt have been unsuccessful to date. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputes the amount of the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.l, but he has provided no documented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute, or of actions he has taken to resolve the issue. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record including \nApplicant\u2019s education, work history, and character evidence. He was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. There are clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control. His income has significantly increased, and he \nunderstands the security implications of delinquent debt. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).

(GE 1; Tr. 55-58, 79) \nThe SOR alleges 29 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $85,000. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.cc). In Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted all SOR allegations \nwith explanation. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his purchase of a retail business \nfranchise in 2016 and that business\u2019 failure in early 2017. (Answer; GE 1 at 35, 38; Tr. \n31-34, 65-67; AE I) He used unsecured personal credit to finance the purchase of the \nbusiness, including credit card balance transfers of about $59,500. (Answer; GE 1 at 35, \n38; Tr. 31-34, 65-67; AE F, AE G, AE I at 1-7) \nIn his December 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed approximately $20,000 of \ndelinquent credit card debt used to finance his retail business and said that those issues \nwere being resolved. (GE 1 at 35, 38) He testified that after the business failed, he entered \na debt negotiation agreement with a debt consolidation company (DCC1) in January \n2017, to address about $38,000 of unsecured debt, and he made payments in \naccordance with that agreement of $566 monthly for a couple of years. (Tr. 34-35, 62; AE \nA) He reported that after DCC1 stopped operating in his state, he resolved some debts \nhimself, and worked with a credit repair company to remove some accounts from his \ncredit report.

(Tr. 34-38, 62, 69, 76-77, 85-86; AE C at 4-7) As of March 6, 2023, \n15 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f-1h, 1.j-1.n, 1.q, 1.t, 1.v, 1.w) were subject to that \nprogram. (AE C at 4-7) As of March 6, 2023, twelve SOR accounts were \u201cenrolled . . . \n\u201c0%\u201d, one account was \u201cenrolled . . . .100%\u201d, one account offer was being \u201creworked,\u201d \nand one account was paid in full. (AE C at 4; Tr. 70, 74)   \nAs of March 6, 2023, Applicant\u2019s \u201cTotal Deposits\u201d under the program with DCC2 \nwere about $11,060, and he was scheduled to make deposits of $426.50 on March 10, \nMarch 26, and April 10, 2023. (AE C at 1-2; Tr. 70) He said that he paid $840 monthly \nunder the terms of his 60-month program with DCC2. (Tr. 37-38) He submitted an \nagreement dated March 11, 2022, which authorized deposits into an account to pay \nDCC2 and debts enrolled in the program. (AE B; Tr. 27, 85) That agreement reflects a \nrecurring deposit of $840 but does not specify when payments began or were to begin, \nor the periodicity of those payments. (AE B at 4-5; Tr. 79-81) \nWhen Applicant was questioned about the discrepancies between his total \ndeposits under the program and his claimed monthly payments to DCC2, he \nacknowledged the importance of providing documentary evidence of his actual payments. \nI find that Applicant has not made payments of $840 per month since entering an \nagreement with DCC2 in March 2021. It is unclear from the evidence whether he failed to \nmake some required payments or whether the required monthly payments were \nsomething other than $840 prior to March 2022. (Tr. at 77-79; AE B-C) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit card collection account for $10,649. Applicant admitted the \nallegation.

(Tr. 40, 77-78) Applicant submitted \nevidence that the creditor agreed to settle the debt then totaling $7,076 for $5,566 in \nSeptember 2022. The terms of the agreement included monthly payments of $253 from \nSeptember 9, 2022, to May 28, 2024.

(Tr. 57) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 29 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $85,000. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when he used personal credit to finance the \npurchase of a small business franchise in 2016 and that business failed within a year. He \nentered a debt negotiation agreement with DCC1 in 2017 that addressed about $38,000 \nof debt and claimed that he made payments for a couple of years. He said that after DCC1 \nstopped operating in his state, he resolved some debts himself, and worked with a credit \nrepair company to remove some accounts from his credit report. Although informed of the \nimportance of submitting documentary evidence of payments to DCC1 or his creditors, \nand of an agreement with or actions by a credit repair company, he did not do so. \nApplicant entered an agreement with DCC2 in March 2021 and submitted evidence \nthat DCC2 resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.g, totaling $6,672 in April 2021 \nand August 2021, respectively. In September 2022, DCC2 negotiated a settlement with \nthe creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and his payments reduced the past-due balance of that \ndebt from $10,649 to $7,087, as of March 19, 2023. He also paid the $201 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.bb on or before April 1, 2022. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.n and 1.bb for Applicant. \nFrom March 2021 to March 6, 2023, Appellant deposited about $11,060 for DCC2 \nto apply towards 15 delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, including the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.n. When questioned about discrepancies between his total \ndeposits under the program and his claimed monthly payments of $840 to DCC2, \nApplicant acknowledged the importance of providing documentary evidence of his actual \npayments, but the evidence he submitted did not clarify whether he failed to make some \nrequired payments or whether his required monthly payments were something other than \nthe $840 he claimed prior to March 2022. (AE B; Tr. 27, 85) He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence of any agreement with or of payments made to creditors listed in \nhis agreement with DCC2 for the 12 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j-1.m, \n1.q, 1.t, 1.v, and 1.w. \nApplicant submitted undated extracts from credit reports that he claimed were from \nApril 2023 that did not reflect delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. However, evidence \nthat some debts have dropped off recent credit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citation omitted). \nThe absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or \nmitigate a history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform or \nrehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). The evidence \nis insufficient to establish that he has contacted the creditors, paid, or otherwise resolved \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.i, 1.o-1.p, 1.r-1.s, 1.u, 1x-1.aa, and 1.cc. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Although Applicant\u2019s behavior that resulted in \nhis financial problems happened long ago and is unlikely to recur, the delinquent debts \nare long-standing, ongoing, and cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.

Applicant denied receiving financial \ncounseling and did not assert a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of any \ndelinquent debt alleged in the SOR or provide documented proof of his actions to resolve \nany disputes. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.bb.  He \nentered an agreement with DCC2 to address 15 SOR debts. From March 2021 to March \n6, 2023, he deposited $11,059 that DCC2 used to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.n, and to make payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, the timing \nof his actions, limited evidence regarding the details of that agreement including \npayments due, and discrepancies between his claimed payments and documented \npayments made, are insufficient to fully establish that he has adhered to a good faith effort \nto resolve the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j-1.m, 1.q, 1.t, 1.v, \nand 1.w.

Sep. 21, 2009). Waiting to pay legitimate debts until forced to do so by the \nsecurity clearance process does not constitute good-faith debt resolution. See ISCR Case \nNo. 10-05909 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). \nAdditionally, Appellant provided insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that \nhe has initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his creditors, or otherwise \nresolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.i, 1.o-1.p, 1.r-1.s, 1.u, 1x-1.aa, and 1.cc. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, 1.n, 1.bb: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f, 1.h-1.m \n1.o-1.aa, 1.cc: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has three children, ages 19, 11, and 3. (Tr. 26-\n27) \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he worked for a federal contractor \nfrom November 2010 to January 2012. He was laid off when his employer\u2019s contract was \ncancelled, and he was unemployed from January to May 2012. He worked for a non-\nfederal employer from May 2012 to August 2013.

For tax years 2016 and 2017, his income ranged between \n$65,000 and $75,000. \nBetween March 5, 2013 and August 31, 2014, Applicant fell behind on his child-\nsupport payments. In August 2016, he was court-ordered to begin paying child support of \n$837 per month plus $205 per month toward an arrearage of $6,051.

The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: home mortgage foreclosure in 2016.

He held the rental income \nin a bank account, awaiting a decision on his application for refinancing. (Tr. 41) The \napplication for refinancing was denied. Foreclosure was initiated in 2015, and the house \nwas sold in April 2016.

(GX 6 at 3) \nHe was unable to make the payments when he became unemployed. He submitted no \nevidence of contacts with the lender or efforts to avoid defaulting on the loan. The loan \nwas charged off in October 2014. (Tr. 47-49; GX 5 at 2) Applicant testified that it was \nimpossible to deal with the original lender after it was charged off, because they had no \nrecord of the debt. He submitted no evidence that he disputed the motorcycle debt with \nthe credit-reporting agencies. It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit card charged off for $3,331.

(GX 4 at 2) During an interview \nwith a security investigator in November 2017 and at the hearing, Applicant stated that \nhis education was covered by the GI Bill and that no student loans should have been \nopened. (GX 2 at 10; Tr. 59) I have taken administrative notice that federal student loans \nthat students received to attend the technical college between January 2005 and \nSeptember 2016 were forgiven by the Department of Education because of widespread \nfraud by the technical college. See www.ed.gov/news/press-releases, August 16, 2022. \n(Hearing Exhibit II) All the delinquent federal student loans reflected in the GX 3, the most \nrecent credit report in the record, were initiated in 2007 and 2008, while Applicant was \nattending the technical college. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: delinquent medical debt for $327. This debt is reflected in credit \nreports from April 2020 (GX 3) and September 2019 (GX 4). The debt became delinquent \nin August 2017. Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR, stating it was \nincurred by his twin brother. Applicant\u2019s first name and his brother\u2019s first name are the \nsame except for one letter. (Tr. 62-63) However, at the hearing, he testified that he \nbelieved the debt was paid from his health savings account.

At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he disputed this debt because it was his twin brother\u2019s \ndebt. The debt is reflected in the credit reports from July 2016 (GX 6) and April 2018 (GX \n5), but not in the credit reports from September 2019 (GX 4) and April 2020 (GX 3). The \ndebt is too recent to have aged off the credit reports under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, \nwhich suggests that the dispute was resolved in his favor. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l: two telecommunications accounts with the same\nprovider, placed for collection of $454 and $196.\n \n Applicant denied these debts in his \nanswer to the SOR. He claimed that one of the debts probably belonged to his twin brother \nand the other debt was paid in full. At the hearing, he testified that he did not recognize \nthese debts and could not remember if he disputed them. (Tr. 65) He provided no \ndocumentary evidence that they were resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: medical debt referred for collection of $515. Applicant admitted \nthis debt in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he claimed that he paid it. (Tr. 65) He \nprovided no documentary evidence to support his claim. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: debt placed for collection of $476. Applicant admitted this debt in \nhis answer to the SOR, but he testified at the hearing that he did not recognize it. (Tr. 66) \nHe provided no evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of the \ndebt. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation.

The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered circumstances largely \nbeyond his control, i.e., unemployment, underemployment, two divorces, fraudulent \nstudent loans, and mistaken identity due to having a brother with an almost identical \nname. He acted responsibly regarding the home mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, renting \nthe home while he sought employment in another state and applying for refinancing of \nthe loan. He did not act responsibly regarding the motorcycle loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nHe failed to keep in contact with the lender until the loan was charged off and tracking the \ncollection agencies holding the loan became difficult.

Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). Applicant has not met his burden. Except for his recital of the \nfacts regarding the mortgage loan and the motorcycle loan, he offered vague and \ninconsistent explanations for his financial situation. He does not appear to have a good \ngrasp of his overall financial situation, and I am not confident that he will avoid future \nfinancial pitfalls. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

The case was assigned \nto me on January 26, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline, Applicant allegedly was arrested and charged on multiple \noccasions between July 2004 and March 2018 with criminal violations. Arrests and \ncharges are alleged as follows: in July 2004 for violation of The Controlled Substances, \nDrug, Device, and Cosmetic Act; in December 2011 for operating under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI); in January 2012 for driving on a suspended license, in March 2012 for \nviolating the conditions of release after drinking in violation of the court-order issued in \nrelation to his 2011 charge of operating under the influence of alcohol; in March 2018 \nfor driving and operating under the influence of drugs or liquor (DUI); and in July 2017 \nfor domestic violence assault, obstructing the report of a crime and violation of condition \nof release. The allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations under the \ncited SOR guidelines with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he was charged \nwith possession of a small amount of marijuana. He also claimed to have paid his levied \nfines and complied with all court-ordered probation requirements associated with his \narrests. Applicant claimed, too, in his response to have an installed breathalyzer in his \ncar that he will retain for another four months. And, he claimed that his conduct that led \nto his assault and obstruction charges in 2017 would never result in any recurrent \nincidents on his part. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(items 1-5) Specifically, \nhe was arrested, charged, and convicted of the following offenses: in July 2004 for \nviolation of the Controlled Substances, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act; in December \n2011 operating under the influence of alcohol (DUI); in January 2012 for driving on a \nsuspended license; in March 2012 for violating the conditions of release after drinking in \nviolation of the court-order issued in relation to his 2011 charge of operating under the \ninfluence of alcohol; in March 2018 for driving and operating under the influence of \ndrugs or liquor (DUI); and in July 2017 for domestic violence assault, obstructing the \nreport of a crime and violation of condition of release. \nOne of the incidents covered by the SOR was an alcohol-related one that \nresulted in his arrest in December 2011 for driving under the influence (DUI). Arrest \nrecords confirm that his blood-alcohol content (BAC) registered .22 % prior to his arrest. \n(Items 4-5) \nApplicant was again arrested and charged with DUI in March 2018. (Item 3) The \nreported police account for this incident confirmed that after Applicant had consumed a \nnumber of mixed vodka drinks during a six-hour stay in a local bar, he chose to drive \nhome after turning down an offer from friends to put him up in a local hotel across the \nstreet. (Item 4) Because Applicant refused to blow into a police-offered breathalyzer, his \nBAC percentage for his 2018 incident is not known. (Item 5) \nIn 2017, Applicant was charged with domestic violence assault of his wife with a \nrelated charge of obstructing a report of a crime. (Items 4 and 5) These charges were \ndismissed, in part because Applicant\u2019s wife declined to testify. (Item (item 2) \nRemaining charges covered in the SOR consist of his January 2012 arrest and \ncharge of driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license and his March 2012 charge of \nviolating the conditions of release after drinking in violation of the court-ordered alcohol-\nabstention conditions in relation to his 2011 DUI charge.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

AG \u00b6 30. \nPersonal Conduct \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns arise out of charges of \ndomestic violence assault filed against Applicant in July 2017 that were dismissed \nbefore they could be tested at trial due to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s declination to testify. \nConsidered together, these charges raise security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s \nactions reflect a pattern of misbehavior incompatible with the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s three DUI offenses (2011-2018) would likely not meet the \ntrack record requirements for denying clearances under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption), if cross-alleged separately under that guideline. Historically, the Appeal \nBoard has generally required a track record of alcohol-related incidents of more recent \noccurrence than the dated 2011 and 2012 incidents in this record. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0731 at 3 (Sept. 1996); ISCR Case No. 94-1081 at 5 (August 1995). Applicant\u2019s \n2011 and 2012 DUI incidents have not been cross-alleged under Guideline G, and for \ngood reason. \nBased on the evidence produced at hearing, one of the DCs covered by the \ncriminal conduct guideline is applicable to the developed facts in evidence. DC \u00b6 31(a), \n\u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a \nnational security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are the same criminally-related incidents \ninvolving Applicant. DC \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations . .  .,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation, as well. \nApplicant\u2019s series of criminal incidents (mostly alcohol-related) and single \ndomestic violence assault incident reflect multiple lapses of Applicant judgment and \nmaturity on his part. When considered together in this context, the six SOR-covered \nincidents support a troubling pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and \nunreliability, properly alleged and pursued under both Guideline J and Guideline E. \nIn the past, the Appeal Board has addressed multiple criminal offenses stitched \ntogether to \nraise \nsecurity \nconcerns \nover an \napplicant\u2019s \noverall \njudgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. In ISCR Case No. 03-08475 at 5-8 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, \n2007), the applicant accumulated seven traffic-related offenses and one DUI offense. \nSimilar to the array of offenses cited in this case, the traffic-related offenses considered \nin ISCR Case No. 03-08475 were comprised of speeding, license plate offenses, \ndisobeying road sign, driving with a suspended license, and a DUI.

Other Appeal Board \ncases involving multiple traffic-related offenses also sustained clearance denials for \nreasons of demonstrated lack of overall judgment sufficient to raise security concerns \nover the applicant\u2019s cited inability to follow rules and regulations over a prolonged period \nof years. See ISCR Case No. 11-14899 at 1-3 (App. Bd. April 15, 2015; ISCR Case No. \n10-0928 at 4 (App. Bd. March 5, 2012) \nAdding to raised security concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment lapses over the \ncourse of many years are the charged domestic violence assault charge filed against \nhim in July 2017 based on lodged formal complaints from his wife. While the charges \nwere dismissed based on his wife\u2019s declination to testify, Applicant\u2019s reported actions \nreflect still another incident of poor judgment on Applicant\u2019s part. \nWithout more time and demonstrated lessons learned from his lengthy history of \ncriminally-related incidents, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines J and E are available to Applicant at this time. More documented efforts by \nApplicant to adhere to a demonstrated track record of compliance with rules and \nregulations are needed to meet established criteria of eligibility to hold a security \nclearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of criminally-related offenses over a considerable \nperiod of years (2004-2018), when taken together contextually reflect collective \njudgment lapses incompatible with his holding a security clearance. While Applicant is \nentitled to credit for his civilian contributions to the defense industry, his contributions \nare not enough at this time to overcome his pattern history of criminally-related drug, \ntraffic, alcohol-related offenses, along with his more recent domestic violence-related \nincident, covered by both the criminal and personal conduct guidelines. \nSummarized, more time is needed for Applicant to demonstrate his \nunderstanding and commitment to adhering to the rules and regulations placed in force \nby his state\u2019s domestic criminal and civil laws covering domestic partners. Applicant\u2019s \ncollective actions to date fall short of what is required to carry his persuasive burden of \ndemonstrating he meets the minimum eligibility criteria for gaining access to classified \nand sensitive information. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked for his current employer since about July 2016. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979. He took some graduate courses but did not earn a graduate degree. He was married from 1983 until a divorce in 2004. He remarried in 2008. He has six adult children and four adult stepchildren. (Tr. 30-32; GE 1-2) In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had not timely filed his federal and state income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018 tax years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant denied the SOR allegations, as he claimed that he had since filed all of the relevant income tax returns. (SOR; Answer) Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018 tax years despite being required to do so. Beginning in December 2019 and ending in November 2022, he intermittently filed these delinquent federal income tax returns, until he filed them all. He claimed that he filed some of his delinquent federal income tax returns earlier than the date indicated on his IRS account transcripts. However, he did not file any of the relevant federal income tax returns until about nine months after his May 2019 security interview. He acknowledged that his desire to earn a security clearance motivated him to file his outstanding federal and state income tax returns.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 10, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 70-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked \nfor his current employer since about July 2016. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1979. He took some graduate courses but did not earn a graduate degree. He was \nmarried from 1983 until a divorce in 2004. He remarried in 2008. He has six adult \nchildren and four adult stepchildren. (Tr. 30-32; GE 1-2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had not timely filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018 tax years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant denied the SOR allegations, as he claimed that he \nhad since filed all of the relevant income tax returns. (SOR; Answer) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2012 through \n2018 tax years despite being required to do so. Beginning in December 2019 and \nending in November 2022, he intermittently filed these delinquent federal income tax \nreturns, until he filed them all. He claimed that he filed some of his delinquent federal \nincome tax returns earlier than the date indicated on his IRS account transcripts. \nHowever, he did not file any of the relevant federal income tax returns until about nine \nmonths after his May 2019 security interview. He acknowledged that his desire to earn a \nsecurity clearance motivated him to file his outstanding federal and state income tax \nreturns. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38, 43, 54; Answer; GE 1-4; AE E, L-O, R, S, U, W, X). \nApplicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for the 2019 and 2021 tax \nyears. He filed his 2020 federal income tax return in August 2022, after it was due. \nApplicant owed approximately $31,238 in delinquent taxes for the 2012 tax year. He \nscheduled a payment with the IRS of $12,500 on his 2012 federal tax delinquency for \nearly December 2022. He borrowed the money to make this payment from his \nemployment savings plan. He owed about $27,323 and $39,867 in delinquent federal \ntaxes for the 2013 and 2015 tax years, respectively. He is owed a refund of about \n$4,309 from the IRS for the 2014 tax year. He owed about $10,102 and $1,538 in \ndelinquent federal taxes for the 2020 and 2021 tax years, respectively. He claimed that \nthe tax delinquencies listed on his IRS account transcripts will be reduced when the IRS \ncalculates the effects of several real property sales and offsets from state tax refunds. \nHe provided no documentation from the IRS to corroborate lower tax balances. He did \nnot have a payment arrangement with the IRS. Any adverse information not alleged in \nthe SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s late filing of income tax returns for tax years other than \n2012 through 2018 or delinquent taxes he owed cannot be used for disqualification \npurposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of mitigating conditions \nand for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 44-49; GE 1-2; AE E, G, H, K, O, R, S, W, X) \nApplicant was not required to file state income tax returns with the states in which \nhe was residing for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. He therefore did not fail to timely file \nstate income tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 tax years.

He claimed \nthat he has now filed his state income tax returns for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax \nyears with State A. He provided W2 and 1099 documents from the State A taxation \nauthority to corroborate the 2014 filing. He provided W2 and 1099 documents from the \nState A taxation authority, an unsigned copy of a 2015 State A income tax return, and a \nmailing receipt from October 2020 that he claimed is proof that he mailed it. He provided \nW2 and 1099 documents from the State A taxation authority to corroborate the 2016 \nfiling. A May 10, 2020 letter from the State A taxation authority accompanying these \n2014 through 2016 W2 and 1099 documents indicated that State A had not yet received \nhis state income tax returns. Given the corroborating documentation, I find that \nApplicant filed his 2015 State A income tax return in October 2020. Given the lack of \ncorroborating documentation, I am unable to find that he has filed his State A income \ntax returns for the 2014 and 2016 tax years. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; GE 1-4; AE E, \nQ,) \nApplicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns in State B for the 2015 \nthrough 2018 tax years. He claimed that he has since filed his state income tax returns \nwith the State B taxation authority for these tax years, but State B\u2019s taxation authority \nhas no record of the 2015 and 2018 tax year filings. He provided an unsigned copy of a \n2015 State B tax return. He provided no other documentation with respect to his State B \nincome tax filings for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. Given the lack of \ncorroborating documentation, I am unable to find that he has filed his State B income \ntax returns for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; GE 1, 2; \nAE E, I, J, P) \nApplicant provided no documentation to corroborate that he has filed a state \nincome tax return for the 2021 tax year. He provided signed 2020 State A and State B \nincome tax returns from February 2022 corroborating that he filed these returns. He \nprovided no documentation to corroborate that he has filed a state income tax return for \nthe 2019 tax year. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; AE I, J) \nApplicant acknowledged that he owed State A and State B taxes for the 2015 tax \nyear in the combined amount of about $1,300. He has provided no evidence of \npayments towards this tax indebtedness. (GE 1, 2; AE P, Q) \nApplicant\u2019s excuses for not timely filing his federal and state income tax returns \nare many and varied. He has moved several times, which led to him losing records. He \nalso claimed that some of his records might have been stolen because there were \nprowlers who apparently broke into his home. In 2012, he was a self-employed \ncontractor responsible for paying his own taxes. He did not sufficiently pay taxes \nresulting in an unspecified tax burden that he found out about in 2020. He lost a job in \n2014 and changed jobs several times. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2018, as was \nhis wife, in 2020. In 2013, he and his wife spent a significant amount of money opening \na business that failed because of a dispute with their landlord. Applicant\u2019s wife, who was \na trained income tax preparer, thought that she could use this loss as a deduction for \ntax purposes, so they delayed filing their income tax returns. Applicant was working \nhard, and, as his wife had agreed to file the income tax returns, he lost track of them. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen he realized that the income tax returns had not been filed, he was hesitant to \nconfront his wife for fear of upsetting her.

His wife\u2019s growing \nanxiety over these untimely filings contributed to further procrastination. When he \neventually began addressing the taxes himself, the pandemic and IRS backlog slowed \nhis efforts to remedy the situation. (Tr. 38-43, 50-52; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A, D, E) \nApplicant earned approximately $200,000 per year through his salary and \nbonuses. His wife cannot work because of her cancer diagnosis and resulting treatment. \nHe has a few thousand dollars in a savings account and a few thousand dollars in a \nretirement account. He has paid an additional $2,500 per month for an unused \napartment in City A since 2018 that is a significant drain on his resources. He claimed \nthat he has been saving about $300 per month in order to pay down his tax \ndelinquencies once he enters into payment plans with the IRS and the states to which \nhe owes taxes. He has been in regular contact with the IRS and relevant state taxation \nauthorities to resolve his tax deficiencies since no later than November 2021. He does \nnot follow a written budget and has not received financial counseling. Applicant planned \nto set up payment arrangements to resolve his remaining tax delinquencies once he \nand the IRS determine his tax indebtedness. (Tr. 49-53; Answer; GE 2; AE D) \nApplicant provided a periodic and year-end performance review from his \nemployer for 2020. According to these reviews, he is an excellent performer, shows \nleadership skills, acts ethically, and is honest. He also provided a character reference \nletter from an individual who is a long-time security clearance holder that came to know \nApplicant through church. This individual found him to be trustworthy and of high moral \ncharacter. (AE B, C, F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant did not timely file federal income tax \nreturns for seven consecutive years. He did not timely file state income tax returns for \nfive consecutive years, as required. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has now filed his outstanding federal income tax returns, he did \nnot provide sufficient evidence that he has filed all of his outstanding state income tax \nreturns. He owes significant, delinquent federal and state taxes. His financial issues are \nongoing and I am unable to find that they are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant has suffered from issues that are arguably beyond his control, including \nhis and his wife\u2019s cancer diagnoses, loss of employment, a failed business, and his \nwife\u2019s problems in her previous marriage. However, some of the reasons Applicant \nprovided for not timely filing his income tax returns were within his control. For example, \nlosing documents in moves, relying solely on his wife to satisfy tax obligations, and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfocusing too much on work. Regardless, none of these causes can reasonably excuse \nhis failure to comply with his tax filing obligations for seven years. Moreover, Applicant \nacknowledged that he was not adequately monitoring his tax obligations. A degree of \nignorance to one\u2019s financial situation may suggest an indifference to the proper \nsatisfaction of legal obligations that draws into question Applicant\u2019s willingness or \ncapacity to comply with the sometimes complex rules governing the handling and \nsafeguarding of classified information. ISCR Case No. 18-02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, \n2020). Accordingly, the conditions that led to Applicant\u2019s late tax filings were not largely \nbeyond his control. \nApplicant has not provided evidence that he has payment arrangements with the \nIRS or the tax authority for State A or B. He scheduled a $12,500 payment to address \nhis 2012 IRS tax delinquency after he realized his clearance was in jeopardy. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Applicant therefore failed \nto show this payment was a good-faith effort to resolve his debt. \nWhile Applicant has made arrangements with the IRS to file his delinquent \nincome tax returns, and has competed those filings, he has not provided sufficient \nevidence that he filed all of his late state income tax returns. Moreover, he has not \nprovided evidence that he made arrangements with the IRS or state tax authorities to \npay his delinquent federal or state taxes. \nNone of the mitigating factors is fully applicable. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s positive character and work references and I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. She has lived with a cohabitant since 2016. She has no \nchildren. From October 2004 to June 2006, she attended college full time and earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree. She then attended a university full time from 2007 to 2008. She \nattended online college classes from August 2009 to May 2013. She was also attending \na community college taking online classes at the same time from January 2013 to May \n2013. Her college was funded through student loans. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant has been employed by her present employer, a federal contractor, since \nMarch 2019. She was unemployed from January 2015 to July 2015 when the store where \nshe was working closed. She did not disclose any other periods of unemployment from \n2008 to the present. She said she was also underemployed and provided a pay stub to \nshow how much she was earning for a period in 2015. (Items 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant disclosed in her May 2019 security clearance application (SCA) that she \nhad approximately $116,000 in delinquent student loans that were in collection. (Item 2) \nShe stated: \nI had financial hardship that prevented me from paying the student loans or \npay other bills. Once behind, the interest became very high and I could not \nhandle the suggested payments of $1,000 per month. I tried to pay what I \n[could] but was unable to keep them current. I am currently working on \nmaking payments on the existing student loans and working to make a plan \nwith the creditor to pay the charged off ones. (Item 2) \nShe estimated her financial difficulty began in 2015. She further stated: \u201cI have been \nmaking payments to keep my federal student loans current. I am working with the creditor \nto make a payment plan for the student loans that were defaulted and charged off.\u201d (Item \n2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2019. She \nexplained that she stopped attending college classes when her father became ill in 2013 \nand she went home to help her mother. She told the investigator that all of her student \nloans were deferred. Her father was helping her with her student loans and then he \npassed away. She said she was paying $380 a month on her student loans and the \ncreditor wanted to increase her monthly payment to $1,400, which she could not afford. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe said they were all current until July 2015, when she was laid off from work and could \nnot afford to make payments. When she resumed working in October 2015, she said she \nresumed making payments on all of her loans. She told the investigator that she received \na $33,686 settlement offer from the creditor on her private student loans that totaled \n$119,419. She was going to accept the offer, and was working out a payment plan \nbecause she could not pay the entire amount in a lump sum. She was going to begin \npayments in September 2019. The loans alleged in the SOR are for her federal student \nloans. It is unclear if she confused the loans as there are no others reflected in her credit \nreports unless they were removed. \nApplicant then told the investigator that she had consolidated her federal student \nloans and the estimated amount owed was $126,000. She said she was on a payment \nplan and was making $154 monthly payments. She said her father had been helping her \nwith her federal and private student loan payments and when he passed away she could \nnot afford to pay as much. She said she made payments, but they were not likely the \namount the creditors wanted. She did not provide documentary evidence of payments. \n(Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted she owed the delinquent student \nloans in \u00b6 1.a ($60,209), \u00b6 1.b ($53,410) and \u00b6 1.c ($3,527). She said she was unable to \nmake payments when she lost her job in 2015 and after missing several monthly \npayments the debts were charged off. She said she was out of work for almost a year. In \n2016, she found employment, but the monthly payment the creditor wanted was $1,500 \nand she could not afford the amount as her salary was between $15,000 and $25,000. \nShe said she contacted the creditor to make a reasonable payment plan, and it refused. \nThe loans have been sold to different creditors and she is still working on handling these \ndebts. She did not provide specific evidence of what actions she was taking. These \nstudent loans are unresolved. (Item 1) \nApplicant denied she owed the student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,951). She \nprovided proof that this debt was part of a class action lawsuit for unfair lending practices \nand mismanagement and was forgiven. She provided documents that support the debt \nwas forgiven. The debt is resolved. (Item 1) \nApplicant was questioned by the investigator about the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e \n($416). She explained that this was due to an overdraft on a bank account. She was \nnotified that she had 30 days to resolve it, but had to do it in person and she no longer \nlived in the area. She eventually went to the bank, but the account was closed and the \nbank would not let her pay it unless she opened a new account. She told the investigator \nshe was expecting a letter from the bank, but never received one and then forgot about \nthe debt. She told the investigator that she would attempt to contact the creditor again. In \nJune 2022, Applicant satisfied the debt and provided supporting documentation. (Items \n1, 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that she was unaware of the medical debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($279).

She said she paid the balance \nof $236 that was owed at the time. Applicant provided proof that the debt was satisfied in \nJuly 2019. (Items 1, 3) \nApplicant did not provide additional information as to the current state of her \nfinances, how much she earns in annual income, and if she has made any progress on \nestablishing a payment plan to resolve her student loans. She disclosed in her SCA that \nshe has took trips to Mexico and the Bahamas (2013); Dominican Republic (2016); Turks \nand Caicos Islands (2017); France and the United Kingdom (2017); and a cruise to the \nBahamas in July 2019. No other financial information was provided. (Items 2, 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns.

There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these \ndebts. The debt is SOR \u00b6 1.d was forgiven due to a class action lawsuit. AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies to this debt. \nApplicant has approximately $117,000 of delinquent student loans. These \naccounts have been charged off. These debts are ongoing and unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. Her father helped make payments for her prior to 2013 before he passed away. \nShe was unemployed and underemployed throughout the years, which were conditions \nbeyond her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She has been steadily employed since March 2019. \nShe did not provide evidence of any payments she may have made towards these student \nloans, any recent efforts to establish a payment plan with the creditor, or any other \nresponsible actions she may have taken. She did not provide evidence that she has \nparticipated in financial counseling or that there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or under control.

AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

When he retires, Social Security and his \nmilitary disability will be his sources of income. He owns his home and pays a mortgage \nof $2,400 per month.

By the date of GE 5 \n(April 25, 2019), all five student loans (three federal and two for his College) were past \ndue or in collections. By the date of GE 4 (January 8, 2020), all five student loans were in \ncollections. And by GE 3 (May 31, 2022), all five remained in collections. (Tr. 34-37.) The \nthree federal loans have the following Narrative Codes on the most recent credit report: \n\u201cStudent Loan Assigned to Government Collection Account.\u201d (GE 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s two College private loans were originated in 2013 and 2014, which was \nthe period he was working on his associate degree. Those loans funded that degree. (Tr. \n38.) He was asked what led him to believe that the GI Bill covered those loans. \u201cI got a \ncall . . . if I wanted to go to school, the Government would pay for my schooling.\u201d He filled \nout an application and provided information to the school. He could not recall notifying the \nschool in a formal writing that the GI Bill would cover his loans. He remembered: \n\u201c[S]omeone was telling me you\u2019re prior military, they\u2019ll pay for your school. So I filled out \na lot of papers, faxed a lot of papers back, and before you know it, I was in school.\u201d (Tr. \n39.) He could not answer what portion of his service made him eligible for the GI Bill. He \nassumed it was his active duty. He did not remember sending in any military documents \nconfirming he was eligible for the GI Bill. (Tr. 40-41.) \nApplicant first became aware that the GI Bill did not cover his loans or they were \ndelinquent in 2014, 2015, or 2016 when he received a telephone call. He thinks he made \na few payments over the phone. He thought he set up a payment arrangement but could \nnot recall what the monthly payment was. He stopped making payments because he \ncalled the College and \u201cthe school is not there anymore . . . [he] thinks they closed down.\u201d \nHe could not recall to whom he was making payments. He did not stop making payments \nbecause he thought the College was out of business. He stopped because he \u201cdidn\u2019t get \nno more payment or way to make payments.\u201d He still has not. (Tr. 41-44.) \nApplicant was asked about GE 2, his November 21, 2019 Personal Subject \nInterview (PSI). He agreed that in that interview he disagreed with the delinquent \naccounts, because he thought the GI Bill paid for his education. He confirmed that in \nNovember 2019 that is what he thought. He also agreed that he just testified that he \nlearned that in 2015, but he did not know the exact dates. He confirmed that at the time \nhe signed up for his schooling, he was told that the GI Bill would cover all costs. When \n\u201cthey sent me the paperwork to go to school, I was assuming that was from \u2013 that was for \nmy GI Bill or Government paying for my school.\u201d (Tr. 44-45.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant confirmed his usual practice: \u201cWhen I receive a bill \u2013 I make the payment. \nIf I didn\u2019t receive a bill, I didn\u2019t make a payment.

He said: \u201cThe current status is does \na bill still need to be and that I probably need a, I don\u2019t know, a statement, numbers, or \nsomething, or who to send it to to confirm that they receiving this payment or just sending \nit to anybody.\u201d He confirmed that his residence has been the same since 2010, and he \nhas not changed his address since then.

He \u201ccan\u2019t seem to get \nanybody \u2013 to confirm or call me back or \u2013 anything.\u201d He is definitely willing and able to \nsatisfy his financial obligations.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n         Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. The record shows, however, that he has a net monthly remainder that could \nallow a modest payment plan. And he testified that his is willing and able to pay off these \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloans with a plan. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (b) do not apply. But the credit reports do \nshow a history of not defraying these loans. AG \u00b6 19(c) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Of those mitigating conditions, only the following one might apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans originated in 2013 and 2014. Although that is quite \nsome time ago, they remain in default today. And they were not infrequent. I cannot \nfind that AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nAccording to current federal law, Applicant\u2019s federal student loans are not \nsubject to repayment. Therefore, I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. \nThe magnitude of his private student loans and one consumer account ($5,904) \ndoes not raise national security concerns. Therefore, I find for Applicant on SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.f. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The vehicle \nwas repossessed and sold at auction, and Applicant was notified that the deficiency \nbalance was approximately $8,000. (Tr. 52-67) Credit records show the account was \nopened in February 2015, delinquent from August 2019 to January 2020, and charged off \nfor $6,806 with a past-due balance of $8,177.

(Tr. 67-77, 121) He said that \nhe had not communicated well with his creditors, but that he had made some payments, \nperhaps as recently as 2021, and resolved some of the debt. (Tr. 72-73, 79-80, 99-102, \n127) He noted that his federal income tax refund for tax year 2019 was withheld to pay \nhis delinquent student loans. (Tr. 46) In 2021, he was told that he was not eligible for \nadditional student loans. (Tr. 78-79, 102). He said that consolidating his student loans \nand paying them off was \u201con his list of things to do.\u201d (Tr. 102) He testified that prior to the \nhearing, he had engaged in email communications regarding student-loan payment \noptions and his possible eligibility for additional deferments.

(Tr. 95-97) He understood that he was responsible for arrearages on both \nleases but did not believe they would be so much. (Tr. 93-95, 97) He did not communicate \nwith his landlords after vacating the apartments because he did not see the debts on his \ncredit report and hoped they would not be reported. (Tr. 94-95, 97-98) Credit reports from \nAugust 2019 and March 2020 reflect both debts were placed for collection; neither debt \nis reflected in a February 2021 credit report.

(Tr. 98) Credit reports \nreflect the debt was placed for collection and one report states that \u201cconsumer disputes \nthis account information.\u201d (GE 2 at 1, GE 4 at 11) He provided no documentary evidence \nof any payment on this debt or of a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt. \nApplicant testified that he earned $1,500-$2,000 per month while working in retail \nfrom May 2016 until September 2017. (Tr. 42-43) He earned approximately $27,000 per \nyear, when hired by the defense contractor in September 2017, and his gross annual \nsalary has increased to $66,000. (Tr. 38-42, 103) He did not provide a financial budget, \nbut estimated his monthly expenses at approximately $3,000, including his car payment \n($600). (Tr. 103-108) He said that he has less than $1,000 left after monthly expenses. \n(Tr. 108-109) His total bank account balances are approximately $2,000 and he has a \nretirement account but does not know the current balance and has borrowed from the \naccount to pay off some debts. (Tr. 109) He has not sought financial counseling. (Tr. 103) \nApplicant testified that he failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years \n2017, 2020, and 2021. He said that he attempted to electronically file returns for tax years \n2021 and 2022, but that they had been rejected. He also said that he was working with a \ntax preparer and intended to submit all delinquent federal income tax returns.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, ongoing, \nand not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. His delinquent debts \nand behavior cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment were largely beyond his control. However, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not established. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, and he has not provided a reasonable basis for disputing any SOR debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant resolved the $290 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. However, he provided insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that he \nhas initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his creditors, or otherwise resolve \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k, 1.m-1.t, 1.w-1.y, 1.cc, 1.ee, and 1.gg. Applicant provided \nno documentary evidence to support his claims that he contacted some creditors or made \npayments on some delinquent debts alleged in the SOR including his student loans dating \nback to at least 2005. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2021). \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. He is not \nheld to a standard of perfection in his debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \n\u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances \nand develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). Applicant has not met his burden. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education \nand employment history, and that his financial problems were caused, in part, by \ncircumstances beyond his control. However, Applicant has not demonstrated a reliable \nfinancial track record in addressing his delinquent student loans and other delinquent \ndebts. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k, 1.m-1.t, \n1.w-1.y, 1.cc, 1.ee, and 1.gg: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.u, 1.v, 1.z-1.bb,\n 1.dd, 1.ff, and 1.hh:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

She \nsaid that her supervisor had directed her to contract for local computer support for that \nsite because it would be more cost-effective. A recruiter and former general manager \nnoted that her unclear supervisory chain caused problems because she often received \nconflicting directives from different managers.

(AE L)   \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 provides \nthat decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence of five involuntary terminations \nincluding one termination for falsifying her resume establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's\ntime or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing[.] \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (b) are not established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant falsified her resume based upon \nadvice of a person with professional responsibilities for advising her or that she made \nprompt or good-faith efforts to correct that falsification. However, she voluntarily disclosed \nthat she had falsified her resume in 2015 and had been fired for doing so to a background \ninvestigator.   \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) through (e) are established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nApplicant\u2019s termination history and conduct alleged on the SOR occurred from five to 15 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyears ago.

She abstained from using alcohol for more than four years and has \nonly occasionally consumed 1-2 beers at social events since. She successfully completed \ncourses in anger management, parenting and coping skills. She has established an \nexcellent reputation and sound record of performance for her employer and DoD client \nover the past four years. She has taken positive steps to eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. The security concerning behavior is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was well-prepared, sincere, \ncandid, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $59,393 for ten delinquent student loans (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). In response, Applicant admitted each SOR allegation and provided documents in support of his responses. (Answer) On February 8, 2023, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding allegations (SOR 1.k \u2013 1.m) that Applicant was 120 days past due a total of $7,210 for two credit card accounts, and for missed mortgage payments. Appellant admitted all three additional allegations. (Answer 2) The amendment is included in the record as HX 4. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since September 2019. This appears to be his first application for a security 2 clearance. He graduated from college in August 2012 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance. He funded his tuition through the ten federally-guaranteed student loans addressed in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. After graduating, he was first unemployed, then under-employed until August 2013, when he was hired by a federal contractor in State A for whom he worked until May 2015. That position paid about $36,000 annually. He then worked for another federal contractor in State A at a higher salary until he was hired for his current position in State B at an annual salary of about $86,000, an increase of about $10,000 annually from his previous job.

Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine that it \nis clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOn September 22, 2020, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The DCSA CAF issued the SOR pursuant to \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as \namended; and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on May 4, 2021, and asked for a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nI was originally assigned this case on June 9, 2022; however, after being unable contact \nApplicant to schedule a hearing, I returned the case for future reassignment. The case \nwas reassigned to me on January 3, 2023, and I was able to schedule a hearing to be \nheld on February 15, 2023, via video teleconferencing. The parties appeared as \nscheduled, and I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5, as well as a list of \nGovernment exhibits and a copy of a discovery letter dated June 28, 2021, which are \nincluded as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Department Counsel also \nprovided a demonstrative exhibit, which I have included in the record as HX 3. (Tr. 20 \u2013 \n30) \nApplicant testified in his own behalf and submitted documentary evidence \nidentified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A. (Tr. 31 \u2013 32) I held the record open after the \nhearing to receive additional relevant information. Applicant timely submitted four \nadditional exhibits identified as AX B \u2013 E. No objections to admissibility were raised by \neither party and all proffered exhibits were admitted. The record closed on March 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $59,393 for ten \ndelinquent student loans (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). In response, Applicant admitted each SOR \nallegation and provided documents in support of his responses. (Answer) \nOn February 8, 2023, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding \nallegations (SOR 1.k \u2013 1.m) that Applicant was 120 days past due a total of $7,210 for \ntwo credit card accounts, and for missed mortgage payments. Appellant admitted all three \nadditional allegations. (Answer 2) The amendment is included in the record as HX 4.

After graduating, he was first unemployed, then under-employed until \nAugust 2013, when he was hired by a federal contractor in State A for whom he worked \nuntil May 2015.

He then worked for another \nfederal contractor in State A at a higher salary until he was hired for his current position \nin State B at an annual salary of about $86,000, an increase of about $10,000 annually \nfrom his previous job. (Answer; GX 1; Tr. 8, 36 \u2013 37). \nApplicant and his wife have been married since October 2021. She was \nunemployed at the time, but was hired for a teaching position in August 2022 with an \nannual salary of about $56,000. She also used student loans to pay for her college \neducation. (Tr. 36, 60 \u2013 61) \nWhen Applicant graduated in August 2012, he asked to have his student loans \ndeferred because he either had no income or held jobs paying less than $10 hourly. After \nthe deferment ended in January 2014, he was obligated to pay about $700 a month. He \nmade occasional payments, but the loans became delinquent in January 2015, and he \nlast made a required payment in August 2019. (GX 3; Tr. 38 \u2013 42) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant claimed he thought the loans had been \nconsolidated and that his mother was helping repay them. As it turns out, Applicant\u2019s \nmother had obtained other student loans in her own name to help him pay his tuition. \nApplicant further claimed he was not aware of his delinquencies and the adverse effects \nthey had on his credit until his wages were garnished in 2019. Further, he attributed his \ninability to repay his student loans, in part, to the fact his wages were being garnished. In \nMarch 2020, Applicant stopped making any payments because of the student loan relief \nmeasures provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) \nAct enacted by Congress. (Answer; GX 2) \nApplicant did not contact his student loan creditors after his loans became \ndelinquent in 2015 or after his wages were garnished in 2019. With his Answer, he \nprovided information that showed he owed a total of $69,593, and that he had enrolled in \na student loan rehabilitation program on April 29, 2021, just before he responded to the \nSOR. That program called for Applicant to make monthly payments of $327 between May \n2021 and March 2022. As of this hearing, he had made two of those payments in May \n2021. Interest accrual on, and repayment of, qualifying federally guaranteed student loans \nare currently scheduled to resume in September 2023 and October 2023, respectively. \nApplicant insists he will be able to afford those payments and will make them as required. \nHe described his student loans as being in good standing but at a \u201cstandstill\u201d because of \nCOVID relief measures. (Answer; AX B; Tr. 33 \u2013 34) \nApplicant moved from State A to State B in 2019. He and his wife bought a house \nin State B in May 2022.

As of November 2022, he was three months past due and, as alleged \nat SOR 1.m, owed $6,128. On February 2, 2023, around the time he answered the SOR, \nhe paid $4,500 toward that debt. On March 1, 2023, he paid another $3,500 to his \nmortgage debt. Applicant explained that to pay this and his other debts, he withdrew about \n$11,000 from a 401(k) retirement account to apply to his debts. He understands that he \nwill incur an income tax penalty because of his early withdrawals from his retirement \naccount. Additionally, about two weeks before his hearing, he contacted the mortgage \nlender to discuss a repayment plan for the $1,600 arrearage he says he still owes. He did \nnot provide any further information showing he and the lender had established such a \nplan or that he was making his regular mortgage payments. (Answer 2; GX 5; AX A; AX \nE; Tr. 34 \u2013 35, 49 \u2013 50, 52 \u2013 54) \nAfter Applicant bought his house in 2022, he opened the accounts listed in SOR \n1.k and 1.l to buy home improvement materials. The SOR 1.k account is a regular retail \ncredit account at a home improvement store. By February 2023, he was at least 120 days \npast due on that account. After the hearing, Applicant paid off that debt on March 1, 2023. \nHe opened the SOR 1.l account at a flooring store because it included an offer of no \ninterest for 12 to 18 months using the store\u2019s financing. He thought that meant he did not \nhave to make a payment for that period. I held the record open after hearing, in part, to \nallow him to provide information that would support what amounts to a dispute about his \nobligation to pay this debt. After the hearing, he provided documentation of a $969 \npayment on March 1, 2023, towards an account balance of $4,014. The record does not \nreflect any regular payments on this account and it is not clear if his payment was made \nto settle his obligation. (GX 5; AX C; AX D; Tr. 47 \u2013 52) \n \nApplicant asserts that he and his wife live frugally, have tried cutting expenses, \nand use a monthly budget. He provided no written information about their finances, and \nhe has not sought professional financial counseling. Together they earn a gross annual \nincome in excess of $140,000. However, his wife has her own student loans to repay and \nis trying to build up her savings at the same time. For all practical purposes, they are \nsupported by Applicant\u2019s income only. Although their house is titled in both their names, \nonly his name is on the mortgage, and only his income is available to support both of \nthem and to repay his past-due and delinquent debts. They have about $1,000 remaining \neach month after expenses excluding debt payments. (Tr. 58 \u2013 66) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions that pertain to these facts and circumstances: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) do not apply. Applicant has not sought any professional \nfinancial or debt-resolution assistance to address his debts.

He was able to defer the loans after he graduated from college, but \nwhen they came due in January 2014, he was only able to make sporadic payments until \nJanuary 2015, when they became delinquent. He claims he was not aware they were \nconsidered delinquent until August 2019, when his wages were garnished to satisfy the \nloans. However, even then, he did not contact the student loan creditor to try and resolve \nhis arrearages. It was not until April 2021, well after he received the SOR, that he enrolled \nin a student loan rehabilitation program intended to bring his loans current after he made \n11 specified payments. He made two of those payments. Applicant cited the CARES Act \nCOVID relief measures in explaining why he had not made more payments; however, his \nloans already had been delinquent for about five years before those relief measures were \nimplemented. His loans are now current insofar as they are essentially held in abeyance \nuntil the CARES Act relief ends later in 2023. But given Applicant\u2019s lack of attention to \nthose obligations since 2019, I have little confidence that he will meet the requirements \nof the student loan rehabilitation plan and, thereafter, continue to pay the student loans \nlisted in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. \nApplicant appears to have resolved the home improvement store account alleged \nat SOR 1.k; however, he did so only after the hearing. The information he provided about \nhis other commercial debt and his mortgage does not show he has resolved those \nobligations. He did not support any claim of dispute about the SOR 1.l account, and it is \nnot clear from this record that he is paying that debt as required or that it is in good \nstanding. The same can be said about his mortgage at SOR 1.m. Applicant made two \nlarge payments to that account in February and March 2023, but he has not shown that \nhe is making his regular monthly payments as required or that he has reached a resolution \nof that obligation with the lender. The information pertaining to SOR 1.k \u2013 1.m shows that \nhis recent finances are not sound, in that, since May 2022, Applicant has been unable to \nremain current on his newer debts. \nFinally, aside from a period of under-employment about ten years ago, Applicant \ndid not show that any of his delinquent or past-due debts arose from circumstances \nbeyond his control. Based on the foregoing, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant did not act on his student loans for at least three years after his wages were \ngarnished and only then after he received the SOR. Likewise, the payments he has made \nto his more recent debts do not constitute good-faith or show that his finances no longer \nreflect adversely on his judgment and reliability. I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns about his finances. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). The record evidence as a whole leaves unresolved the doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a clearance that have been raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nthose remaining doubts must be resolved against the granting of access to sensitive \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

(Tr. 12, 32, 33, 52; GE 1) Post-hearing evidence indicates he \nreceives a $1,700 monthly benefit from the VA. (AE T) \nApplicant explained that when he was in the Navy, he consulted a psychiatrist \nand was advised to leave the Navy. He left the Navy in 2016. This led to economic \nhardship. He was a full-time student with a growing family, and he had difficulty \nmaintaining employment. He was also in the Navy Reserve. He worked for several \nmonths in 2016 and 2017 for a large retailer while pursuing his degree. He earned an \nassociate degree at a community college and then earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May \n2019. (Tr. 45-46; GE 1, GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances improved when he joined the defense industry in software \ndevelopment. He began with contractor C in May 2019. He had a starting annual salary \nof $105,000, and then increased to $107,000. He remained there until moving to \ncontractor H, his current employer, in October 2020, with a $115,000 starting salary. In \nDecember 2022, his salary increased from $120,000 to $155,000. (Tr. 27-31, 36-37, 42-\n44; GE 1)  \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA that he had been ordered to pay a 12-month \nchild support arrearage of $1,060 a month, which was being taken out of his pay. He \nalso reported some past-due car payments. (GE 1, GE 2) \nThe original SOR alleges $28,742 in delinquent debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) The \ndebts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by credit reports in the record, \nfrom January 2019, January 2020, and April 2022. (Answer; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $24,347 in past-due child support to a \nstate enforcement agency. He testified that when he left the Navy, he was to pay about \n$1,100 a month in child support. He thought his monthly requirement would decrease to \n$1,000 when he left the Navy but initially it did not. A judge later reduced the monthly \namount to $800, but he could not make those payments when he was unemployed. (Tr. \n33-34) \nIt was not until 2019, when Applicant began working in the defense industry that \nhe could make consistent child support payments. Since June 2019, he has paid $860 a \nmonth (of which $60 is payment for arrearages). In December 2019, he attempted to get \npayments reduced in family court because his daughter was no longer in daycare. The \nCOVID shutdown happened a few months later, and he stopped contesting the amount. \nHe recognizes that he is to notify the court of salary increases, as his child support \namount may be affected (up to 25% of his salary), but he has not done this since \nDecember 2020. His ex-wife has also been fully employed since October 2016, he says. \n(Tr. 34, 35, 37-40, 49-52, 66) \nApplicant provided documentation from the state that he made $860 monthly \npayments during 2020, 2021, and 2022.

(AE \nH, AE I, AE U) This account is being resolved. \nThe remaining SOR debts were incurred when Applicant was struggling \nfinancially. He addressed most of them shortly before the hearing.

(Tr. 41-42, 59-60; AE F, AE G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($164) is a medical debt in collection. There is no documentation in the \nrecord showing that it is resolved, but Applicant intends to pay it and can afford to so \nwithout difficulty. (Tr. 60) \nApplicant financed his education with about $20,000 in federal student loans. He \nis aware that they are in forbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but this is \nsoon to end, and when it does, he plans to pay $200 a month towards his loans. (Tr. 45-\n47, 67) This is reflected on his monthly budget. (AE T) \nApplicant acknowledged during his hearing that his federal and state income tax \nreturns remained unfiled for tax years (TY) 2019 and 2020. The SOR was amended to \nreflect this. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) He acknowledged that he did not have a good reason for not \nfiling beyond the COVID pandemic. He said he is disorganized and has procrastinated. \n(Tr. 62-65) \nApplicant filed his 2019 federal and state tax returns (AE R, AE S) and 2020 \nfederal and state returns (AE O, AE Q) after the hearing. He said he was due a refund \nof $3,499 for 2019 (federal and state combined) and owed $81 for 2020 (federal and \nstate combined). (AE H (e-mail of Mar. 20, 2023)) \nApplicant also acknowledged during his hearing that he owed about $3,500 in \npast-due federal income taxes to the IRS, and the SOR was amended to reflect this. \n(Tr. 62, 65) (SOR \u00b6 1.h) This tax debt concerns tax years 2016 and 2021, according to \nhis payment agreement. (AE J) After the hearing, he provided evidence that he is now \non a payment plan with the IRS to address his federal tax debt. He is to pay $140 per \nmonth for the next five years.

They have not done this previously. He \nhas 6% of his pay taken out for a 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 55-56) He said that all of \nhis household accounts are current. He has one credit card. (Tr. 61) \nA post-hearing exhibit details Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses and income. He \nearns $9,567 after taxes. He also receives a $1,700 monthly benefit from the VA. His \nexpenses include his mortgage, car payment, car loan, another loan, a credit card, \nstandard household expenses, as well as $860 in child support, a $140 payment to the \nIRS, $200 for his student loan, and $300 into an emergency fund. His monthly budgeted \nexpenses total about $8,950. He estimates a monthly remainder of $2,313. (AE T) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant incurred several thousand dollars in delinquent child support \nobligations after leaving the Navy, as well as other delinquent debts. During the hearing \nhe acknowledged about $3,500 in past-due federal income tax debt, and two recent \nyears of unfiled federal income tax returns. The above disqualifying conditions are \nsatisfied. \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961).  \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was briefly married between 2011 and 2014. His largest SOR debt is \nseveral thousand dollars in past-due child support for his daughter from this marriage. \nHe had financial issues after he left the Navy in 2016. He was largely unemployed while \npursuing his education. He has been gainfully employed in the defense industry since \nMay 2019, with an excellent income, and a good budget in place. The most recent \ncredit report in the record (from 2022) shows financial stability as does his post-hearing \nbudget. \nApplicant has been making payments regularly on his child support debt since \n2019 or 2020. He pays $860 a month, with $60 for the arrearage. He once owed over \n$24,000 in child support. He now owes about $19,830, according to post-hearing e-\nmails. While it seems from the record that he has not provided the family court with \nupdated information about his income so that his child support obligations can be \nrevised accordingly, he nonetheless has been making payments for several years, in \naccordance with court requirements. His child support arrearage is being resolved. It is \nalso ongoing.  \nApplicant also has only recently entered into a payment plan for his federal \nincome tax debt, of at least $3,500 (as alleged) and likely more (based on five years of \n$140 monthly payments, for $8,400). He filed his 2019 and 2020 federal and state \nreturns but did so only after his hearing. He has not provided sufficient evidence to \nestablish that his debts and tax issues happened so long ago, are so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts mostly resulted in the aftermath of his divorce, as well as his \nleaving the Navy. He was unemployed for a period. To his credit, he used the time he \nwas unemployed wisely, earning an associate degree and then a bachelor\u2019s degree, in \na marketable field. He earns an excellent income. He has a plan in place to resolve his \nchild support arrearage and has been making payments (though it was less responsible \nnot to address his increased income in court, which may lead to increased future \nobligations). His tax issues, however, are more recent, and cannot be attributed to an \noutside circumstance. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant has not yet sought credit counseling or tax assistance. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. He has now filed his two years of past-due federal and state income tax \nreturns (2019 and 2020), and he has a plan in place to address his federal income tax \ndebt. AG \u00b6 20(g) therefore applies, despite the belatedness of his actions. Mitigation \ndoes not rise or fall, however, on application of one mitigating condition. \nApplicant has resolved the smaller debts in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.d) \nand SOR \u00b6 1.e, while unresolved, is not particularly significant. However, the timing of \nthese payments, right before the hearing, is a fact that undercuts mitigation. There is \nalso the matter of Applicant\u2019s tax returns and tax debt. The fact that Applicant took no \naction to address his unfiled tax returns (TY 2019 and 2020) and other years of federal \ntax debt (2016 and 2021) until prompted to do so during his hearing also weighs against \na finding that he has acted in good faith. \nThe fact that Applicant acted only when his clearance was imperiled raises \nquestions about his willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules governing \nclassified information when his personal interests are not at stake. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). I cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d or \u201call\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nAug. 18, 2015) It is not enough to establish that he has taken action. He needs to \nestablish a track record of steady payments towards his tax debt as well as a \ndemonstration of compliance with tax filing requirements in order to demonstrate good \nfaith. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered Applicant\u2019s financial hardships, and the fact that he earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in a marketable field and is putting it to good use in his career. \nApplicant has taken some steps towards financial responsibility, but more of a track \nrecord is needed. This is not to say that Applicant cannot again be a suitable candidate \nfor classified access in the future. What is needed, though, is a demonstrated track \nrecord of payments towards his tax debts and demonstrated compliance with tax filing \nrequirements. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant did not \nmitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \ncontinued access to classified information.

The SF50, indicates that Applicant\u2019s characterization for leaving AGA was \n\u201cresignation.\u201d Applicant testified his attorney indicated that this characterization was \ncorrect. According to his hearing testimony, he started to plan to leave AGA in mid-2013 \nand transition to the private sector; therefore, his 2016 SCA characterization for leaving \nAGA was not inaccurate. However, upon cross-examination he admitted that he did not \napply for a job with Company A until late November 2015, after he knew his job was in \njeopardy.

(AE B; AE E; Tr. 29-30) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to \nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview, completing \nsecurity forms or releases, cooperation with medical or psychological \nevaluation, or polygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following conditions that could raise a security concern and \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to establish that Applicant\u2019s failure to \naccurately disclose the circumstances in which he left AGA in December 2015 was \npurposefully deceptive. It was only after he was confronted multiple times by the \ngovernment investigator during his August 2017 interview that he admitted to any \nderogatory behavior or issues surrounding his AGA employment. Additionally, upon \nquestioning by the AJ, he admitted that he was concerned that if he disclosed his \ntermination, it would affect his ability to obtain a position with Company A and a security \nclearance. His admitted use of a government computer to view pornography and his \nresignation in lieu of termination due to allegations of misconduct are both issues of \npersonal conduct that could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nand affect his professional standing. It is clear from the record evidence that he has not \ndisclosed this behavior to anyone at his current employer, nor did he disclose it to a past \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nprospective employer, due to his ongoing concerns over these repercussions. These facts \nraise significant security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e)(1). \nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant\u2019s misconduct alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was sustained by the MSPB. \nAfter the evidence raised these disqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut or prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 17 provides \nthree conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant reported some of his AGA employment issues in his August 2018 SCA. \nHowever, the record evidence demonstrates that he did this, in part, because of the \ninvestigator\u2019s confrontation during his July 2017 interview. Therefore, this disclosure did \nnot establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). \nCompany B is unaware of Applicant\u2019s past employment issues at AGA, and he \nadmitted that he does not want \u201cto talk too much about it\u201d or give the details away. His \nlack of transparency and honesty with both Company B and Company A (during their \nhiring process) demonstrates he has not taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of a government computer occurred between 2011 and 2012. \nHe testified that the behavior only occurred at home, during non-work hours; however, \nthe record evidence does not fully support these claims. Additionally, although he stopped \non his own volition, he failed to self-report his behavior. Typically, when problematic \nbehavior has not recurred for over ten years, it could be mitigated by the passage of time. \nHowever, Applicant minimized the time-period of his behavior (early to mid-2011 versus \n2011 to 2012) during his November 2018 interview. I also find that he was less than \ntruthful in his response to the DOHA interrogatories and at the hearing regarding his use \nof the government computer to look at pornographic sites ONLY at home and ONLY \nduring non-working hours. During his initial interview in July 2017, he admitted to looking \nat pornographic sites in the workplace during his lunch or other breaks. Due to his ongoing \ndishonesty, the underlying behavior is not mitigated. \n11\n\n \n \n \n Applicant continues to deny the majority of the underlying misconduct that was \nalleged against him in AGA\u2019s ROI and that was the basis for his resignation in lieu of \ntermination. It was clear from the statements made by the complainants and other co-\nworkers that he was inappropriate and frequently discussed within each of the three \ndifferent AGA locations he worked. I considered Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections to the \nROI, including that some individuals who made statements did not have first-hand \nknowledge of his behavior. In considering this evidence, I also considered that multiple \nwomen, in different departments, and in different buildings made the effort to go to their \nsupervisors and make formal complaints against him. These complaints started in 2013 \nand continued until his access was removed in August 2015. His behavior continued \ndespite multiple MFRs and direct orders from two separate supervisors. At the hearing, \nhe continued to fail to accept responsibility for his behavior or truly acknowledge that he \nbehaved inappropriately toward a multitude of female co-workers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough it was not alleged, Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his 2011 security \nviolation in his 2016 SCA is also troubling. Additionally, he minimized the violation during \nhis November 2018 interview when he stated he left a document on his desk that was \ndiscovered by a coworker. In truth, he carried multiple classified documents in his \nbackpack over a five-day period until discovered by security. Additionally, he provided \nvarying reasons as to why he did not work for Company A after he left AGA in December \n2015. His inconsistent statements reflect a lack of truthfulness regarding a seemingly \nminor issue. His failure to be honest regarding the 2011 security violation, his failure to \nsecure employment with Company A, his misuse of his government computer, his failure \nto disclose derogatory employment information in his 2016 SCA, and during his August \n2017 interview is all concerning because it demonstrates that Applicant is untrustworthy \nand has a history of deceptiveness. He has not sufficiently demonstrated good judgment, \nreliability, or reduction of his vulnerability to coercion and manipulation. Mitigation was not \nestablished under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), or 17(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \npertinent guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, including his education and character statements, Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United States to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a & 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant, in part, excepting \n\u201cand sustained by the MSPB\u201d \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Tr. 82-85, 117-126) Any derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not \nbe considered for disqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application \nof mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to  comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This  \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior, and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations[.] \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence support application of \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d). \nI have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling  \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply.

In September 2014, he intentionally deceived his administrative \nofficer about his marital status by declaring that the woman he was then married to was \na former girlfriend. It appears that he first disclosed his misconduct to Naval authorities, \nduring questioning by criminal investigators. He has also admitted that he was dishonest \nbecause he did not want to get in trouble for receiving allowances that he did not believe \nthat he was entitled to after his 1998 divorce. Although he has acknowledged his \nmisconduct, he presented insufficient evidence of other positive steps taken to change \nhis behavior, or that the behavior is unlikely to recur. His conduct continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.

The following is potentially applicable in this case include: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish that he committed, pled \nguilty to and was sentenced by Special Court-Martial for criminal conduct in violation of \nArticles 107 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is fully established. There is mitigating information \nincluding that the criminal behavior alleged occurred more than five years before the SOR \nwas issued, apparent payment of the court-ordered forfeitures and fine, and the absence \nof evidence of criminal activity since his court-martial. However, Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to establish either mitigating condition. His criminal conduct \nwas not a single isolated incident, it occurred over a period of years and casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating \ninformation is insufficient to dispel the criminal conduct security concern. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust, and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish that he deliberately provided \nfalse information to receive unauthorized dependent benefits, failed to file federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, and has a history of financial problems dating \nback to at least 2017, including five delinquent debts totaling at least $37,998.

Applicant has not filed \ndelinquent federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 3.b) or for tax \nyears 2019 through 2021, and has not initiated a good faith effort to resolve, or otherwise \nresolved longstanding, delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c through 3.g).

Applicant\u2019s separation and divorce from his second \nspouse, administrative errors by the Navy with respect to his pay, his friend\u2019s failure to \npay rent, and unemployment were conditions beyond his control. However, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly. He has not filed federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 3.b) or for tax years 2019 through 2021, \nand has made no meaningful effort to resolve his delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c to 3.g). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant testified that he received financial \ncounseling and attended courses in financial management. However, he failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that he received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible \nsource, and has presented insufficient evidence that the financial problems alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g are being resolved, or are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were already \naddressed, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 52 years old, served almost 28 years on active duty \nin the Navy, earned multiple qualifications, awards and decorations, was honorably \ndischarged and retired in 2017. I considered that he is respected by a Navy leader and \nthat the VA determined him to be 80% disabled due to service-connected disabilities. I \nalso considered that he has held a security clearance, including a top secret clearance. \nHowever, he engaged in a pattern of deception regarding his ex-spouse\u2019s eligibility \nfor dependent status and benefits from at least 2006 to September 2014, and was court-\nmartialed for that misconduct in October 2015. He has also failed to file federal income\ntax returns from tax years 2017 through 2021, and has not meaningfully attempted to\nresolve delinquent debts totaling at least $37,998. His pattern of deception and\nsubsequent decision not to file income tax returns or to make payments on or otherwise\nattempt to resolve his delinquent debts raise ongoing and current security concerns under\nthe Directive. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to \nproperly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such \ninformation. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an \napplicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of \npersons handling classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (App. Bd. Apr. \n29, 1999). Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security. Directive, Enclosure 2, App. A \n\u00b6 2(b). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, J \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct, criminal \nconduct, and financial considerations. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a\u20133.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Answer) In addition to the facts established by her \nadmissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She and her husband \nhave been married since June 1997. She holds a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees earned \nin 1994 and 2002, respectively.

SAPFs are usually located within SCIFs. Classified work in those facilities is \nregulated by specific rules regarding access, internal storage of documents, and use of \nelectronic devices, such as cellphones, laptops, and tablets. Although Applicant has held \na security clearance during the entirety of her employment, it was not until September \n2016 that she began working primarily with classified information and in a SCIF fulltime. \nAdditionally, starting in 2015, Applicant\u2019s company experienced a rapid expansion of its \nworkforce for newly awarded classified projects, for which an increased use of SCIFs \nbecame necessary. Applicant was assigned as a manager for both the substantive work \non one of those projects and for hiring and oversight of new personnel in her part of the \norganization. Before 2015, she was responsible for 15 personnel. After 2015, she \neventually was tasked with oversight of between 70 and 140 personnel. This resulted in \na sharp uptick in her workload under often stressful conditions. She was issued a \ncompany cellphone and laptop, and had to travel to other job sites on a regular basis. In \nshort, Applicant became a very busy person. (Answer; Tr. 23 \u2013 25, 26 \u2013 30, 122 \u2013 123) \nAs part of this rapid expansion, and in addition to basic security procedures \nrequired of all persons holding clearances, employees were briefed on security \nrequirements for working in secure spaces. A common subject of those briefings, held at \nleast annually, was the rule against bringing cellphones, both personal and work-issued, \ninto SCIFs. Those secure spaces were located within a larger building for which entry and \nmobility were not as restrictive as for inside the secured areas. Lockers were installed \nnext to the entrance of each SCIF so that employees could secure their cellphones and \nother prohibited devices on the way into those spaces. Because of the ubiquitous nature \nof cellphones in society and the workplace, it appears that violating the cellphone \nprohibition was a common occurrence, so much so that around 2018, the company \nrenovated its workplace to improve the way cellphones were regulated. After the \nrenovation, rather than being able to move about with one\u2019s phone in an unclassified area \nbefore going into a SCIF, employees were required to relinquish unapproved devices as \nsoon as they entered the building. Signage reflecting the rules about cellphones and other \nelectronic devices was made more prominent, and it appears the number of violations \ndecreased significantly. (Answer; Tr. 78 \u2013 80, 125 \u2013 126) \nSOR 1.g: On September 23, 2015, not long after she was assigned as a manager, \nshe attended a meeting in a SCIF with the manager of a team involved in classified work \nto which some of Applicant\u2019s personnel were assigned. She had never been in that SCIF \nbefore. She was still carrying both phones in her purse in violation of rules against taking \nthem into a SCIF. During the meeting, one of her cellphones rang. She silenced the \nphone, secured them both in one of the lockers she had passed on her way into the SCIF, \nand returned to the meeting.

The security office employee who conducted the investigation of this incident \ncounseled Applicant about the need to properly store her cellphones outside of secure \nareas. After this incident, Applicant did not change her routine or the way she handled \nher phones because going to that, or any other SCIF was not yet part of her usual routine. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 25 \u2013 42) \nSOR 1.f: On May 2, 2016, before going to her own office, Applicant went to an \nunclassified part of the building she worked in to begin \u201conboarding\u201d new employees. At \nsome point, she brought some of them to the security office for in-processing. The security \noffice was in a SCIF, so the new employees waited outside while Applicant went in to \nbegin that part of their check-in process. When she entered the SCIF, she had both of \nher cellphones in her hand. A security office employee pointed out the phones to \nApplicant, who said \u201coops.\u201d She then left the space to secure the phones in a locker at \nthe entrance. Having been seen with cellphones in a SCIF by a security staff member, \nshe self-reported the violation, and the matter was dealt with in same manner as her \nSeptember 2015 violation. Again, no classified information was compromised, no \ndiscipline was taken, and Applicant was counseled about the no-cellphone rule by a \nsecurity staff employee. After this incident, Applicant chose to deactivate the voice \nfunctions on her company phone and leave it in her car. The only time she used that \nphone was for monthly travel, so she had no use for it inside her secure workspaces. \nApplicant still carried her personal phone to work to stay in touch with her family as \nneeded, and she resolved to be more vigilant about keeping the phone out of SCIFs. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 42 \u2013 48) \nSOR 1.e and 1.j: At the beginning of her workday on an unspecified date in June \n2016, Applicant walked into the SAPF where her desk was located.

No one \nwitnessed this incident, and she did not report it when it happened as required.

She retrieved her cellphone from the locker in which \nshe had stored it before the meeting. After checking for messages, she put it in her coat \npocket at the same time a co-worker asked to talk with her back in the SCIF for a few \nminutes. He held the door open for her and she entered without first storing her cellphone \nin locker. After a brief discussion, she again left the SCIF and realized she still had the \nphone in her pocket. After going to the restroom, she again secured it in a locker before \nreentering the SCIF to continue the meeting. No one else knew she had the phone in the \nSCIF, and she did not report this event as required. Again, she feared the consequences \nknowing that she had committed multiple cellphone infractions during the prior 18 months. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 52 \u2013 54) \nAfter her January 2017 cellphone incident, Applicant attended a previously \nscheduled security refresher training on January 16, 2017, that reinforced the need to \nself-report any security violations or infractions. After that training, she felt the need to \nclear her conscience about her unreported cellphone infractions in June and July 2016, \nand in January 2017. She reported all three incidents on January 23, 2017. The company \nsecurity office processed each of the three events in the same manner as the September \n2015 and May 2016 incidents. In assessing the failure to self-report each incident, it was \ndetermined that, although each individual event constituted a security infraction, all five \nevents and her failure to report three of them rose to the level of a security violation. The \ninvestigation of that violation included a detailed statement from Applicant and a \ndetermination by the security staff that she was culpable of a security violation. In findings \nissued on January 28, 2017, security personnel also recommended that she thereafter \nbe subject to periodic interviews by the security staff \u201cto ensure that she has reported all \nincidents to the Security office,\u201d and that \u201c[m]anagement will provide a summary of \nselected corrective action(s) to Security within two weeks of receiving this report.\u201d \nAccording to Applicant, no one interviewed her after that report was issued, and there \nwere no corrective actions identified. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 54 \u2013 56) \nApplicant received a letter of reprimand after the January 2017 security office \nreport. The only subsequent corrective action by management consisted of informal \ncounseling by security staff, which included suggesting ways Applicant could change her \ndaily routine to make her more aware of the no-cellphone rule. Applicant herself took \nactions such as wearing rings in a certain way to sensitize her about what might be in her \nhands. She also had her cellphone calls forwarded to her office phone so she could leave \nthe cellphone in her car each day. In December 2016, Applicant asked for a pager that \ncould be taken into secure spaces so her family could contact her without using her \ncellphone; however, Applicant did not receive the pager until after her January 5, 2017, \ninfraction.

She claims the letter, which was \nnot produced at hearing, and which she claims her employer has not produced despite \nher repeated requests, accused her of \u201cunethical\u201d conduct in connection with those \nevents. Applicant takes umbrage with that characterization, which she felt was overly \nharsh under the circumstances.

She did not identify what that training would entail or how \nany deficient security practices by her employer caused her to commit any of her security \ninfractions. The investigative materials that documented security officials\u2019 responses to \nall her cellphone infractions show that she was verbally counseled about the rule against \ncellphones each time, and she stated multiple times that she understood the rules. \n(Answer; GX 3; AX C; Tr. 88 \u2013 94) \nIn a footnote in Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Answer at page 5, fn1), she \nrecounted another instance in which she brought a prohibited device \u2013 her company \ncellphone \u2013 into a secure space. This conduct was not alleged in the SOR, but was further \ndeveloped through her hearing testimony, both on direct and cross-examination. (I am \nonly examining it as part of my assessment of information probative of mitigation.) As \npreviously discussed, after her May 2016 cellphone infraction, Applicant decided to \ndeactivate most of the voice functions in her company cellphone and leave it in her car. \nShe then kept the device in a bag she used when she traveled and in which she would \nalso carry her laptop and other business-related travel needs. In January 2017, after she \nreceived a pager, she had company technicians completely deactivate the phone. The \ncompany then instructed her to send the device to a corporate facility for disposal. In the \nlate summer or early fall of 2019, Applicant and her team were working on a weekend, \nand she decided to treat her team members to bagels and coffee in the SCIF. To carry \nthe food and drink, as well as the usual items she brought to the office every day, she \nretrieved the travel bag from her car. Believing it to be empty, she filled it with the items \nshe needed to carry, then entered the SCIF. When she emptied the bag of its contents in \nthe SCIF, she found the deactivated cellphone. She had forgotten to send the device to \nthe corporate facility as she had been instructed to do. The device itself was not charged \nand appeared to be unusable even if charged. Not long thereafter, she sent the device \nfor disposal. Applicant never reported this incident to the company security staff. She \naverred that she did not report this matter because it would serve no purpose to report \nthat she had brought a useless device into a SCIF. She also was wary of the \nconsequences of reporting her actions after she had been cited for \u201cunethical\u201d conduct in \nher second letter of reprimand a few months earlier. While that letter was not produced \nfor this record, the testimony of her former supervisor confirmed the nature of the letter \nand he response to it. Additionally, Applicant disclosed her receipt of the second letter of \nreprimand in her most recent e-QIP and it was discussed during her July 15, 2019, \npersonal subject interview (PSI).

Applicant\u2019s former supervisor (he is now retired) testified that he knew \nher to be an excellent employee and that he would unreservedly recommend her for a \nposition of trust despite his knowledge of some of her security incidents. Applicant\u2019s \nperformance reviews, letters of recommendation (including from her current supervisor), \nvarious technical qualifications and certifications also reflect positively on her character \nand reliability. (AX A \u2013 C; Tr. 98 \u2013 101, 119 \u2013 123) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nHandling Protected Information \nBetween 2015 and 2019, Applicant committed ten violations of rules intended to \nsafeguard classified information. Information about her conduct in this regard reasonably \nraises a security concern about her willingness or ability to properly safeguard sensitive \ninformation. That security concern is stated at AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nOn five occasions, as alleged in SOR 1.c \u2013 1.g, Applicant brought prohibited\nelectronic devices into secure spaces. After three of those infractions, as alleged in SOR \n1.h \u2013 1.j, she did not report her cellphone incidents as required. Although she may have \nbeen unclear about the no-cellphone rule before May 2015, it was clear to her thereafter. \nNonetheless, she broke that rule at least six more times. To her credit, she self-reported \non the first two occasions and was informally counseled about the no-cellphone rule by \nsecurity staff. However, after the next three incidents, when no one else knew that she \nhad brought her cellphones into the SCIF, and because she feared the consequences \nthat might ensue, Applicant decided to not comply with the requirement to timely self-\nreport her infractions. Her failures to self-report constituted three more violations of \nsecurity regulations, which along with the underlying cellphone infractions, were \ninvestigated collectively as a single security violation for which she was deemed culpable.  \n \nAs alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b, she twice failed to properly secure classified \ninformation as required. Despite the fact her desk was in a SCIF, that space was not \napproved for open storage of classified information when the space was unoccupied. To \nher credit, Applicant self-reported both violations. After the first document-related incident, \nit appears the company took no disciplinary action. After the second document-related \nincident, she was issued a letter of reprimand that addressed both of the events alleged \nin SOR 1.a and 1.b. \nAll of the foregoing information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 34 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nI also have considered the potential application of the following AG \u00b6 35 mitigating \nconditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant\u2019s last reported violation occurred in January 2019. As to her improper \nhandling of documents in 2018 and 2019, they were infrequent, and she is unlikely to \nrepeat those infractions after receiving a second letter of reprimand and since devising a \nchecklist to use at the end of every workday. As to her cellphone violations, the last \ninfraction occurred five years ago, and she is unlikely to repeat them because she uses \nan approved pager instead of a cellphone. Even though she became busy starting in 2015 \nand may not have been sensitive to the no-cellphone rule before her first infraction, they \npersisted despite the fact she was counseled about this simple rule each time she self-\nreported her actions. Although she was aware of the significance of violating this rule, she \ndecided three times to not self-report because of concerns about the consequences that \nmight result. Not only did Applicant decide to not self-report, she also has not told her \nemployer about the cellphone she brought into the SCIF in late summer or early fall of \n2019. She believes doing so would serve no useful purpose and because she, again, was \nconcerned about the consequences. The phone may, indeed, be of no consequence; \nhowever, that is not her determination to make. All of the foregoing undermines any claim \nthat her conduct in this regard \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(a) does not apply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was credible in her assertions that she has a positive attitude towards \nher security responsibilities. Yet her cellphone infractions recurred several times after \nbeing informally counseled in September 2015 and May 2016. Additionally, and despite \nbeing counseled after those incidents, she decided to withhold information about her \nconduct when no one else was aware of it. Her willingness to withhold information about \nher security infractions appears to have extended to her failure to report the unalleged \nfact that she brought a cellphone into a SCIF in 2019. While it is commendable that she \ndisclosed that incident as part of this proceeding, it would have been more consistent with \nher renewed positive approach to security had she reported it to her security staff when \nit occurred more than three years ago. AG \u00b6 35(b) does not apply. \nApplicant at various points in her Answer and her testimony cites a lack of \nefficiency and follow through by her employer in ensuring that she was properly trained \nin proper security procedures. There is information in the record that suggests her \ncompany may not have followed through on recommendations for remedial measures \nafter each infraction or violation. Nonetheless, available information shows that Applicant \nknew that she should not bring her phone into a SCIF and that her SCIF was not approved \nfor open storage of classified documents. In short, it appears she was properly trained in \nthese matters. She also was trained in the requirement to self-report her infractions when \nthey occur, and she did so after two of her four cellphone infractions and both of her \ndocument storage infractions. Despite her awareness of the rules about these matters, \nshe affirmatively decided to stay silent about three of her cellphone infractions. It is difficult \nto see how, given Applicant\u2019s experience since 2015, how more training would have \nhelped her better understand her obligations regarding cellphone rules, document \nstorage, and most important, self-reporting. On balance, AG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply. \nThe infractions alleged at SOR 1.c \u2013 1.g were inadvertent, and no information was \ncompromised. Indeed, the infraction at SOR 1.a may not have been entirely Applicant\u2019s \nfault given the apparent mishandling by her co-worker that resulted in the document \ncoming into Applicant\u2019s possession. Regardless, because she knew the document was \nclassified even if it was not correctly marked, she bears some responsibility for not \nproperly safeguarding it once it was under her control. She timely self-reported the events \naddressed in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. But her decisions to not self-report the cellphone \ninfractions at SOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f as required constitute deliberate and multiple \nviolations. Those decisions also suggest a pattern, in that she did not report violations in \nwhich she was the only one who knew they had occurred. Even though it was not alleged, \nshe again has not reported another possible infraction involving her company cellphone \nin 2019. While acknowledging she again feared what consequences might come of this \ninformation, she also has rationalized her ongoing failure to report that information based \non her own assessment that the device was useless and that it would not matter if she \nreported the incident. That assessment was not hers to make. Her violation of cellphone \nrules and her failure to report them preclude application of AG \u00b6 35(d). \nEach alleged violation or infraction, standing alone, may not be considered a \nsignificant event. However, the record as a whole regarding these events presents a more \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepetitive disregard for security procedures, and it does not support a conclusion that this \nconduct will not recur. On balance, available information shows that Applicant has not \nestablished any of the AG 35 mitigating conditions. The security concerns raised under \nthis guideline by the Government\u2019s information are resolved against the Applicant. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s information that established security concerns under Guideline \nK also supports the cross-allegations of SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j under Guideline E. The security \nconcern about an individual\u2019s personal conduct is expressed in relevant part at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nMore specifically, I have considered the following AG \u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not apply because the information about Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity infractions and violations was addressed under Guideline K and is sufficient for \nan adverse decision. Accordingly, there is no disqualification established under Guideline \nE, which is resolved for Applicant. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). I note Applicant\u2019s record of excellent performance during her career, the \npositive recommendations by her current and former supervisors, and her wealth of \nprofessional accomplishments and qualifications. Additionally, her charitable efforts in the \ncommunity reflect well on her character. However, this positive information is not sufficient \nto overcome the security ramifications of her multiple and, at times, deliberate security \nviolations, and the reasonable security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information \nhave not been mitigated. In addition to the need to abide by rules and procedures for \nsafeguarding classified information, a fundamental tenet of the Government\u2019s industrial \nsecurity program involves a willingness by cleared individuals to report or disclose \nadverse information even at the cost of their own interests. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information imposes a fiduciary obligation that requires individuals to place the \nnational interest in protecting that information ahead of their own interests. Because that \ndid not occur on multiple occasions here, doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability remain. \nProtection of the interests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications. \nAccordingly, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nConclusion \nBased on all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",
