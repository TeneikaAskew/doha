He is 49 years old. The dates of \nhis first marriage and divorce are not in the record. He remarried in 2011 and divorced \nin 2019.

(Answer; Items 3, 5) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state \nincome tax returns for at least tax years (TY) 2013 through 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b). It \nalso alleged that he had seven delinquent consumer debts, totaling $49,689 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c \u2013 1.i). In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant also disclosed and \ndiscussed his delinquent taxes and debts in his SCA, during background interviews \nfrom April 2021 and May 2021, and in his January 2022 response to interrogatories. A \ncredit bureau report from March 2021 reports all of Applicant\u2019s delinquent consumer \ndebts. A motor vehicle registration record reflects the debt for SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Items 1 - 6)  \n \nDuring his April 2021 background interview, Applicant attributed his financial \nissues to being the sole provider for his family and not having enough money to pay his \ndebts. He also stated in his Answer, \u201cMy former wife unbeknownst to me had a \nchemical dependency.\u201d He also stated that she opened various credit accounts in his \nname without his knowledge until he blocked her from being able to do so. (Answer; \nItem 5) \nApplicant listed in his SCA that he failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2015, and that he consequently owed $10,000. He acknowledged during \nhis April 2021 background interview that he failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2013, 2014, and 2015, but he could not provide a reason for his failure. \nHe indicated that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for these tax years in \n2016, and that he owed between $5,000 and $7,000 in federal taxes. He indicated that \nthe IRS withheld his tax refunds to resolve his outstanding taxes. (Items 3, 5) \nApplicant indicated during his April 2021 background interview and in his \nresponse to interrogatories that he did not file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor TY 2017, 2018, and 2019 because he was tax exempt due to his overseas \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployment. He further indicated during his April 2021 background interview that since \nreturning from overseas employment, he did not file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2019 and 2020 because his employer did not provide him with a W-2. He \nindicated that he last filed his federal and state income tax returns in 2016, and he was \nwilling to submit any unfiled federal and state income tax returns if required for his \nemployment or security clearance. He stated in his response to interrogatories that he \nwas unemployed in 2020 and part of 2021. He stated in his Answer that he was in the \nprocess of filing his federal and state income tax returns for 2013 through 2021. He \nstated in his FORM Response that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 to 2021, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims. \nIRS records reflect that as of January 2022, the IRS did not have record of federal \nincome tax returns for Applicant for TY 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (Answer; Item 5; \nFORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h are for two charged-off auto accounts with the same creditor, \nfor $7,560 and $10,697, respectively. Applicant acknowledged during his April 2021 \nbackground interview that he financed $10,000 to buy a car (Car 1) through this \ncreditor. He then traded in Car 1 when he purchased another car (Car 2), as discussed \nbelow in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He was unsure if he still owed a balance on the loan for Car 1. He \nalso acknowledged that he voluntarily surrendered another car (Car 3), which he also \nfinanced through this creditor, but he could not recall specific details about this auto \nloan. He stated in his FORM Response that both debts were charged off. (Item 5; \nFORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $599 gym account in collection. Applicant indicated during his \nApril 2021 background interview that he had this gym membership, in which he paid $25 \nmonthly, between 2019 and 2020. He did not make any payments on this gym \nmembership for over a year, and then he left this gym for another gym. He stated in his \nAnswer that he paid this debt in February 2022. He maintained in his FORM Response \nthat he paid this debt, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. \n(Answer; Item 5; FORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $451 energy account in collection. Applicant indicated during \nhis April 2021 background interview that unbeknownst to him, his ex-spouse used his \nname on this account at a residence she lived in while he was employed overseas. He \nacknowledged that they were married when she did so. Applicant stated in his Answer \nand FORM Response that he paid this debt, but he did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his claim. (Answer; Item 5; FORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $158 gym account in collection. Applicant indicated during his \nApril 2021 background interview that he opened this gym membership between 2011 \nand 2015, while he was self-employed. He assumed that he had an outstanding \nbalance because he did not pay his last membership fee.

Applicant indicated during his April 2021 \nbackground interview that he purchased Car 2 through a loan of approximately $35,000 \nfrom the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He was unable to make monthly payments on his auto \nloan and he surrendered Car 2 in 2016, prior to his overseas employment. He \nacknowledged being told that he might still owe a balance on the loan after he \nvoluntarily surrendered the car, but he never followed up with the creditor. A motor \nvehicle registration record reflects that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g had a lien on Car 2. He \nstated in his FORM Response that both debts were charged off. (Items 5, 6; FORM \nResponse) \nApplicant stated in his FORM Response that his credit score was improving. He \nstated that he was striving to continue to improve his financial status. There is no \nevidence in the record that he received financial counseling. (Form Response; Items 1-\n6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f) \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required\u201d are relevant. Applicant has a history of not paying his \ndebts and being unable to do so. He also failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2013 to 2020. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence \nthat he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He did not provide documentation \nto corroborate his claims that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for TY \n2013 to 2020, or that he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f. Without any proof that \nhe made efforts to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i, his reliance on \ntheir charged-off status is insufficient for mitigation. There is no evidence that he \nreceived any financial counseling.

His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After \na careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor as a surveyor since February 2018. He is a high school graduate. He served \nin the Air National Guard from 1984 to 1990, when he was administratively discharged \nunder other than honorable conditions. He married in 1983 and divorced in 1987. He \nhas one adult child. (Items 2, 3). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2013 through 2019 federal \nincome tax returns, as required, and that he also failed to file his 2015-2017 state \nincome tax returns, as required. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b). Applicant admitted in his August 2020 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2014-2017 federal income \ntax returns. There is no record evidence to support that Applicant failed to timely file his \n2013, 2018, or 2019 federal tax returns as alleged. I find for Applicant on those specific \nyears within SOR \u00b6 1.a. During his August 2021 background investigation interview, he \nconfirmed that he failed to timely file his federal tax returns for 2014-2017. (Items 1 \n(Applicant\u2019s answer), 2, 3) \nApplicant admitted in his security clearance application (SCA) that he failed to \ntimely file his state income tax returns for 2015-2017. He confirmed his SCA admissions \nduring his background interview in August 2021. He also admitted that as of August \n2021, he had not yet filed his state tax returns for 2015-2017. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that the reason that his 2014-2017 federal tax returns and his \n2015-2017 state tax returns were not filed was because the person he had preparing \nand supposedly filing all his returns failed to do so. During his background interview, the \ninvestigator asked Applicant for the name of his tax preparer, which Applicant refused to \ngive. Applicant further claimed that he mailed all of his delinquent federal tax returns \n(2014-2017) to the IRS in November 2021, but he cannot get verification from the IRS \nabout the filing of these returns. He presented no documentation to support his claimed \nactions with the IRS. Concerning his state tax returns for 2015-2017, Applicant claimed \nhe filed the tax returns for 2016 and 2017 in January 2022 and that he now disputes \nhaving to file a state tax return for 2015.

In his SOR \nanswer he asserted that he lives within his means, paid for a new truck in 2019, and \nsaved enough to buy a new home. (Items 1-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014-2017 federal income tax returns and his \n2015-2017 state income tax returns. He claimed that he remedied this by filing his \ndelinquent federal returns in November 2021 and by filing his 2016-2017 delinquent \nstate returns in January 2022. He now believes that he was not required to file a state \ntax return for 2015. He provided no supporting documentation for these assertions. \nEven if he had provided documented proof of his late filings, his years of inaction is a \nsufficient reason by itself to support disqualification. I find AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant claimed that he initially failed to timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns because his tax preparer failed to prepare his tax returns and submit the filings. \nApplicant provided no corroboration for this assertion. He even declined to name who \nthe tax preparer was when asked by his background investigator to do so. While his tax \npreparer\u2019s misfeasance may have been a condition beyond his control, his years of \ndelaying to correct the issue was not responsible action. He failed to document that he \nactually filed his tax returns with the IRS and the state tax authority. He also failed to \ndocument his dispute concerning his requirement to file a state income tax return for \n2015. His non-filing and delay in filing show a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but 20(e) and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

(SOR \u00b6 1.d) (Item 3 at 27-28; Item 4 at 2-3) \nApplicant reported traveling to the PRC to visit family and for tourism in 2003, 2006, \n2009, 2012 (for 21-30 days), 2016 (for greater than 30 days), and 2018 (for 6-10 days). \n(Item 3 at 34-38; Item 4 at 3) \nThe PRC is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the \nparamount authority. China is one of two countries that pose the greatest espionage and \ncyber-attack threats to the United States. China is the most active strategic competitor \nresponsible for cyber espionage against the U.S. Government, corporations and allies. \nThe PRC has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. technology, including sensitive \ntrade secrets and proprietary information to enhance its global strategic, military, \ndiplomatic, and economic influence. China\u2019s focus is on obtaining U.S. information and \ntechnologies beneficial to its military modernization and economic development. About \n80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of \nJustice allege conduct that would benefit the PRC, and at least 60 percent of all trade \nsecret theft cases have at least some nexus to China. (HE I) \nChina\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and entities, frequently \nseek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their \ninsider access to steal secrets. The PRC sometimes uses coercion or blackmail to \nmanipulate its citizens overseas to conduct influence operations on behalf of China. \nAdditionally, the PRC targets individuals in other countries to support its acquisition of \nforeign technology; seeks to recruit individuals primarily, but not exclusively, from relevant \ndiaspora populations and recent emigrants from the PRC, as well as foreign national \nexperts whose recruitment the PRC views as necessary to its scientific and technical \nmodernization, especially with regard to defense technology. The PRC also has \nsignificant human rights issues including pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance, \narbitrary detention, forced labor, trafficking in persons, and has been found to have \ncommitted crimes against humanity against members of ethnic and religious minority \ngroups in the China. (HE I) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden \nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nhis security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nChina. In-laws represent a class of persons contemplated by the Directive as presenting \na potential security risk. As a matter of common sense and human experience, there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of that person\u2019s spouse. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06831 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011). \nChina actively engages in espionage efforts against the United States and exploits \nChinese citizens or persons with family ties to the PRC to gain information. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to her Chinese family members and mother-in-law create a potential conflict \nof interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nThe security concerning condition alleged in SOR \u00b61.b is now moot. Additionally, \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant provides financial support to her mother, a fact relevant to \nassessment of the nature and depth of her relationship with her mother, but it does not \nraise any independent security concern beyond those alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When the \nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, as in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.e one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for \nApplicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China and the adversarial relationship \nChina has with the United States. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n28, 2019). Because of that adversarial relationship, Applicant has a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nof persuasion as to mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2019). In foreign influence cases, the nature of the foreign government and its \nintelligence-gathering history are important considerations. There is a rational connection \nbetween an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are adverse to those of \nthe United States and the risk that the applicant may fail to protect classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-08412 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant has regular, frequent contact with her \nmother, two sisters, and mother-in-law in China, including regular visits. She provides \nregular financial support to her mother and maintains deeply held bonds of affection to \nher mother and sisters, and imputed bonds of affection to her mother-in-law. The foreign \ninfluence concerns are increased because China aggressively and actively engages in \nespionage against the U.S., and seeks to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family \nties to China, especially with regard to defense technology. There is insufficient evidence \nto conclude that the nature of Applicant\u2019s familial connections in China make it unlikely \nthat she would be placed in a position of having to choose between her family interests \nand the interests of the United States. \nApplicant was raised, educated, and lived in China until the age of 29; she then \nentered the U.S. and continued her advanced education, became a U.S. citizen, and has \nraised a family here. She understandably has close ties to her family in China, visits them \nregularly, and maintains close contact. However, there is insufficient evidence to find \nthere is no conflict of interest; either because her sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person or the PRC is so minimal, or because she has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I also considered that Applicant offered \nno documentary evidence in response to the SOR, and did not respond to the FORM, \nand therefore did not submit any additional explanation or evidence about her family \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconnections in China. I conclude that she did not present sufficient evidence to sustain \nthe very heavy burden of persuasion necessary to overcome the security concerns \nestablished by her close connections to her family in China. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. \n26-30; GE 1-3) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $31,000. These delinquencies are credit-card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.d), a car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a business loan for which she is personally \nobligated (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The Government also alleged that Applicant had not timely filed \nher federal income tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Finally, it \nalleged that she did not timely file her State A income tax returns for the 2010 through \n2012 tax years and the 2016 through 2018 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In her Answer, \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.g.

(Answer; GE 1-\n4, 6-9; AE A-K) \nApplicant claimed her financial issues resulted from unemployment and a failed \nbusiness venture. In about 2014, she started a vaping business. The business was \ninitially profitable. However, in 2017, after a change in federal regulations, the business \nbegan losing money and she sold it in 2018. After a brief period of employment with \nanother business in 2018 where she earned $300 to $400 per month, she was \nunemployed from November 2018 until March 2019.

She receives \nabout $900.00 per month in disability pay from the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA). \nShe pays $1,350 per month towards her mortgage. She does not have a car payment, \nbut pays $3,200 every six months for car insurance. Her latest monthly electric bill was \n$250, and she pays $55 per month for cable. Finally, she pays about $630 per month \nfor two personal loans. She has between $750 and $1,000 in her savings account and \nabout $8,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 29, 38-42; GE 4) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $10,335 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not \nbeen resolved.

She claimed that she has \nbeen paying down delinquent debts not listed on the SOR beginning in 2019 after she \nstarting working for her current employer because she had the income to do so. In \nSeptember 2007, while Applicant was serving in the U.S. Army, she was granted a \nsecurity clearance with a warning that her clearance would be suspended if she did not \nresolve her delinquent debts. These 2007 delinquent debts consisted of student loans, a \nresidential lease, and a utility, and were caused by her unemployment prior to her \nmilitary service.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has had financial issues that have been ongoing for at least five years. \nShe had several delinquent credit cards and loans. Beginning in 2017, she did not \ntimely file multiple years of federal and state income tax returns. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nWhile Applicant has provided evidence that she is resolving two of the SOR \ndebts (and two non-SOR debts) through payment arrangements, she has not provided \nevidence that the three other SOR debts are being resolved in a meaningful way. She \nstill has significant unaddressed delinquent debt. She also has not filed all of her \ndelinquent federal and state income tax returns, and she believes that she will have tax \nindebtedness when she does. Her financial issues are ongoing and I cannot find they \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s credit card and loan delinquencies arose as a result of a business \nfailure and unemployment. These conditions were beyond her control. She must also \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshow that she acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. \nWhile she has made and complied with payment arrangements on some of her SOR \nand non SOR debts, having had over three years of gainful employment, her overall \nprogress on her SOR debts is lacking and should be further along. Moreover, her failure \nto timely file her federal and state income tax returns was not due to circumstances \nbeyond her control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nDespite making and complying with payment plans on some of her delinquent \ndebts, Applicant\u2019s failure to make any headway on resolving the majority of her SOR \ndebts makes AG \u00b6 20(d) only partly applicable. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to her \nunfiled federal and state income tax returns. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). While Applicant has filed some of her delinquent income tax returns, \nand has timely filed her federal and state tax returns for a couple of years, she still has \nunfiled state and federal income tax returns for the 2016 tax year. She also believes that \nshe will owe taxes once she does file, which has informed her decision not to file these \nincome tax returns. She has not provided evidence that she has arrangements with the \nIRS or the taxation authority for State A to file her 2016 income tax returns. Likewise, \nshe has not provided evidence that she has and is complying with a payment \narrangement with either of these tax authorities. \nAs none of the mitigating factors is fully applicable, Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an aircraft maintenance technician/inspector \u2013 flight test since December 2019. He was previously employed by another employer as a chief inspector \u2013 quality assurance from May 2011 until July 2019, when he was terminated for having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate. He was on active duty with the U.S. Army from November 2002 until May 2011 when he received an honorable discharge. It is unclear if he is a high school graduate.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an aircraft maintenance technician/inspector \u2013 flight test since December 2019. He \nwas previously employed by another employer as a chief inspector \u2013 quality assurance \nfrom May 2011 until July 2019, when he was terminated for having an inappropriate \nrelationship with a subordinate. He was on active duty with the U.S. Army from November \n2002 until May 2011 when he received an honorable discharge. It is unclear if he is a high \nschool graduate. He received an airframe and power plant certificate in 2009 and earned \nsome university credits but no degree. He was granted a secret clearance in 2006 while \non active duty, and it was renewed in 2016. He was married in 2002 and divorced in 2017. \nHe has two children, born in 2006 and 2016. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, dated December 23, \n2021, and certified on January 26, 2022); Item 2 (SF 86, dated March 13, 2020); Item 3 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 24, 2021); Item 4 (Combined Experian, \nTransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 25, 2020); Item 5 (Equifax Credit \nReport, dated February 24, 2022); and Item 6 (DOD Continuous Evaluation Program \n(CEP) Incident Report, dated November 7, 2018). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant denied having any financial issues associated with \ndelinquent accounts.

During that interview, \nhe disclosed and described multiple financial delinquencies in his name, but claimed that \nthey were not the result of any financial actions by him in causing those accounts to be \nopened, used, or ignored. Instead, he explained that in 2015, he and his wife had paid off \nall of their consumer debt and were financially free. He thought everything was fine until \nhe received a call from the credit union while he was away on a business trip and was \ninformed that a vehicle payment on his wife\u2019s BMW was one month overdue. He asked \nthe credit union representative how much money was in his checking and savings \naccounts, expecting to hear about $10,000, but was told he only had $2,000. He called \nhis wife, the family money manager, and she confessed that she had gambled some of \ntheir money away. \nUpon his return from the business trip, he reviewed the family financial statements \nand realized that his wife, without his knowledge, had taken out all sorts of loans and \nmaxed out credit cards in his name. He realized that when he was on active duty, following \nprotocol, he had given her a general power of attorney, but he forgot to revoke it. Her \nfinancial actions, her gambling problem, and her infidelity caused a huge rift in their \nmarriage, leading to their 2017 divorce. He initially became aware of the late vehicle loan \naccount and a maxed-out credit-card account that he had intended to use for business \ntravel, and later became aware of numerous other delinquent accounts. (Item 3 at 4) \nWhen Applicant was asked why he had denied the existence of the delinquent \naccounts in his SF 86, he responded that he had intentionally done so because he knew \nthe issue would come up during his interview and didn\u2019t want to waste time tracking down \nthe specific information he was supposed to list. He knew that although he is legally liable \nfor the accounts because of his general power of attorney, he considers them to be \n\u201cfraudulent debts.\u201d (Item 3 at 4-5) \nApplicant stated that, out of principle, he had no intentions of making payments on \nany of the debts reported in his credit report because he does not feel that he owes the \nmoney, and decided that he will allow the accounts to simply disappear from his credit \nreport after 7 years. He would \u201crather wait out the clock to start fresh.\u201d (Item 3 at 5, 7) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that although the credit cards were \nissued in his name using a general power of attorney, his wife \u201cracked up every penny of \nthat debt due to her inability to control her gambling habits. [He] did not receive one single \ndime of that money.\u201d He added that he could not litigate the issue during the divorce \nbecause he lacked the money and could not get a line of credit to do so.

(Item 3 at 5; Item 4 at 16) The account has not been resolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity his current financial situation. During his February 2021 OPM interview, \nApplicant claimed to have approximately $6,000 in his checking and savings account. \nDespite claiming that he was paying for everything with cash, Applicant did not report his \nnet monthly income, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for \neven the most insignificant of his delinquent debts such as the water bill). In the absence \nof such information, I am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available \nfor savings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial \nproblems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 15 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $107,032. On \nits face, without any background information, Applicant\u2019s history of still-delinquent debts \nappears to present either an inability to satisfy debts, or a history of not meeting financial \nobligations. His declared unwillingness to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so, is unambiguous. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply, but none of the other conditions apply. As noted \nabove, Applicant attributed his current financial situation to one factor: his ex-wife\u2019s \nwrongful use of his general power of attorney, without his knowledge, to generate cash \nsufficient to support her gambling habit. She misused her position as the family member \nwho handled the family finances, and she illegally used the general power of attorney to \nmaximize financial accounts in his name that she wrongfully used. Her gambling habit, \nher misuse of the general power of attorney, and her infidelity all resulted in their 2017 \ndivorce. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s position regarding his financial situation caused by his ex-wife is \nunderstandable, aspects of his situation and his subsequent actions, or inaction, in \nresolving his financial issues, are troubling. His failure to clarify the nature of the various \ncharges with the creditors to determine his legal or moral responsibility regarding each \nbill indicated that he chose instead to avoid any good-faith efforts to resolve any of the \ndelinquent accounts in his name. Applicant and his wife have two children, born in 2006 \nand 2016. While he told the OPM investigator that he knew very little about any of the \naccounts, a simple examination of some of them might indicate if any of the expenses \nwere related to his children. In particular, there is one delinquent medical account for \n$2,132. Applicant never bothered to contact the provider to determine if the medical \nservices provided were for his children, or even for his wife. Another questionable account \nwas that of the water bill for $92. Applicant never bothered to contact the provider to \nresolve the bill. Those expenses were obviously not to fund a gambling habit. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date he first learned of his financial situation \nfrom the bank and his ex-wife in 2017, the date he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in February 2021, and the date his response to the FORM was expected in \nMay 2022, he made no claimed or verifiable efforts to address ---\nany of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant intentionally ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of his failure to confirm payment of \neven his smallest delinquent account (the water bill for $92), the overwhelming evidence \nleads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted \nresponsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if \nany, efforts of working with his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented \non such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that no \nsuch efforts were anticipated, and he expected to wait seven years until all of the \ndelinquent accounts were removed from his credit report. Not one delinquent debt has \nbeen resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that several of his debts are in charged-off \nstatus. Eventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. \u201c[T]hat \nsome debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current \nfinancial information. Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \naircraft maintenance technician/inspector \u2013 flight test since December 2019. He was \npreviously employed by another employer as a chief inspector \u2013 quality assurance from \nMay 2011 until July 2019. He was on active duty with the U.S. Army from November 2002 \nuntil May 2011 when he received an honorable discharge. He received an airframe and \npower plant certificate in 2009 and earned some university credits but no degree. He was \ngranted a secret clearance in 2006 while on active duty, and it was renewed in 2016. \nApplicant attributed his current financial situation to one factor: his ex-wife\u2019s wrongful use \nof his general power of attorney, without his knowledge, to generate cash sufficient to \nsupport her gambling habit. She misused her position as the family member who handled \nthe family finances, and she illegally used the general power of attorney to maximize \nfinancial accounts in his name that she wrongfully used. Her gambling habit, her misuse \nof the general power of attorney, and her infidelity all resulted in their 2017 divorce. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has 15 still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $107,032. Although Applicant attributed his current financial situation to \nhis ex-wife\u2019s wrongful use of his general power of attorney, without his knowledge, to \ngenerate cash sufficient to support her gambling habit, he repeatedly failed to contact his \ncreditors to examine if any of the accounts were legitimately for the welfare of his wife \nand children. Instead, he allowed his anger regarding the situation to cloud his thought \nprocess. He is determined not to address any of the accounts to learn if they should have \nbeen paid by him. Instead, he is blinded by anger against his ex-wife and is simply \nintending to wait-out the situation to have the accounts fall from his credit report. There \nare lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, \neven those that might be appropriately attributed to his children, and the lengthy period \nof non-contact with his creditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId. (internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra.  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nIn summary, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of her adult life, and she is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting her long-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain \nabout her suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications. According, those doubts must be \nresolved against Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nWhile some of the debts alleged in the SOR arguably resulted from \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control due to medical expenses, unemployment, \nand her husband\u2019s custody dispute, that is only half of the analysis and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to her financial problems must be the second consideration. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, she failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding her circumstances, articulate her position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. She failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding her past efforts to address her outstanding delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more effort towards documented resolution of her past-due debts, and a \nbetter track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 35 years old and was married in 2007 and divorced in 2014. He has no children. He earned a high school diploma in 2005 and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps following graduation. He served on active duty for nine years and deployed on three occasions. He was medically separated in August 2014 under Honorable conditions. Applicant always planned on serving a full 20 years in the Marine Corps. His medical separation was a disappointment for him. At that time, he held the rank of Sergeant (E-5). He has worked as an aircraft technician for his current employer since March 2021. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 6-7, 18-22.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identifies seven past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $37,000 (SOR 1.a through 1.g). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and commented that he has paid one of the debts. The existence and amounts of all seven debts is supported by credit reports dated May 22, 2021; and November 5, 2021. (GE 3 and 4.)

The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 29, 2022. The case was heard as scheduled on June \n15, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 27, 2022. (Tr. at 13-16.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old and was married in 2007 and divorced in 2014. He has \nno children. He earned a high school diploma in 2005 and enlisted in the U.S. Marine \nCorps following graduation. He served on active duty for nine years and deployed on \nthree occasions. He was medically separated in August 2014 under Honorable \nconditions. Applicant always planned on serving a full 20 years in the Marine Corps. His \nmedical separation was a disappointment for him. At that time, he held the rank of \nSergeant (E-5). He has worked as an aircraft technician for his current employer since \nMarch 2021. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 6-7, 18-22.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentifies seven past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $37,000 \n(SOR 1.a through 1.g). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and \ncommented that he has paid one of the debts. The existence and amounts of all seven \ndebts is supported by credit reports dated May 22, 2021; and November 5, 2021. (GE 3 \nand 4.) \nApplicant first started to experience financial problems about one year after he \nseparated from the Marine Corps. He had less income at that time than when he was in \nthe Corps. By 2016, the problems became more acute. He experienced a driving under \nthe influence criminal charge in October 2016 and had to hire an attorney and pay a fine. \nHe described that his financial situation went into a downward spiral at that point. He \nworked as a day laborer from 2017 until 2021. He lived with his parents starting in 2017 \nto reduce his living expenses. He spent a lot of time working with the Veterans \nAdministration on his disability claim. He has a 60% disability rating, but a 0% rating for \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He is presently being reevaluated for PTSD-\nrelated issues. He would like to believe that he does not have PTSD, but he is leaving \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nthat to a professional\u2019s opinion. He believes that his ego and \u201cmilitary mindset\u201d kept him \nfrom asking for help. His lack of work experience and a college degree hurt his ability to \nfind a suitable, good-paying job. On April 9, 2021, Applicant hired a credit-repair company \nto help him address the delinquent debts he had accumulated. He submitted his e-QIP \nabout four weeks later. He \n \nhired the company to repair his credit so that he could qualify \nto purchase a house in the future. (Tr. at 22-30, 34, 44; GE 1 at 33.)  \nThe current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Collection Debt in the Amount of $1,063. Applicant determined that this \ndebt was for a retail-store credit card account. He asserted in his Answer that he has \nsettled the debt and had it removed from his credit report. He testified that he personally \nnegotiated a settlement with the collection agency based upon the advice he received \nfrom his credit advisor. He claims he paid the settlement of the debt in January 2022. This \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. at 30-33; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 1, 2; Answer Exhibit 1 at 1.) \n1.b. Charged-Off Debt in the Amount of $8,089. This debt is for a secured loan. \nApplicant opened this loan in April 2016 to pay and consolidate some debts. The loan \nwas collateralized with a vehicle that Applicant owned without any debt. He stopped \npaying on the debt in October 2016 because he could not keep up with the payments. \nBecause of the age of this debt, Applicant\u2019s credit advisors are telling him to let the debt \nbe removed from his credit report after seven years. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 39-\n41; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 4; Answer Exhibit 1 at 1.)     \n1.c. Charged-Off Debt in the Amount of $4,341. This debt is for an auto loan. \nApplicant opened this loan in April 2016. He stopped paying on the debt in October 2016 \nbecause he no longer had a steady paycheck like he did as a Marine. As with the debt in \nSOR 1.b, his advisors are telling him to wait for the debt to be removed from his credit \nreport after seven years. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 42-44; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4; \nAnswer Exhibit 1 at 1.) \n1.d Collection Debt in the Amount of $424. This debt is for a wireless telephone \naccount. He returned the phone to the service provider, but a balance remained on the \naccount. Applicant intends to pay this debt over the coming months this year, possibly as \nearly as July 2022. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 44-45, 55; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 5.) \n1.e Collection Debt in the Amount of $4,484. Applicant opened this credit-card \naccount in May 2017. He defaulted on the payments a few months later. Under Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cgame plan\u201d he has developed with his advisors, this debt will be one of the last debts \nthat he will repay. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 45-47; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 5.) \n1.f Charged-Off Debt in the Amount of $16,433. Applicant opened this credit-\ncard account in August 2013. He defaulted on the account in August 2016. Applicant does \nnot recall the original purpose of this debt. His credit advisor is disputing this debt to better \nunderstand the debt. Applicant believes this may be a duplicate of other debts owed to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe same creditor. If the debt is valid, he intends to negotiate settlement and pay it \nsometime in the future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 41-42, 47-48; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at \n6.) \n1.g Auto-Lease Account Past Due in the Amount of $2,285. Applicant opened \nthis account in January 2016. He fell behind on three payments in 2017, and the car was \ninvoluntarily repossessed. Applicant believes that the balance due on the debt after the \nsale of the car is about $11,500. Applicant has not yet received guidance from his \nadvisors, so he has not attempted to pay this debt. He intends to repay the debt when he \nis able to negotiate a settlement. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 48-52: GE 3 at 4; GE 4 \nat 8.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is trying to maintain financial stability and not repeat his past mistakes. \nHe puts about $100 per paycheck into a savings account. He intends to use the funds in \nthat account to repay his debts. His current balance in that account is about $600. He \nalso contributes 15% of his paycheck into his employer\u2019s 401(k) plan. He recognizes that \nhe will not be able to continue in his current job past a certain age because the job is \nphysically demanding. He wants to be ready for retirement. (Tr. at 52-56.) \nApplicant has a plan to repay most of his debts one day. The exceptions are the \nthree older debts owed to one creditor. He intends to let them drop off his credit report \ndue to their age. He plans to try to negotiate settlement and make payments of one debt \nevery five months. (Tr. at 52-56.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $37,000 for seven past-due debts, as of the date \nthe SOR was issued. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying conditions applicable \nand shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nEach of the above mitigating conditions has partial application. Most of \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose in or about 2016 or 2017. Applicant has only recently \nobtained employment that gives him a modest amount of excess cash after paying \nhis current expenses. It is too soon to say confidently that new debts are unlikely \nto recur or that his past behavior does not cast doubts on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose for reasons beyond his \ncontrol. When he was separated from the Marine Corps, he did not have a plan on \nhis future employment. His finances suffered for several years. It was only recently \nthat he obtained employment that paid him sufficiently well to be able to live on his \nown and pay his living expenses. He acted responsibly by hiring a consultant that \nhe could afford, but the consultant provides minimal services, mostly in the nature \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof advice of how he should plan his next steps and how he can negotiate \nsettlements. He has been successful in paying one debt since April 2021 when he \nhired the consultant. Applicant hopes to pay a second smaller debt in the coming \nmonths. There is no indication in the record, however, that his creditors with the \nlarger debts will agree to small settlements that Applicant can afford. It is too early \nin Applicant\u2019s debt repayment efforts to find that he will be successful with his \nnegotiations and payments within a reasonable period of time. Applicant has not \npresented sufficient evidence of debt resolutions to show there are clear \nindications that his financial problems ae being resolved or are under control. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (c) are only partially established. \nFor the same reason \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. He has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay some of his over-due creditors and has paid one of them. \nHowever, his evidence in mitigation does not support a conclusion that he is \nadhering to his plan when so little has been accomplished since he started his job \nover a year ago. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s plan does not include paying the three \nlargest creditors with the oldest debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s medical separation form the Marine Corps set in motion some \ndifficult times for him. His divorce the same year made his life even more difficult. It was \nnot until seven years later that he found suitable employment and was presented with the \nopportunity to get his life back on track. Since 2021, he has begun the process of seeking \nto minimize the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecurrence of financial problems. He has not, however, provided sufficient evidence that \nhis financial problems are under control. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. At some point between January 7, 2022, and February 11, 2022, SOR \u00b6 1.b. was withdrawn. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a mechanical engineer with his current employer since July 2014. A 2010 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2014. Although he had previously applied for a security clearance, his eligibility was denied in 2016, essentially because of drug involvement and substance misuse, personal conduct, and issues regarding his candor over the frequency of his drug involvement and substance misuse. (Item 3 at 83- 84) He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been married. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Applicant was a recreational or experimental multi-substance abuser whose substances of choice during an 13-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana [used for recreation and to assist him to sleep for leisure and enjoyment somewhere between 150 and 300 times from about July 2008 to about April 2021]; psilocybin mushrooms [used four times from June",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 11, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories, and \nalso asked him to verify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. He \nresponded to those interrogatories and verified the summary on November 17, 2021. On \nDecember 8, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) and detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 7, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on February 14, 2022, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 \ndays, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on March \n8, 2022. His response was due on April 7, 2022. Applicant chose not to respond to the \nFORM, for as of April 26, 2022, no response had been received. The case was assigned \nto me on May 19, 2022. The record closed on April 7, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.g.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. At some point \nbetween January 7, 2022, and February 11, 2022, SOR \u00b6 1.b. was withdrawn. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a mechanical engineer with his current employer since July 2014. A 2010 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2014. Although he had previously \napplied for a security clearance, his eligibility was denied in 2016, essentially because of \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, personal conduct, and issues regarding his \ncandor over the frequency of his drug involvement and substance misuse. (Item 3 at 83-\n84) He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been married.  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational or experimental multi-substance abuser whose \nsubstances of choice during an 13-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known \nas marijuana [used for recreation and to assist him to sleep for leisure and enjoyment \nsomewhere between 150 and 300 times from about July 2008 to about April 2021]; \npsilocybin mushrooms [used four times from June 2014 to about January 2019]; and \nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy [used out of curiosity \none time about July 2016] \u2013 all Schedule I Controlled Substances; amphetamine (the \nprescription medication Adderall\u00ae which was not prescribed for him) [used out of curiosity \nand to assist him to focus on a college paper once in about February 2011]; and cocaine \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n[used out of curiosity two times from about August 2017 to about January 2019] \u2013 both \nSchedule II Controlled Substances; and Ketamine (a prescription drug used primarily for \ninduction and maintenance of anesthesia and for its hallucinogenic and dissociative \neffects which was not prescribed for him [used once out of curiosity] \u2013 a Schedule III \nControlled Substance. (Item 2 at 2-4; Item 3 at 77-81; Item 4 at 10-11; \n(https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c)) He purchased the \nmarijuana he used under 50 times while in high school and college before marijuana \nbecame legalized in the state in which he was residing. (Item 3 at 80-81) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on June 17, 2021. He acknowledged his involvement in the illegal \nuse of controlled substances, including his misuse of prescription drugs, as described \nabove. With one exception, he claimed he could not recall the identities of the individuals \nfrom whom he obtained his drugs or with whom he used the substances. (Item 4 at 10-\n11)  \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s future intentions, he placed the drugs in separate \ncategories. In order to obtain and retain a security clearance, he is willing to abstain from \ncertain substances so long as they remain illegal and he has a security clearance. \nHowever, if they become legalized, or if he no longer has a security clearance, he may \nreturn to using them. Marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms fall within that category. As \nfor cocaine, Ecstasy, and Ketamine, because he did not enjoy them when he tried them, \nhe had no intentions of using them in the future. (Item 3 at 77-80; Item 4 at 11) \nHowever, past performance and actions may, instead, prove to be more reliable \nthan stated future intentions. As noted above, in 2016, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance was denied essentially because of drug involvement and substance misuse, \npersonal conduct, and issues regarding his candor over the frequency of his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. Nevertheless, although he has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since 2014, and he had applied for a security clearance, Applicant \ncontinued to experiment with a number of the above identified substances as well as \nregularly continue to use other illegal substances, regardless of the fact that such use \nwas illegal in most instances. \nThere is no evidence of Applicant ever having received drug-counseling or \ntreatment. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ;  \nand \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of a variety of \nSchedule I, Schedule II, and Schedule III Controlled Substances. He frequently \npurchased and used marijuana; consumed psilocybin mushrooms; used Ecstasy; used \nthe prescription medications Adderall\u00ae and Ketamine which were not prescribed for him; \nand used cocaine. Although he consistently claimed to have no future intentions of using \ncertain identified drugs or controlled substances, in fact, his intentions are considered \nessentially contingent on his holding a security clearance and the legality of the \nsubstance(s) in question. The legality obviously had no bearing on his use of various \nsubstances in the past, and he continued to use them. His expressed comments \nregarding future drug involvement and substance misuse fail to clearly and convincingly \ncommit himself to discontinue such misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. After approximately 13 years of regular \nmulti-substance drug involvement and substance misuse, and one failed attempt to obtain \na security clearance, Applicant continued using Ecstasy as recently as July 2016; using \nKetamine as recently as April 2018; using cocaine until as recently as January 2019; \nconsuming psilocybin mushrooms as recently as January 2019; and purchasing and \nusing marijuana until as recently as April 2021. His misuse of Adderall\u00ae took place a \ndecade earlier. He was actually open about his use of illegal substances when he \ncompleted his SF 86, responded to the investigator\u2019s questions, and answered the SOR, \nand for that candor, he is given some credit. While he has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement, he has offered no evidence of actions taken to overcome those issues, such \nas exploring drug treatment and therapy; changing or avoiding the environment where \nthe drugs were used; or disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \napproximately 13 years of multi-substance use and misuse, the relatively brief period of \napproximately one year of reported unverified abstinence is considered insufficient to \nconclude that the abstinence, or promise of contingent abstinence, will continue, \nespecially after he admitted using various drugs after unsuccessfully applying for a \nsecurity clearance in 2016, and now offering a contingent promise regarding future \nsubstance abuse. \nApplicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in stark \ncontrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His \ncasual, experimental, repeated, or regular use of all of the identified substances; his \nrepeated purchase of marijuana; and his misuse of prescription drugs without possessing \na prescription for the drugs despite knowing that such use was prohibited; his failure to \nfurnish information regarding his drug-using friends; the absence of any drug-counseling \nor treatment; and his apparent refusal to disassociate from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 29-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a mechanical engineer with \nhis current employer since July 2014. A 2010 high school graduate, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2014. When completing his SF 86, he was candid in \nacknowledging that he had used a variety of illegal substances. When questioned by an \nOPM investigator, he was candid regarding his illegal drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. His professed claims regarding future intentions were actually contingent upon \ncertain factors. He claims, without verifiable support, that he has been abstinent since \nApril 2021. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nOver a 13-year period, Applicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of \na variety of Schedule I, Schedule II, and Schedule III Controlled Substances. He \nfrequently purchased and used sold marijuana; consumed psilocybin mushrooms; used \nEcstasy; used the prescription medications Adderall\u00ae and Ketamine, neither of which \nwere prescribed for him; and used cocaine. Although he consistently claimed to have no \nfuture intentions of using certain identified drugs or controlled substances, in fact, his \nintentions are considered essentially contingent on his holding a security clearance and \nthe legality of the substance(s) in question. The legality obviously had no bearing on his \nuse of various substances in the past, and he continued to use them, even after a failed \napplication for a security clearance in 2016. His failure to furnish information regarding \nhis drug-using friends; the absence of any drug-counseling or treatment; and his apparent \nrefusal to disassociate himself from his drug-using associates, continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.c. through 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He was previously granted a Top Secret clearance with access \nto Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) while on active duty in the Navy. At the \ntime of the hearing, he did not hold an active security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 10-11, 21-30) \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent debts, totaling $20,937. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, a $14,909 consumer debt that was opened in May 2011, and placed for collection in \napproximately January 2015. He stated in his answer to the SOR, \u201cThis debt is no longer \ncollectable as it has passed statute of limitations and no longer appears on my credit \nreport.\u201d He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b, a $6,028 automobile debt that was opened in June 2014 \nand placed for collection in June 2016. He stated in his answer to the SOR, \u201cWhile this \ndebt does exist on my credit report it will pass statute of limitations either this month or in \nApril, then no longer be collectable.\u201d (Answer, GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 6) \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to his first divorce and periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. He was unemployed from January 2019 to May \n2019. From April 2016 to April 2017, he was in school full time and not employed. When \nhe left active duty in 2014, he did not have a job \u201clined up\u201d for when he returned home. \nHe used the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill) to attend college courses, \nand it was only sufficient to pay for some of his expenses, such as housing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able \nto cover the large debts that I had left, so I kind of just let them slide. It was a bad decision, \nbut I couldn\u2019t make it work at the time.\u201d (GE 1; GE 4; AE A; Tr. 18) \nIn June 2019, Applicant disclosed both of the debts alleged in SOR in his SCA. He \nindicated that he intended to \u201ccontact a credit assistance service or [his] bank about debt \nconsolidation, to get all [his] unpaid debts together and clear them. With the debt and \nincome [he] had [he] was unable to cover payments and be in a livable state. Now with a \nstable job and income, [his] first priority is to clear all [his] debts.\u201d (GE 1 at 46-47) \nIn October 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator, and \nhis financial issues were discussed.

He told the investigator that after recently moving from \nState A to State B, his income had doubled and his then wife (second) also had a stable \njob. Their top priority was to resolve their outstanding debts and contact a debt \nconsolidator. (GE 4 at 2-3) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he had forgotten about his delinquent debts \nuntil 2019, when he applied for a top secret security clearance for his current job. At some \npoint in 2019 or 2020, after his October 2019 interview, Applicant contacted a credit-\nconsolidation company. He was told he could consolidate his debt, pay a fee to the \ncompany, and pay his debts for several years, or he could wait until the seven-year statute \nof limitations (SOL) expired (for the two debts alleged in the SOR). He did not ask for \nadvice as to how relying on the expirations of the SOL would affect his ability to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He could afford to make payments toward the two alleged SOR debts, \nbut he reasoned: \n[I] would probably still be paying on them for another few years unless I \nlump sum paid them if I could, now that I have a lot of money. But the \u2026 \nhitting of the statute of limitations and no longer being collectable was kind \nof my plan at that point. (GE 4; Tr. 19, 33-34, 40-44) \nIn July 2022, Applicant purchased a home for $285,000. He used the GI Bill to \npurchase it and could not afford a down payment. As of the hearing, he had not yet made \na payment, nor had his partner moved in with him to share the expenses of the house. \n(Tr. 20-21, 28, 46) \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 credit report reflects that he had two other smaller delinquent \ndebts that he paid in March 2021 ($221 \u2013 car insurance and $1,441 \u2013 cellular phone) and \none debt ($1,878 \u2013 education related) that was resolved through the confiscation of his \nfederal income tax refund. He paid the two unalleged debts, because they were placed \nfor collection in October 2020 and December 2017, respectively, and the statute of \nlimitations did not apply to them. (GE 3; Tr. 19, 41-43) \nApplicant testified that the $14,909 personal loan or credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, was opened in May 2011, and used primarily to pay for vehicle repairs. He stopped \npaying this debt shortly after he left active duty in July 2014. He initially tried to negotiate \nlower payments, and then stopped making payments. The creditor attempted to collect \nthe debt, but he did not have the funds to pay it. He has not been in contact with the \ncreditor since approximately 2014, and the debt fell off his credit report in approximately \nSeptember 2021. He did not provide documentation as to the relevant state\u2019s SOL. (GE \n1-4; AE A; Tr. 31-34, 44) \nWhen Applicant was unable to adequately repair the vehicle mentioned above, he \npurchased a new car when he returned to his hometown in 2014. He was unable to make \nthe payments on the loan, and it was repossessed approximately one or two years after \nhe purchased it. The credit reports indicate that his last payment was made in June 2016. \nThe $6,028 balance of the car loan is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.

(GE 1-4; AE A; Tr. 34-36, 39-40, \n44) \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $4,800, and he has a monthly remainder of \nbetween $800 and $1,000. Other than the brief credit counseling that he attended in 2019 \nor 2020, he has sought no other financial counseling services. At the time of the hearing, \nhe had $300 in savings. He does not use a written budget. He is not required to pay child \nsupport for his son. The August 2022 credit report that he submitted after the hearing \nreflects no new delinquent debts. (AE C; Tr. 23, 45-51) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s DD-214, he received the following awards and \ndecorations while serving in the Navy: Good Conduct Medal (2nd  Award); National \nDefense Service Medal; and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. (AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant experienced a difficult transition period after he left active duty in the \nNavy in July 2014. He allowed a credit card to become delinquent. Additionally, he \npurchased a new vehicle that he owned for a year or two before he stopped making \npayments, which resulted in the vehicle\u2019s repossession. He made no attempts to resolve \neither of these debts, totaling $20,937, until he reapplied for a security clearance in June \n2019. In his SCA, he acknowledged the debts underlying both SOR allegations and \nindicated that it was his intent to resolve them. He reiterated this intent during his October \n2019 interview with a government investigator. \nApplicant met with a credit-consolidation company in 2019 or 2020 and learned \nthat both of these debts were approximately 18 months away from the expiration of the \nSOL. Upon learning this information, he decided against establishing payment \narrangements or making payments on his delinquent accounts. He did not provide \ndocumentation from the credit-consolidation company he consulted or other \ndocumentation indicating what state\u2019s SOL is applicable to each SOR allegation. Although \nneither of these debts appear in his August 2022 credit report, the Appeal Board has held \nthat reliance upon a debt falling off of a credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution. Additionally, even if neither of the alleged debts is legally enforceable under \nstate law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to pay it in a timely \nmanner. \nIn this case, Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that he could afford to make \npayments toward SOR allegations, but chose not to do so. He repaid two smaller \ndelinquent debts in March 2021, because they were newer and the SOL was not \napplicable to them. This behavior does not reflect financial responsibility. He has not \ndemonstrated he has acted responsibly under the circumstances to address and resolve \nhis delinquent debts in a timely manner. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) was not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, including his years of honorable service in the Navy. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, he \nhas not demonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I \nconclude he did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

(\u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 24-28, 37; GE 2; SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant testified that she and her husband separated in November 2015, and \ntheir divorce became final in 2016. At that time, she believed her finances were good and \nshe purchased a new car in 2016. She stopped operating her business in 2016 even \nthough she said it was a very profitable business.

Applicant estimated that she provided around $5,000 to her \ndaughter, and this prevented her from paying on some of her delinquent accounts. (Tr. \n29-30, 46-47) \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent accounts totaling $63,535, as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant is indebted to State A in the amount of $3,003 for \na tax lien entered against her in December 2017. At the hearing, Applicant stated that she \ncurrently owes about $300 for unpaid 2016 taxes. She could not remember if the tax issue \nstemmed from her personal income taxes or from her business. She stated that she had \nmade voluntary payments until she could no longer make any more payments. Thereafter, \nState A garnished her wages to pay for the tax lien until about February 2020, when her \nemployment contract ended and she was out of a job. After the hearing, Applicant \nprovided a document showing that, as of December 2022, she owed $180.68 to State A \nfor unpaid 2016 taxes. This tax debt is being paid. (Tr. 37-40; AE G) \nApplicant is indebted to seven medical service providers for unpaid medical bills in \nthe total amount of $5,985. (SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e - 1.j). Applicant initially denied these debts \nin her Answer because she was unaware of all of these delinquent accounts. She testified \nthat she is using the services of Credit One Solutions to address and resolve these debts. \nDepartment Counsel pointed out that her documentation from the credit-repair \norganization (AE A) did not show that they were addressing any of her unpaid medical \naccounts. She stated that it is her intention to pay these delinquent medical accounts as \nlong as they are reported on her credit report properly. She has not made any payments \non any of these delinquent debts, and they remain unresolved. (Tr. 42-45; AE A, AE I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. alleges that Applicant is indebted in the amount of $661 for an account \nplaced into collection with a law firm. Applicant testified this debt was for attorney\u2019s fees \narising from her divorce, and that her ex-husband was supposed to pay these fees. She \ncalled the law firm in 2018 or 2019, but since that time, she has not contacted this creditor. \nShe informed Credit One Solutions of this outstanding legal fee, but she is not sure if the \ncompany is taking any action. Department Counsel asked her if she could provide \ndocumentation to show that her ex-husband is responsible for this debt. Applicant did not \nsubmit any corroborating documentation while the record was held open. This debt \nremains unresolved. (Tr. 47-49) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. alleges that Applicant is indebted to an apartment complex in the \napproximate amount of $2,771 for a broken lease agreement. She stated that in 2018 she \nwas living in the apartment with her son. He kept having nosebleeds due to mold in their \napartment. She contacted the rental office and informed them she was moving out. She \nadmitted that she broke her one-year lease agreement, although she denied this account \nin her Answer. She testified that she received advice from Credit One Solutions to pay \nthis debt. She called the creditor the day before the hearing and they agreed upon a \npayment plan.

She testified that after the divorce she purchased the timeshare for \nher children. She stopped making payments in about 2020, when she had to provide \nfinancial assistance to her daughter. Credit One Solutions is disputing this account due \nto inaccurate reporting. Applicant\u2019s intention is to either pay this account or sell the \ntimeshare, if permitted.

Applicant is indebted to a credit union for a vehicle loan charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $32,562. She testified she incurred this loan to purchase a \nnew car after her divorce. She claimed that the credit union changed the loan from a \nvehicle loan to a signature loan, which increased the interest rate. Even though she still \npossesses the vehicle, she has not made any car payments for the last two years because \nthe credit union would not accept her payments. Credit One Solutions is disputing this \ndelinquent account and expects to file a lawsuit in the next 60-90 days.

There is no resolution of this debt in the record and the account remains \nunpaid. (Tr. 55-58; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. Applicant is indebted to a credit union in the amount of approximately \n$3,558 for a charged-off signature loan. She testified that she is responsible for this debt. \nShe took out this loan to pay for a comedy performance at a community event. However, \nwhen the credit union changed her vehicle loan into a signature loan, as stated above, \nshe had a \u201chissy-fit,\u201d especially after she was subjected to disrespectful treatment from \nthe credit union representatives.

In September 2019, she told the government authorized investigator that she \ndid not recognize this same account, but she intended to do research to determine if this \nwas her account, and if so, she would arrange payments with the creditor. Applicant has \nnot made any payments on this account. She is relying on Credit One Solutions to handle \nthis delinquent account. This debt remains unpaid. (GE 8; Tr. 61-64) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p.

(Tr. 66-67) \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.s) Applicant is indebted to a collection agency for two accounts (city \nand waste/recycling) in the total amount of $234.

Department Counsel asked for documentation \nthat would verify the accounts were paid while the record was held open. There is no \nresolution of this debt in the record and the accounts remain unpaid. (Tr. 67) \nApplicant started using the services of Credit One Solutions, a credit repair \norganization, about a year-and-a-half ago. She pays $99 a month for their service, and it \ndoes not appear that any of that money is used to pay her delinquent creditors. Earlier, \nshe had used the services of another consumer credit company, but after being \ndissatisfied with that company, she switched to Credit One Solutions. She reported to \nCredit One Solutions that she had an upcoming security clearance interview, and it was \n\u201cimperative\u201d that she had \u201ca good credit report.\u201d She is satisfied with Credit One Solutions \nbecause they have organized her debts and helped her establish a monthly budget. (Tr. \n69-71, 77-78, 84) \nApplicant testified that she nets about $463 every week from her paycheck, after \ndeductions and the tax lien wage garnishment. She also receives about $2,783 in alimony \nevery month from her ex-husband, who is paying the amount in full and on-time every \nmonth. She recently began working a part-time marketing job at a winery, and she \nreceives between about $150-$500 a month for her services. She submitted a personal \nfinancial statement that shows she has a net remainder of about $1,535, after paying her \nmonthly expenses. She testified that lately she does not have that much money left over \nbecause she has been helping her daughter and grandkids. She currently has about $800 \nin her savings account, and $700 in her checking account. (Tr. 71-77; AE H) \nCharacter Evidence \nFour character references praised Applicant\u2019s honesty, reliability, and excellent \nwork ethic.

(AE C, AE D, AE E, AE \nF) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nBy Applicant\u2019s credit reports and admissions, the Government established that \nApplicant has 18 delinquent accounts totaling $63,535, to include her unpaid 2016 state \ntaxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolve or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation.

Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to loss of income and inconsistent \nalimony support from her husband following their 2016 divorce. In addition, she has \nprovided unexpected financial support to her daughter and grandkids on more than one \noccasion, and to her financial detriment. Notwithstanding these events that impacted her \nfinances, Applicant must demonstrate that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She admitted that her lack of oversight, such as organizing her delinquent \ndebts and creating a workable budget, also contributed to her financial delinquencies. \nShe is currently using the services of a credit-repair organization, and she has \nparticipated in financial counseling. The credit-repair organization reported to Applicant \nthat she should pay the creditor for her broken lease agreement. The day before the \nhearing, Applicant called the creditor to arrange a payment plan. There is no evidence in \nthe record that she has ever made a voluntary payment to that creditor. \nIt is clear from the record that Applicant made several poor financial decisions \nfollowing her divorce. She stopped operating her business that was profitable, she \npurchased a new car, she broke a rental lease agreement, and she purchased a \ntimeshare that she could not afford. In September 2019, she was interviewed about the \ndelinquent credit accounts reported on her credit report. She stated to the investigator \nthat she would look into these accounts, and if they were her responsibility, she would \narrange payments. That interview took place more than three years ago. There is no \nevidence that she made any voluntary payment arrangements with her delinquent SOR \ncreditors, or that she voluntarily paid, resolved, or successfully disputed any of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. The only debt being paid is the (involuntary) wage garnishment issued \nby State A to recover her delinquent 2016 unpaid taxes after she stopped making \nvoluntary payments. Overall, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated that she acted \nresponsibly to address her financial delinquencies. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has failed to demonstrate that she has acted responsibly to address and \nresolve her financial delinquencies. Her lack of action reflects poor judgment and \nunreliability. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l), noting that several of the smaller debts had been paid off. He provided a narrative explanation but no documents. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. He was married for about 14 months, from November 2005 to February 2007. The marriage ended in divorce, with no children. He has lived with a cohabitant since 2009, and disclosed two children born since then, ages 12 and 10. (Item 2, Item 3) After graduating from high school in 2002 (Item 3), Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from March 2003 to September 2012. He was discharged honorably, with the rank of staff sergeant (E-5), due to injuries he sustained in an auto accident. (Item 2) Since June 2012, he has worked for a large defense contractor, employed on an Air Force base as an aircraft supervisor. (Item 2) He has held a clearance since 2003, when he joined the Air Force. (Item 3 at 3) Applicant submitted an SCA in October 2019. He disclosed several delinquent debts, and explained that after a second auto accident, in August 2018, he was placed on disability for nine months, and his income was reduced to 75% of what it was. As a result, he fell behind on his payments and financial obligations. He noted that he had retained a d",

DOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant \nthe same day, and on May 17, 2022, he signed a receipt for it and sent a confirming e-\nmail to DOHA. He was afforded 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.  \nApplicant did not otherwise respond to the FORM, and on May 13, 2022, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision. The SOR and the answer (combined as Item 1) are \nthe pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 9 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts alleged in the SOR \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l), noting that several of the smaller debts had been paid off. He provided \na narrative explanation but no documents. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He was married for about 14 months, from November \n2005 to February 2007. The marriage ended in divorce, with no children. He has lived \nwith a cohabitant since 2009, and disclosed two children born since then, ages 12 and \n10. (Item 2, Item 3) \nAfter graduating from high school in 2002 (Item 3), Applicant served in the U.S. Air \nForce from March 2003 to September 2012. He was discharged honorably, with the rank \nof staff sergeant (E-5), due to injuries he sustained in an auto accident. (Item 2) Since \nJune 2012, he has worked for a large defense contractor, employed on an Air Force base \nas an aircraft supervisor. (Item 2) He has held a clearance since 2003, when he joined \nthe Air Force. (Item 3 at 3) \nApplicant submitted an SCA in October 2019. He disclosed several delinquent \ndebts, and explained that after a second auto accident, in August 2018, he was placed \non disability for nine months, and his income was reduced to 75% of what it was. As a \nresult, he fell behind on his payments and financial obligations. He noted that he had \nretained a debt collection agency to help him resolve several of his accounts, and was \npaying $25 per week, per account, until the account is paid off. (Item 2; Items 8, 9) \nThe record includes three credit bureau reports (CBRs), dated November 2019, \nSeptember 2021, and February 2022, which establish the delinquent accounts alleged in \nthe SOR. (Items 1, 5, 6, 7) He discussed his debts in his background interview and \nprovided updated information, including documentation about various debts and a July \n2021 CBR, in an August 2021 interrogatory response. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR debts total about $39,000. The debts are detailed as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($20,120), 1.b ($5,983), and 1.c ($9,240) are accounts that have been \ncharged off by a bank (the same creditor for each account). These accounts represent \nabout $35,000 of the $39,000 alleged SOR debts. They became past due in 2018 or \n2019, were placed for collection, and have now been charged off. (Items 6, 7) Applicant \ndisclosed these three debts on his SCA. (Item 1) He said in his interrogatory response \nthat the debts remained unpaid and he provided no additional documentation about them. \n(Item 4 at 3, 4, 9) He provided no additional information in his SOR response about these \ndebts, which remain unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($758) is a past-due auto-loan account. (Item 4 at 11-12) As of February \n2022, the account was in repossession status with a balance of $3,725, of which $1,138 \nis now past due. (Item 7 at 5) Applicant admitted the debt and provided no additional \ninformation in his SOR response. The account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($985) is an account that has been charged off. This is an auto loan, \ninitially for $27,585. The account was charged off in October 2019. (Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at \n3; Item 7 at 6) Applicant admitted the debt, noted in his interrogatory response that the \naccount remained unpaid, and provided no additional information. (Item 4 at 4) . The \naccount is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,537) is an account that has been placed for collection. (Item 6 at 2; \nItem 7 at 2) Applicant admitted the debt, noted in his interrogatory response that the \naccount remained unpaid and provided no additional information in his SOR response. \nThe account is unresolved. (Item 4 at 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($258), 1.h ($56), 1.i ($10), 1.j ($60), 1.k ($57), and 1.l ($57) are all \nmedical debts reported for collection. (Item 5 at 7-8, Item 6 at 3) In his SOR response, \nApplicant reports that all of these accounts have been paid. Though he provides no \ndocumentation, the credit reports support that the accounts have been paid. I consider \nthese debts resolved. \nIn his interrogatory response, Applicant provided a personal financial statement \n(PFS) and a paystub, among other documents. He earns about $104,000 annually. In his \nPFS, he only listed one debt: his $1,852 mortgage. (Item 4 at 10, 13) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant noted that he has held a clearance both in \nthe Air Force and with his current employer, without incident. He said that after his August \n2018 auto accident he was on disability for six months, reducing his income to 60% of \nwhat it was (rather than 75% and for nine months, as he noted earlier). He said he is \ngetting back on his feet but has had some setbacks. He said he had paid off over half of \nthe debts in the SOR, and was beginning to address the rest. He said many of his debts \nwere medical bills related to injuries from the accident, since the VA\u2019s medical insurance \ndenied out-of-network providers who treated him. (Item 1 at 8) \nApplicant provided no documentation with his SOR response.

While he indicated that \u201cover half\u201d of his SOR debts \nhave been paid, this appears to refer to the number of debts of which he says that the \nsmallest six debts, all medical accounts, have been paid off. That accounts for about $500 \nin debt payments, out of about $39,000 in delinquent accounts alleged and admitted. \nApplicant noted that when he pays off one account, he moves on to the next, and believes \nhe is on a good path to address his accounts in collection. (Item 1 at 8) \nApplicant provided no documentation to support his assertions that his financial \nstability has improved. The record did not indicate that he participated in credit counseling \nthrough the debt collection agency he mentioned in his SCA or otherwise. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred numerous debts in recent years. The debts are established by \nthe credit reports in the record, and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant stated that his income suffered after he went on disability for several \nmonths following an August 2018 auto accident. His debts post-date this event, which is \na circumstance beyond his control that has impacted his finances. Several small debts, \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.l, are medical debts, likely related to his accident, and \nthey are resolved. For full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must establish that \nhe has acted reasonably under the circumstances. Even if Applicant is addressing his \ndebts one at a time, only about $500 of his debts have been paid off. He sets forth no \nevidence of action to address his larger debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. Similarly, \nhe did not provide sufficient evidence under AG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering \nto a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his non-medical debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, \nas Applicant has not shown that he has participated in credit counseling or that his debts \nare being resolved or are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nGiven the limited documentation in the case, and the small amount of debt that is \nresolved compared with the amount outstanding, Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even if they occurred due to a decline in income \nfollowing an auto accident. I considered his career in the Air Force and with his current \nemployer as favorable whole person evidence. Since Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him in a hearing about the \nstatus of his SOR debts, to better assess the reasonableness of his actions in addressing \nthem. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

White, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/19/2022 \nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, but did mitigate the concerns regarding personal conduct. Eligibility \nfor a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 1, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nApplication for a Security Clearance (SF 86). On May 6 and May 8, 2021, an investigator \nfrom the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviewed him. On an \nunspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set \nof interrogatories and asked him to verify the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s summary of \nhis triggered enhanced subject interviews. He responded to those interrogatories and \nverified the interview summaries on an unspecified date. On February 11, 2022, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the \nDCSA CAF adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated April 14, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on March 10, 2022. Because of the health \nprotection protocols associated with COVID-19, hearings were essentially placed on hold. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 17, 2022. A Notice of Microsoft Teams Video \nTeleconference Hearing was issued on November 8, 2022, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on November 15, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through I were marked and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. \nThe transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on November 28, 2022. I kept the record \nopen to enable Applicant to supplement it, and he timely submitted one document that \nwas marked and admitted as AE J without objection. The record closed on December 6, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with brief comments, most of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nand 1.b.). He failed to address the personal conduct allegation until the hearing when he \ndenied the allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a developer with his current employer since March 2021. He previously worked for \nother employers as an administrator (March 2017 \u2013 December 2020) or team manager \n(February 2007 \u2013 February 2014). He was unemployed on two occasions (February 2014 \n\u2013 August 2016 and January 2021 \u2013 March 2021), after he was either terminated or laid \noff. He chose to attend community college during both periods. A 2001 high school \ngraduate, he is two courses short of obtaining an associate\u2019s degree. He has never served \nin the U.S. military. He was married in 2007, and has two children, born in 2009 and 2011. \nAlthough he denied in his SF 86 ever having been granted a security clearance, he \nadmitted in his Answer to the SOR that he had used marijuana \u201cafter having been granted \naccess to classified information.\u201d During the hearing, he retracted that portion of the \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegation and denied that he had ever been granted access to classified information. (Tr. \nat 33-34) Because of the inconsistency regarding that issue, I requested that Department \nCounsel obtain and submit a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) report \nindicating if or when Applicant had been granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 37) No such \ninformation was submitted. In the absence of more conclusive evidence that a security \nclearance had ever been granted to Applicant, I have concluded that the evidence is \ninsufficient to support any finding that he had been granted one. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct \nApplicant presented two different scenarios regarding his history of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. According to his SF 86 submission, he claimed he \nhad been training for long distance running and suffered a collapsed foot arch. He \nresorted to a holistic approach to his fitness, and in May 2008, he started using \u2013 \u201cmaybe \na handful of times\u201d \u2013  tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I \nControlled Substance. (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 \n(c)) in an attempt to mitigate his injury while avoiding any long-term side effects from pain \nmedication. He later obtained orthotic inserts and combined with the marijuana, he \ncorrected his arch and speeded up his recovery. (GE 1 at 41)  \nHowever, during his OPM interview on May 6, 2021, his story changed. What had \npreviously been described as \u201cmaybe a handful of times\u201d starting in March 2008 for \nmedicinal purposes became \u201chabitually . . . once per week, unknown number of times (in \nthe several hundreds)\u201d for nutritional and medicinal purposes. He was treated for heal \npain on two verified occasions in November and December 2020 and prescribed \northotics. (AE H; AE I) He initially purchased the marijuana illegally from various \nindividuals prior to 2021, but at some point around March 2021, he obtained a medical \nlicense to \u201clegally\u201d purchase marijuana. He stated that he has no plans to stop using \nmarijuana, at least until someone at his place of employment tells him it is unacceptable \nto continue using it. He claimed that his supervisor and facility security officer were aware \nof his current use of marijuana as well as his extensive use of it in the past 13 years, but \nno-one indicated his marijuana use constituted any criminal offense or that it violated any \nemployer regulations. During that interview, Applicant kept referring to his \u201csecurity \nclearance\u201d and the fact that he had been granted one by his employer. (GE 2 at 9-11) \nApplicant initially denied ever engaging in counseling for his marijuana use and \ndoes not believe he needs such counseling. (GE 2 at 10) During the hearing, he claimed \nthat he had contacted a substance abuse therapist to start a recovery and substance \nabuse program. (Tr. at 29-31) He subsequently submitted a schedule of \u201ccounseling\u201d \nappointments with a counselor, without describing her background and area of expertise \nor the type of counseling received, indicating only that he had paid for six sessions \nbetween April 6, 2022, and May 11, 2022. (AE J) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent use of marijuana took place in January 2022. While he \nclaimed that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, he might do so if it is \nrecommended by his doctor.

Applicant has been described as exemplifying excellent character, integrity, and \ndependability, backed by his diligent work ethic. (AE A; AE F) He possesses out-of-the-\nbox thinking. (AE B) He is always attentive to detail, and communicates well. (AE D) He \nis a team-player with a strong work ethic. (AE E) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase;   \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring the period commencing in about March 2008, and continuing until at least \nJanuary 2022, Applicant was both a recreational and medicinal substance abuser, whose \nsubstance of choice was marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. During part of \nthat period, there is some disputed and unverified evidence that he held an active security \nclearance, but in the absence of official documentary confirmation of the actual granting \nof a security clearance, the evidence is insufficient to conclude that he was granted a \nsecurity clearance, despite his sometime beliefs that he had been granted one. He was \nalso a purchaser of marijuana, but that is uncharged misconduct. He initially stated that \nhe had no plans to stop using marijuana, at least until someone at his place of \nemployment tells him it is unacceptable to continue using it, but then changed his mind \nand stated he no intent to use marijuana in the future. He altered his comment again and \nstated that while he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, he might do so if it is \nrecommended by his doctor. Thus, his future intentions are not really convincingly clear. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been established, but 25(f) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but the other mitigating condition does not apply. \nApplicant used marijuana from about March 2008 until about January 2022 \u2013 a period of \nalmost 14 years that purportedly ceased 11 months ago. As noted above, he gave \ninconsistent evolving accounts of his use of marijuana as well as his future intentions \nregarding the use of marijuana. His future intent is not convincingly clear. He offered an \nunverified claim that he no longer associates with other marijuana users. While he has \nseemingly participated in some type of counseling earlier this year, he failed to submit \nany documentation other than a scheduling calendar to specify the actual counseling with \na diagnosis or prognosis. He did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, without any conditions. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Applicant\u2019s unalleged purchases of marijuana will \nbe considered only for the five purposes listed above.  \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \nmarijuana use, the relatively brief period of reported abstinence is considered insufficient \nto conclude that the abstinence will continue, especially after so many altered plans \nregarding the use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana for such a lengthy period, \ndespite the fact that such use was prohibited by both the Federal Government and \ngovernment contractors, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

In fact, the cross-allegation under Guideline E refers only to the allegation \nunder Guideline H that Applicant \u201cused marijuana after having been granted access to \nclassified information.\u201d As noted above, although he denied in his SF 86 ever having been \ngranted a security clearance, he admitted in his Answer to the SOR that he had used \nmarijuana \u201cafter having been granted access to classified information.\u201d During the \nhearing, he retracted that portion of the allegation and denied that he had ever been \ngranted access to classified information. Because of the inconsistency regarding that \nissue, I requested that Department Counsel obtain and submit a JPAS report indicating if \nor when Applicant had been granted a security clearance. No such information was \nsubmitted. In the absence of more conclusive evidence that a security clearance had ever \nbeen granted to Applicant, I have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to support \nany finding that he had been granted one. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 16(e) has not been \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 39-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a developer with his current \nemployer since March 2021. He previously worked for other employers as an \nadministrator or team manager. A 2001 high school graduate, he is two courses short of \nobtaining an associate\u2019s degree. To his credit, Applicant did report his use of marijuana \non his SF 86 and discussed such use much more candidly with the OPM investigator. He \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurportedly ceased using marijuana in January 2022. He received some type of \ncounseling earlier this year. His character references are very supportive of his \napplication for a security clearance. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant presented two different scenarios regarding his history of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. In his SF 86, he claimed because of a physical injury to his foot, in \nMay 2008, he started using marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance \u2013 a hand full \nof times in an attempt to mitigate his injury while avoiding any long-term side effects from \npain medication. He later obtained orthotic inserts and combined with the marijuana he \ncorrected his arch and speeded up his recovery. However, during an interview with an \ninvestigator with OPM, his story changed. What had previously been described as \u201cmaybe \na handful of times\u201d starting in May 2008 for medicinal purposes became \u201chabitually . . . \nonce per week, unknown number of times (in the several hundreds)\u201d for nutritional and \nmedicinal purposes starting in March 2008. He was treated for heal pain on only two \nverified occasions much later in November and December 2020 and prescribed orthotics. \nHe initially stated that he had no plans to stop using marijuana, at least until \nsomeone at his place of employment tells him it is unacceptable to continue using it. He \nclaimed that his supervisor and facility security officer were aware of his current use of \nmarijuana as well as his extensive use of it in the past 13 years, but no one indicated his \nmarijuana use constituted any criminal offense or that it violated any employer \nregulations. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude while Applicant did mitigate his personal conduct concerns, he has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant denied the medical account in \nher SOR response because this debt has been paid in full. (SOR response; Tr. 26-33; \nGE 1-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant and her spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in December 2013. The case was discharged by the bankruptcy court in March \n2014. Applicant stated that the debts that were included in the case totaled about $70,000 \nand were mostly medical accounts. Her spouse was unemployed at that time and suffered \nfrom health complications after their medical insurance had lapsed. In addition, their \nyoungest son got into serious trouble and they had pay significant legal fees to provide \nan attorney for him.

After \ndeducting her monthly expenses from her net monthly income, she is left with a monthly \nnet remainder of about $1,200. Her budget included the student loan monthly payment of \n$288.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of\na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in\nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access\nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations. She had a previous \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and discharge in 2014. In approximately 2017, her finances \nbecame delinquent again. Circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely affected \nher finances, including a loss of income from her spouse during sporadic periods of \nunemployment, his medical issues requiring treatment after their health insurance had \nlapsed, and her youngest son getting into serious trouble and the unforeseen accrual of \nlegal expenses. However, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole \nor in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

I find that Applicant mitigated this SOR allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s income has increased over recent years, and she now carries medical \ninsurance through her employer. Her most recent budget showed that she had a net \nmonthly remainder of $1,200 after paying expenses, to include her estimated monthly \nstudent loan payment beginning in January 2023. Although there is insufficient evidence \nto establish a track record of steady student loan payments, I find Applicant to be credible \nin her on-going efforts to resolve her student loans. She provided documentation dated \nJanuary 2022 that she had successfully rehabilitated her student loans. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. \nI find that Applicant acted in a reasonable and responsible manner when dealing \nwith her financial delinquencies by paying off her medical debt and rehabilitating her \nstudent loans. She has established a workable monthly budget and has not created any \nnew delinquent debt. It is clear that she is committed to repaying all of her outstanding \nstudent loan accounts. I find that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis.

He has a job as an engineer for an aerospace company in the defense industry. He has worked for the same company since about 1988. He had a break in employment beginning in June 2017, when he accepted a voluntary layoff with severance pay, until about January 2021, when he resumed employment with the same company. He has no previous military service. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He married in 1995, and he has two adult children. He and his spouse have lived apart since August 2015. They entered into a mediated property settlement agreement and stipulation in January 2019.

The SF 86 \nis commonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2021 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 8) Thereafter, on December 28, 2021, after reviewing the available information, \nthe DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 28, 2022. He admitted the sole factual \nallegation made in the SOR, and he provided a one-page memorandum in explanation. \nHe also requested a clearance decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn February 17, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it March 10, 2022. \nHis reply to the FORM was received on March 16, 2022, and consists of a brief one-\npage memorandum and six pages of supporting documentation. Those matters are \nmade part of the record as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me May 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance, although he has held a clearance in the past. He has a job as an engineer \nfor an aerospace company in the defense industry. He has worked for the same \ncompany since about 1988. He had a break in employment beginning in June 2017, \nwhen he accepted a voluntary layoff with severance pay, until about January 2021, \nwhen he resumed employment with the same company. He has no previous military \nservice. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He married in 1995, and he has two \nadult children. He and his spouse have lived apart since August 2015. They entered into \na mediated property settlement agreement and stipulation in January 2019. (Exhibit 4) \nThe SOR concerns a single delinquent debt, an unpaid judgment in the amount \nof $45,235 obtained against Applicant by his spouse. (Exhibits 5 and 6) He admitted the \nallegation in his answer to the SOR. It is also established by documentary evidence. \n(Exhibits 3-8) In April 2020, the court awarded a judgment to his spouse in the amount \nof $35,500 representing funds due her from his voluntary investment plan (VIP) held \nwith his employer. The judgment was based on Applicant\u2019s unilateral actions of \nliquidating all funds from his employer\u2019s retirement and VIP accounts resulting in \ninsufficient funds to provide his spouse monies as agreed in the parties\u2019 property \nsettlement agreement. (Exhibit 5 at 2) Per the court order, judgments of $35,500 and \n$6,500 (previously entered in December 2019) were consolidated for a total judgment of \n$42,500. By June 2021, the remaining judgment balance was $45,235. (Exhibit 6) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that the legal settlement \nagreement meeting and the aftermath was an emotional and trying event for him. \nFinancially, it left him with few resources and he was then unemployed due to the layoff. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe used what he had left in his employer accounts to pay living expenses and federal \nincome tax due for tax year 2018 of nearly $20,000, of which his spouse had agreed to \npay half. He stated he paid the balance due and his spouse has not repaid him her half \nof the tax bill. He stated that he has a long history of financial responsibility, and he has \nheld a security clearance in the past without a serious security violation. He also stated \nhe would never compromise his security responsibilities for financial gain. In reply to the \nFORM, given his return to work, he stated that he now has an opportunity to take care \nof the debt. He presented six paystubs from various periods in 2021 showing his wages \nwere garnished in the total amount of about $4,700. (Exhibit A) Otherwise, he did not \npresent documentation showing he had entered into a repayment agreement on the \njudgment or had otherwise made payments on the judgment. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4  Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5  Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials.   \n1  Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a large unpaid judgment \nthat he is unable or unwilling to pay, which is sufficient to raise a security concern under \nGuideline F. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nIt\u2019s obvious that Applicant\u2019s financial problem (e.g., the unpaid judgment) resulted \nfrom a combination of a job layoff and a marital separation. Had Applicant remained \ncontinuously employed, happily married, or both, it is highly unlikely that the financial \nproblem would have occurred. But it did. And so the question is whether Applicant has \ntaken sufficient action to resolve the unpaid judgment owed to his spouse. His wages \nhave been subject to garnishment, but otherwise he has not made voluntary payments \non the debt. Nor has he established a repayment plan in an effort to pay down the debt \nover time. It does not appear he has much enthusiasm or motivation to do so, and \nperhaps that\u2019s understandable given the origin of the debt. Nevertheless, the evidence \ndoes not support a conclusion that Applicant has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. In other words, there is no evidence of a reasonable plan to resolve the \ndebt and concomitant conduct by Applicant. The mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in part, but it is not sufficient to mitigate the security concern stemming from the \nremaining judgment balance of about $45,000. \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. National security eligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

He stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cactive mental health symptoms, interpersonal \nstyle, and greatly heightened vulnerability to stress suggest his conditions could \nnegatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment in safeguarding national \nsecurity information or working in classified settings.\u201d (Id.) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concerns pertaining to psychological \nconditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or\nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No\nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn June 2021, Dr. E., a clinical psychologist, diagnosed Applicant with conditions \nthat may impair his judgment, stability, reliability and trustworthiness. He based his \nopinion on a psychological evaluation, which included a clinical interview, psychological \ntesting, and review of Applicant\u2019s medical records from treating psychiatrists who found \npsychiatric disorders. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 29 sets out conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual \nhas demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for a \ncondition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving \ncounseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual's previous \ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence \nor exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation has \nbeen resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. Although Applicant\u2019s mental health disorders may be controlled with \ntreatment, he did not submit documentation from his treating psychiatrist or another \nqualified mental health professional that he was in compliance with a treatment plan at \nthe time of the June 2021 evaluation. He did not present evidence that he is participating \nin counseling, is amenable to treatment, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional. He did not submit an opinion from a qualified mental \nhealth professional that since June 2021 his psychiatric conditions are resolved or under \ncontrol. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is young man who has experienced \npsychological issues since 2015. Despite years of treatment, he continues to suffer from \nmental health conditions that may interfere with his judgment, trustworthiness, and ability \nto reliably hold a security clearance according to a June 2021 clinical evaluation. At this \ntime, Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the concerns arising under the \nguidelines governing U.S. national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline 1: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant is a 39-year old senior systems administrator with a federal contractor. He currently holds a top secret clearance and eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information, granted in 2014, and he has held various clearances dating back to 2008. He received a bachelor's degree in 2008. He has been married for 15 years and has three children from the marriage. (FORM Item 3.) Applicant served on active duty in the Army National Guard from 2004 through 2015. He deployed overseas in the late summer of 2010. In early 2011, he sustained injuries while deployed in a combat zone and was medically evacuated to Europe. The medical staffed determined he was unable to return to combat. He returned to the United States to undergo surgery. He returned to duty, without a medical board in July 2012.

The evaluating psychologist identified \na number of prognostic indicators, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), multiple Axis 1 \ndisorders, chronic pain, medically unexplained symptoms, poor sleep, and possible \ntendency towards somatization. (FORM Item 6 at 10.) The 2014 psychologist noted his \nsocial support network and encouraged him to seek therapy. (FORM Item 6 at 10.) \nIn 2021, at the CAF\u2019s request, a psychologist evaluated Applicant. This diagnosis \nis alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a: Features of Antisocial Personality Disorder (prominent lack of \nempathy, history of aggression); Unspecified Trauma-Related Disorder (minimal intrusive \nsymptoms, no avoidance); Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition \n(chronic pain); and Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (binges). (FORM Item 4 at 7.) The \npsychologist speculated that the positive prognostic indicators she found, stable family \nlife and quarterly visits with a psychiatrist, may be outweighed by his opioid dependence, \nepisodic alcohol abuse, and indications of an unscrupulous attitude toward truthfulness. \n(FORM Item 4 at 7.) She noted he responded to her emails politely and promptly and took \nthe first available appointment. She identified no signs of anxiety and he responded to \nquestions in a relaxed manner with a clear and logical thought process, often providing \nmore detail than necessary to answer a particular question. (FORM Item 4 at 3.) \nApplicant has been under the care of his current psychiatrist, Doctor T, since 2018. \nHe notes she is treating him for \u201cASPD, PTSD, ADHD, and Chronic Pain Syndrome with \nassociated wave of depression.\u201d (FORM Item 2 at 5.) Doctor T states she has been \ntreating him for persistent issues of anxiety, insomnia, and inattention. She states his \ndiagnosis is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Inattentive type (F90.0), and \nUnspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). She concludes she does not believe he has a \npersonality disorder or an alcohol use disorder. (AE2 at 1.) \nDoctor T addresses each diagnosis from the 2021 evaluation. (AE2 at 1.) She \nstates Applicant lacks all the criteria for an antisocial personality disorder. She notes, \nwhile he does have a sense of detachment from others, these are skills necessary to \ncarry out military orders and to keep himself and others safe. Doctor T cites his support \nnetwork of family and the feelings of warmth towards his wife and children, as well as the \nvalue he places on his professionalism and being part of a team. She identifies as a \nstrength, his ability to detach from his own life and focus on his work and cites favorably \nthe absence of evidence that this trait has ever been brought up as a professional liability. \nDoctor T noted based on her professional experience people working in technical fields, \nsuch as engineering or other professions involving computer programing or job \ndescriptions that require an analytic over an emotional skill set, may demonstrate as \n\u201clower in warmth than others.\u201d (AE 2 at 1.) \nDoctor T addressed the alcohol abuse diagnosis. She cited his medical record and \nher four years of treatment observation. She highlighted the fact that any excessive \nalcohol use was several years ago, when he was experiencing severe insomnia and used \nexcessive alcohol in order to sleep. She found no pattern of problematic alcohol use, \nother than this specific time period. (AE2 at 1.)

(AE 2 at 2.) \nApplicant denied the alcohol allegation, SOR \u00b6 2.a. He acknowledged during the \n2012-2014 time-period he had \u201cused alcohol as a crutch to numb the effects of [his] \nchronic pain, but never while on duty and in the confinements of [his] home.\u201d (FORM Item \n2 at 5.) Given his injuries, he has been treated by an advanced pain therapy clinic and \nrequired to enter into an opioid contract. His pain management doctor, Doctor S, has \ntreated him for 10 years. Doctor S noted he had been compliant with the clinic\u2019s opioid \ntherapy policies and had not demonstrated aberrant behaviors. His urine drug screens \nhave been normal, as have his prescription monitoring reports. (AE3.) \nApplicant emphasizes the fact that the record reflects he has never been accused \nor charged with any violent crimes or any crimes at all. (AE1.) He states the main reason \nhe sought therapy was to make his family happy and safe. (FORM Item 2 at 5 and FORM \nItem 6 at 10.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are applicable: \n(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s complaints have been worked out with a \ncombination of appropriate pharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. His treating \ndoctors state he is compliant with his treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is established. Applicant is voluntarily participating in a treatment \nprogram, receiving counseling and medication. He has been fully compliant with his \ntreatment plan, which includes regular appointments, taking his medications as \nprescribed, and passing urine drug screens. He has allowed his doctors to share his \nmedical records and to communicate with all of his other providers. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is established. He provided recent evidence from a medical \nprofessional regarding his mental and behavioral health. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s complaints have been worked out with a \ncombination of appropriate pharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. There is no \nrecord of incidents of misconduct, workplace issues, or security violations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) or alcohol use disorder. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the Guideline I concerns under Guideline G. Applicant\u2019s \n2021 CAF psychological evaluation is the basis for SOR \u00b6 1.a. In this evaluation, he \nacknowledges binge drinking in the 2012 to 2014 time period. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies. He \nwas diagnosed with a mild alcohol use disorder during this evaluation. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies \nto that diagnosis. SOR \u00b6 1.b does not allege alcohol consumption. The part of SOR \u00b6 2.a \nthat cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program.  \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established.

Applicant acknowledges the period in question and \nprovided statements from his treating doctors showing he has overcome this problem. \nThe fact he is tested regularly for substances and has had no incidents demonstrates a \nclear and established pattern of modified consumption in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) is established. Applicant has been participating in mental health \ncounseling and subject to substance abuse monitoring for almost ten years. His \npsychiatrist, Doctor T, found no pattern of problem alcohol use other than during the one \nspecific time period. She concludes his statements about limited use of alcohol are \naccurate because he has no alcohol-related arrests or medical issues that would cause \nalcohol to be diagnosed as a clinical concern. Additionally, she notes he has never failed \na drug screen and has been taking controlled medications as part of his regimen for many \nyears. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I and G in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nThe written record supports his actions and statements. He held a security clearance \nduring his active duty service, apparently without incident. He has 10 years of \ndocumented successful treatment from the doctor monitoring his medications and his \ntreating psychiatrist for the past four years concluded he does not have a personality \ndisorder or alcohol abuse disorder. Finally, the absence of any negative incident in the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord is compelling and reflects his compliance with his program of pharmacotherapy \nand supportive psychotherapy. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I and \nG, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas met his burden to establish he has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \npsychological conditions and alcohol consumption. Eligibility for continued access to \nclassified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n Subparagraph 2.a: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 1) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the CAF did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.

(Id.) \nThe FORM indicated the mortgage debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was mitigated. (FORM at 3) \nHowever, his history of handling his other three loans warranted denial of his security \nclearance. (FORM at 4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is. well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced unemployment and illness which were circumstances \nbeyond his control, and they adversely affected his finances. However, \u201c[e]ven if \napplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with several of his creditors or that he made offers to \nmake partial payments to them for several years. \nApplicant is credited with paying and mitigating the mortgage debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in \n2019. He attempted to establish payment plans for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c; \nhowever, the two creditors wanted a lump sum payment to resolve the three debts. The \nthree accounts were closed and charged off without being paid. After he sold his house \nin 2019, he contacted the creditors and collection agents, and they refused to reopen the \naccounts. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s latest credit report does not indicate any delinquent accounts.

June 28, 2021) (\u201cResolution of a delinquent debt does \nnot preclude further inquiry or examination regarding it. Even if an alleged debt has been \npaid or canceled, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debt as \nwell as any previous actions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal about the \napplicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance\u201d) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 17, 2017)); ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (Aug. 25, 2015) (\u201cIndeed, even if a credit \nreport states that a debt has been paid, that fact alone does not, in and of itself, resolve \nconcerns arising from the dilatory nature of an applicant\u2019s response to his debts or other \ncircumstances that detract from an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability\u201d). \nIn 2014, Applicant left his position with a DOD contractor because of health issues. \nThe VA determined he was 100 percent disabled. He was unable to maintain all of his \naccounts using his VA disability payments and Air Force retirement pay. Once he \nobtained employment he attempted to pay his creditors. He paid one debt in 2019. The \ncreditors for the other three accounts declined his payment proposals and charged off the \ndebts. There is no reason to doubt his statements about attempting to pay his creditors. \nBased on his most recent credit report, there is sufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are resolved. Under all the circumstances, he established mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 7, 2020 (April \n2020 SCA). On December 8, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 23, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

She received the \nFORM on April 21, 2022, but did not respond to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2022. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 through 4 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 5 through 10 are \nadmitted into evidence. Although Item 10 was not authenticated as required by Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.20, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 10. The Government \nincluded in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 10 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if she did not raise an objection to Item 10 in her response to the FORM, or \nif she did not respond to the FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 10 could be considered as evidence in her case. \nProcedural Matter \nApplicant apparently submitted an SCA prior to the April 2020 SCA, as indicated \nduring her background investigation. She was interviewed during her background \ninvestigation on February 5, 2020 (Interview 1), February 26, 2020 (Interview 2), and \nFebruary 28, 2020 (Interview 3). She discussed information apparently from the prior SCA \nduring Interviews 1 and 3. Because it was not proffered by the Government or otherwise \nincluded in the record, I have neither reviewed nor considered the prior SCA. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 42, is a single mother of two adult children and one minor child. Her \ntwo youngest children reside with her. She attended college between 2007 and 2011, but \ndid not earn a degree. She has been employed as a material handler by a defense \ncontractor since January 2020. This is her first application for a security clearance. (Item \n5) \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts totaling $16,166, each of which were \nconfirmed by credit reports from 2020 and 2021. In her Answer, Applicant admitted each\ndebt, with explanations in support of mitigation. With respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c,\n1.e through 1.h and 1.l, she stated that she was working on a \u201ccredit repair.\u201d Concerning\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.o, she stated that they were included in a 2013 Chapter 13\nbankruptcy.

However, \nduring Interview 3, she revealed that she had been unemployed from November 1, 2019 \nthrough November 15, 2019. She left her prior employer at the end of October 2019 to \nfind a shorter commute to work. She was supported by her savings during that period of \nunemployment while she searched for a new job. She worked primarily in retail jobs from \n2009 until she began working with a defense contractor in January 2020. (Items 5, 10) \nApplicant disclosed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on her April 2020 SCA and reported \nthat it was initially filed in June 2013, refiled in January 2014 (due to a clerical error), and \nthen discharged in December 2018. She stated: \u201cFiling chapter 13 allowed me to pay \nall/portion of my debt.\u201d She also disclosed that she voluntarily surrendered a vehicle for \nrepossession in about September 2019 to resolve a $5,600 debt. During Interview 1, she \nattributed her bankruptcy filing to a combination of her pregnancy with her youngest child \nand an employer cutting back her work hours. That employer changed its policy and \nrequired everyone to reduce hours to part-time except for managers (which she was not). \nWhile the record did not specify the period when her hours were reduced, Applicant \nindicated that it began around the time when she was pregnant with her youngest child. \nOn the April 2020 SCA, Applicant reported that her youngest child was born in 2010 and \nthat she worked for said employer from October 2009 through June 2013. The record did \nnot otherwise specify her income history. (Items 5, 10) \nDuring Interview 1, Applicant explained that she was not behind in her payments \nfor the vehicle reported in the April 2020 SCA. She decided to voluntarily surrender the \nvehicle to the creditor when she realized that she could not afford to keep up with the \npayments ($265/bi-weekly) due to cost of repairs and gas. At the time of the surrender, \nthe creditor told her that she might owe a deficiency balance. However, she had not \nreceived anything from the creditor since the surrender. This debt was reported in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i. After the surrender, she purchased another vehicle with a lower monthly payment, \nsaving her $110 per month. Her 2021 credit report corroborated that her current car loan \nwas in good standing. The record did not otherwise specify her expense history. She \ndescribed her then financial situation as decent. She did not expect to incur any additional \ndelinquent debts because she had begun reading books on repairing credit, created a \nbudget, and reduced her car payment. (Item 6, 10) \nLater during Interview 1, Applicant was confronted with delinquent debts that were \nnot reported on her April 2020 SCA. She did not believe that she needed to list the specific \ndebts included in her bankruptcy. She denied any knowledge of other debts that had not \nbeen included in the bankruptcy, but stated that she would be willing to pay them if it was \ndetermined that she owed them. She did not address what, if any, steps she would take \nto investigate the unknown debts. She maintained that she did not possess any \ndocuments concerning her finances. (Item 10) \nDuring Interview 2, Applicant volunteered that she was working on repairing her \ncredit. She also purchased a book titled \u201cBy the Book Credit Repair\u201d to assist in those \nefforts. Upon investigation, she learned that one of the debts that she had previously \nidentified as a medical bill during Interview 1 was actually a mortgage loan. However, the \nSOR and credit reports indicate that the debt was not a mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.m), but \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na childcare expense. She also reiterated that the federal student loan accounts discussed \nduring Interview 1 were in forbearance status and no longer past due (which was \ncorroborated by her November 2021 CBR). She did not discuss her delinquent debts \nduring Interview 3. (Items 6, 10) \nThe Government provided a copy of the bankruptcy petition filed by Applicant and \nthe court\u2019s docket sheet of the bankruptcy proceedings. According to those documents, \nthe petition was filed in February 2014. The Chapter 13 plan was filed in February 2014 \nand confirmed in May 2014. Neither the terms of the plan nor any plan payments made \nby Applicant were indicated in the record. In November 2017, the trustee filed a motion \nto dismiss (MTD) for failure to make plan payments. A certificate of service for the MTD \nwas filed in June 2018. In November 2018, the court entered an order of default granting \nthe MTD. The case was closed in January 2019. The docket sheet listed the \u201cdebtor \ndisposition\u201d as \u201cDismissed for failure to make plan payments.\u201d (Item 9) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Appellant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). There was insufficient evidence in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe record to establish AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability \nto do so). \nI considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Government presented a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline \nF. Accordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. She failed to do so. \nAlthough Applicant raised the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions cited \nabove, she produced no documentation or other corroborating information to support any \nof them. Her attempt to resolve debts through bankruptcy could be considered an \nacceptable form of debt resolution. However, the record did not reflect any plan payments \nmade pursuant to the bankruptcy plan or that the bankruptcy debts were successfully \ndischarged. Based on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the Guideline F concerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He has been employed as a field service representative by the defense contractor sponsoring his SCA since November 2019. He was previously granted a DOD security clearance on a date not indicated in the record. (Item 3) The SOR alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $48,688, including five federal student loans totaling $38,634. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the alleged debts. His admitted debts totaled $45,588. Each of the SOR allegations were also confirmed by his May and December 2021 credit reports.

On \nDecember 16, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 23, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Although Item 7 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, \nI conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 7. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 7 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 7 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n7 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, divorced his wife of three years in 2019. They separated in 2017. \nThey share custody of two children, ages 7 and 8. Although it was not court ordered, they \nagreed that Applicant would pay $800 per month for child support. (Item 3; Item 7) \nApplicant served on active duty as an enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force from \n2012 until 2017, and then as an inactive reservist until 2019. He received his high school \ndiploma in 2006, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer electronics engineering technology \nin about January 2020. He has been employed as a field service representative by the \ndefense contractor sponsoring his SCA since November 2019. He was previously granted \na DOD security clearance on a date not indicated in the record. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 10 delinquent debts totaling $48,688, including five federal \nstudent loans totaling $38,634. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the alleged \ndebts. His admitted debts totaled $45,588. Each of the SOR allegations were also \nconfirmed by his May and December 2021 credit reports. (Items 5-6) \nApplicant took out the aforementioned student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g) to \npay for his bachelor\u2019s degree. The May 2021 credit report shows the date the loans were \nopened as: July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), December 2007 (SOR 1.d), July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), \nApril 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). During his June 2021 security \nclearance interview (SI), he stated that he attended university from September 2006 \nthrough January 2020. He also averred that after graduation, he was able to obtain \ndeferments two times. He was not able to provide the dates of the deferments or the \namount of the loans at the time of the deferments. Information in his credit reports indicate \nthe loans have been in delinquent status since about June 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and July \n2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g). The record did not address these discrepancies. (Item 5 \nat 4-5; Item 6 at 2-7; Item 7 at 3) \nApplicant contacted the collection agent for his student loans on the morning of his \nSI and was offered a repayment plan. He maintained that he could not afford the $330 \nper month required of that plan, but intended to contact the agent again after his SI to try \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \nto negotiate the monthly payment down to $200, which was an amount he maintained \nthat he could afford to pay. He attributed his delay in contacting the collection agent to his \nbelief that his loans were in forbearance. In his Answer, Applicant asserted that he was \nresolving the student loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g through an income-based \nrepayment plan. However, he did not provide any corroborating documents. (Item 2; Item \n7 at 3-4) \nApplicant did not assert that his student loans were subject to the current \nemergency relief available for federal student loans, nor did the statements he made \nduring his SI and in his Answer indicate such. However, I sua sponte took administrative \nnotice of the fact that, beginning March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nU.S. Department of Education has been providing emergency relief for federal student \nloans, including the suspension of loan payments and collections on defaulted loans. On \nApril 6, 2022, President Biden extended that COVID-19 relief through August 31, 2022.1  \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($100) on the basis that it is unknown to \nhim. Despite his research, he has not found a way to contact the creditor to confirm the \ndebt. In his Answer, he stated that had \u201cdisputed this account.\u201d The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nappeared on his May 2021 credit report, but not his December 2021 credit report. (Items \n2, 4, 5) \nApplicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($81) and intends to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b ($1,125), 1.h ($2,992), and 1.i ($5,756) once he refinances his home mortgage. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is related to a military exchange credit-card account. The debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are related to two consolidation loans he took out to pay off car loans. He \nused the first one in September 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) to pay off the remaining balance of \nTruck A. He financed the $42,000 purchase of Truck A in 2015 with a $572 monthly \npayment. After about a year, he realized that he could no longer afford the payments so \nhe sold Truck A leaving a remaining balance of about $10,000, which was charged off by \nthe bank. The record did not indicate why the reported balance due is $5,756 given that \nApplicant has not made any payments on the account since it was charged off. He used \nthe second consolidation loan in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) to pay off a $2,992 deficiency \nbalance remaining after Truck B was repossessed due to nonpayment in 2017 or 2018. \nDuring his SI, he acknowledged that he had never contacted the creditors about the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h or 1.i. In his Answer, he asserted that he was \u201cin the process of \nrefinancing [his] home in order to get all my account [sic] back into good standing,\u201d and \n\u201cworking to set up a repayment plan\u201d to resolve the debt in \u00b6 SOR 1.b. (Items 2, 5, 6; Item \n7 at 5) \nDuring his SI, Applicant disclosed a third vehicle that had been repossessed in \n2018 due to nonpayment. He financed the $20,900 purchase of this vehicle in 2016 with \na $350 monthly payment.

He asserted that, once \nthey separated (on a date not indicated in the record), he was \u201cforced to take on all the \nfinancial burden and simply could not do it alone.\u201d In his Answer, he maintained that \u201cI\u2019m \nactively trying to resolve financial conflicts the best and most efficient way I can . . . .\u201d \n(Item 2; Item 7 at 3) \nApplicant sought help from a debt relief company in about 2020 to assist him with \nresolving his debts. However, he was unable to recall any details about their agreement, \nincluding which debts were involved, the amount he paid the company each month, and \nthe extent to which the company assisted him with his debts. He was not certain for how \nlong he worked with the company, but estimated about one year. He asserted that he \nstopped working with them because he could no longer afford the monthly payments. He \ndid not indicate whether the company provided him with any financial counseling. (Item 7 \nat 4) \nApplicant also attributed his financial situation to other factors in addition to his \nseparation and divorce, including his own financial irresponsibility. In his SCA, he reported \nthat his 2018 DWI conviction negatively impacted his finances. During his SI, he explained \nthat he fell behind on his mortgage payments following the DWI. He was able to bring the \nmortgage current through a loan modification. He has prioritized paying expenses \nassociated with the care of his children, including a keeping a roof over their heads, gas \nin the car for transportation to get them to daycare and him to work, and paying for food \nand utilities.

An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nI find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j in Applicant\u2019s favor. AG \u00b6 20(e) is established as to SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. and AG \u00b6 20(d) is established as to SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nThe record indicates that Applicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent prior to his \nreported graduation in 2020. Although his statements suggest otherwise, his loans appear \nto qualify for the COVID-19 emergency relief extended through August 2022. However, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe extent to which his loans may be entitled this relief does not suffice to mitigate \nconcerns surrounding his nonpayment since they initially became delinquent in June 2019 \nand July 2019. He did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate his pre-pandemic \nefforts to resolve them. Accordingly, his loans underscore the ongoing concern \nsurrounding his history of indebtedness. \nThe unresolved non-student loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i total $9,873. \nUndoubtedly his separation and divorce negatively impacted his finances and AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis partially established. However, he acknowledged that other factors also underlay his \naccumulation of delinquent debts. The record lacked sufficient detail for me to conclude \nthat his debts have persisted largely due to circumstances beyond his control, or that he \nacted responsibly to resolve his debts. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. \nApplicant is credited with successfully modifying his mortgage loan following his \nDWI-related default, and with resolving one of his three auto loan debts. Moreover, the \nfact that he has not accumulated any new delinquent debts weighs in his favor. However, \nwith respect to the SOR debts, the record reflects that he paid only one $81 debt. I \nconsidered that he is not required to be debt-free in order to merit a favorable \ndetermination about his eligibility for access to classified information. Without a \nmeaningful track record of regular and timely payments to his creditors, I am unable to \nconclude that he will follow through with his plans to resolve his delinquent debts or that \nhis indebtedness is unlikely to recur. While he may be able to overcome the security \nconcerns at some future date, based on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that \nAppellant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and \n(e) have not been established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.i.  \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his unresolved debts.

(Item 2; Item 4; Item 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $109,000 in delinquent consumer debt. He incurred this debt, \nin part, to help his adult son\u2019s family financially. Applicant stopped paying the alleged \ndelinquent debts in 2019 at the direction of the debt consolidation company he hired in \napproximately May 2019. According to him, he paid $1,100 monthly for approximately \none year to this company until it stopped accepting his payments and responding to his \ninquiries. The company later went out of business. He provided no documentation of proof \nof these payments. Nor has he provided any evidence that he has contacted any of \ncreditors of the SOR debts to establish any other payment arrangements or accept the \nsettlement offers that several of his creditors offered him. \nThe six alleged debts remain outstanding and unpaid; therefore, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgement. \nAdditionally, there is limited record evidence that the circumstances in which these debts \noccurred were beyond his control. He chose to provide significant financial assistance to \nhis adult son, his daughter-in-law, and her two children, despite their apparent lack of \nability or desire to repay him or pay their joint obligation. Additionally, once the debt \nconsolidation company went out of business in mid-2020, Applicant did not make any \nefforts to continue making payments to the creditors of the SOR allegations. The totality \nof the evidence does not demonstrate he acted responsibly toward his financial \nobligations that he entered into willingly. Nor has he provided evidence of a good-faith \neffort to repay or resolve his delinquent debts. The record lacks proof of any payments to \neither his creditors or to the debt consolidation company. Finally, he provided very limited \ninformation from the debt consolidation company; therefore, there is a lack of evidence \nthat Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the alleged debts. For the forgoing \nreasons, Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career as a defense contractor and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant \ntook two personal loans out with this loan company in approximately 2013, after his \ndivorce, to help repair his ex-wife\u2019s vehicle. His ex-wife had agreed to pay him back, but \nfailed to do so. Applicant stated that he was unsuccessful in negotiating a settlement \nwith the creditor. This debt is included in his DCP.

This is the second of two loans with same creditor listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e, infra. This debt is not included in Applicant\u2019s DCP. In 2016, Applicant stated that \nhe requested the Department of Education (DoED) to place his education loans in \nforbearance while he was deployed outside of the United States, \u201cbecause it would be \ndifficult for him to make the payments while deployed.\u201d Applicant has two student loan \ncollection accounts with DoED that are alleged in his SOR. See SOR \u00b6 1.e, infra. In \nJanuary 2017, Applicant called DoED and was informed that his loans had not been \nplaced in forbearance, but had been placed in collections.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Sept. 24, 2013). \nIn summary, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of his adult life, and he is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting his long-standing financial problems are being appropriately addressed, \ndoubts remain about his suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the \nnational interest is the principal focus of these adjudications. According, those doubts \nmust be resolved against Applicant. \nWhile some of the debts alleged in the SOR arguably resulted from \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control due to his 2014 divorce, that is only half of the \nanalysis and Applicant\u2019s response to his financial problems must be the second \nconsideration. Applicant discussed the importance of maintaining his clearance and how \nlosing his clearance will impact his employability. He also mentioned his past history of \nholding a Top Secret security clearance when serving on submarine duty while he was \non active duty. Applicant\u2019s clearance history and the awareness of the adverse \nconsequences clearance loss would have on his future employment should been \nenough motivation for him to realize that his clearance was in jeopardy if he did not \nresponsibly address his financial situation. \nTo recap, the majority of Applicant\u2019s debts stem from his 2014 divorce. His OPM \nPSI took place on November 24, 2020. During that interview, the investigator discussed \nApplicant\u2019s debts in detail with him and Applicant assured the investigator that he would \nfollow up by taking corrective action. On November 24, 2021, DOHA issued Applicant \nhis SOR identifying outstanding debts that raised security concerns. On February 2, \n2022, Applicant entered into a relationship with a DCC. Applicant also stated in his \nFORM response that he is doing everything possible and will do everything possible to \naddress his indebtedness. However, these assurances ring hollow in light of Applicant\u2019s \ndocumented history of financial irresponsibility. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding his past efforts to address his outstanding delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture.

Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to nine separate creditors for delinquent accounts totaling in excess of $113,000, which include collections, charge offs, and vehicle repossessions. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 25, 2021; March 16, 2022; and June 1, 2022, confirm this indebtedness.

In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations \nset forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 25, 2021; March 16, \n2022; and June 1, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) \nApplicant testified that until COVID 19 and its aftermath, he paid his bills on time \nand had no financial problems. His financial problems began in January or February \n2020. His employer downsized due to COVID 19. He lost his job and had to go on \nunemployment. \nHis salary to support his family went from $90,000 annually to \nunemployment benefits. Two weeks after he lost his job, his wife was laid off from her \njob. This had a huge impact on his family. For about six or seven months, Applicant \nand his wife supported their family on unemployment benefits. This included making \ntheir mortgage payment, and paying the necessities to survive. Many bills became \ndelinquent. \nApplicant explained that he grew up in a family that bought and sold cars as a \nhobby, and used it as a way of making extra money to support the family. Applicant \nchose exotic cars or cars he knew were underpriced, but highly desirable. He would fix \nthem up, added a special attraction to make them original, (for example, enhancing the \nstereo system, changing the wheels), and then flipped them. (Tr. p. 25.)  Sometimes he \nmade as much as a $10,000 profit on one sale. On average, he earned about $30,000 \na year selling cars this way. \n(Tr. p. 30.) \nApplicant learned the craft from his \ngrandfather, and father who used to do the same thing.  When Applicant lost his job, he \ncould not make the payments on several of the cars he had purchased and they were \nrepossessed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \nApplicant knew that once he went back to work, he could pull equity out of his \nhouse, which he knew to be about $400,000, and he could easily pay off his delinquent \ndebt with it. This is exactly what he did. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in April 2021. He earns about \n$120,000 annually. (Tr. p. 73.) To resolve his indebtedness, in November 2021, he \napplied for and obtained a home equity loan in the amount of $65,000, that he used to \npay his delinquent debts. \nIn January 2022, he refinanced his house and pulled \n$88,000, that he used to pay off his remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. pp. 80-81.) On \nJanuary 17, 2022, Applicant paid off all of the debts set forth in the SOR. \nThe following delinquent debts were of security concern: \n1.a.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $26,875. This was his wife\u2019s Lincoln Continental. Applicant \npurchased it between 2018 and 2019. He spent $80,000 on the car, with monthly \npayment of $1,200. When he became unemployed, he could no longer afford to make \nthe car payments. The car was voluntarily repossessed. The account was settled for \n60% of what was owed. Applicant paid $16,125 to resolve the debt. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A, Tr. p. 26-27, and 36, and 53.)  \n1.b. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $3,811. This was a credit card that Applicant \nco-signed for his daughter. Applicant provided a copy of a Satisfaction of Judgement \nand related documents showing that the debt has been paid. Applicant has resolved \nthe debt. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and F, and Tr. p. 39.) \n1.c. \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor for account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $3,321. This was a credit card. Documentation \nto substantiate payment of the debt is set forth in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B. Applicant has \nresolved the debt. (Tr. p. 40.) \n1.d. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $1,884. This was a cellular phone bill from T-\nMobile. Documentation to substantiate payment of this debt is set forth in Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit D.  Applicant has resolved the debt.  (Tr. p. 40-41.) \n1.e. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $1,302. \nThis was a Kia that was \u201ca lemon\u201d and was \nreturned to the dealer. The deficiency when they sold it was owed by the Applicant. \nDocumentation to substantiate payment of this debt is set forth in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E. \nApplicant has resolved the debt. (Tr. pp. 46-47.) \n1.f. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed \nfor collection in the approximate amount of $820. This was a co-pay for an emergency \nroom visit. Applicant has paid the debt in full.

This is for the purchase of Applicant\u2019s F-150 truck. \nApplicant was sued by Ford Motor Company for breach of contract when he could no \nlonger afford to make payments on the account. The account was settled for $21,000. \nDocumentation to substantiate payment of this debt is set forth in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G. \nApplicant has resolved this debt. \n1.h. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the amount of $19,177. This is for the purchase of a Hyundai Santa Fe \nSUV, a vehicle that Applicant purchased for his son who has a special needs child. The \naccount was settled for $15,340. Documentation to substantiate payment of this debt is \nset forth in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H. \n1.i. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was past due in the \namount of $4,725, with a total balance of $34,692. This is for the purchase of a Kia \nHyundai. \nThe account was settled for $24,600. \nDocumentation to substantiate \npayment of this debt is set forth in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to COVID 19 and its devastating impact on society, Applicant and his wife \nlost their jobs and were on unemployment for six or seven months which caused serious \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial hardships for their household. Many of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent \nas he was unable to pay his bills. His actions or inactions both demonstrated a history \nof not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has gone back to work. He has obtained a line of credit on his house, \nrefinanced his house, recently sold it, and then purchased another home in order to get \nhis finances back in top order. He understands the importance of being responsible and \ntrustworthy in every aspect of his life, including his finances. He has paid off all of his \ndelinquent debts. He is current with all of his regular monthly expenses. He is living \nwithin his means and he intends to continue to do so. He understands that his hobby of \nselling and buying cars may be too risky to continue in an unstable environment like \nCOVID, and it may be a thing of the past. He understands the great responsibilities \nattached with holding a security clearance, and the many sacrifices one must make to \nhold the privilege. Now that he is back to work, Applicant is now following a financial \nbudget and has modified his spending habits to be consistently financially responsible. \nApplicant has demonstrated responsibility and good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  Mitigating conditions 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are applicable. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved.

The case was assigned \nto me on March 17, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing on March 21, 2022. The hearing was convened as scheduled via \nTEAMS between the United States and Foreign Country (FC) on April 6, 2022. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2022. Applicant requested the record remain open for receipt of \nadditional information. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits A through D in a timely \nfashion, which were also admitted without objection. The record then closed. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant is 33 years old and married with three children. He has a high school \neducation and has been employed by a defense contractor since November 2020 in a \nFC. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. He also submitted additional information \nto support the granting of national security eligibility. \nThe Government alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR that Applicant had not filed \nhis 2017, 2018, or 2019 Federal tax returns. Paragraph 2 of the SOR alleged that \nApplicant had not filed his 2017, 2018, or 2019 State A tax returns. \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. He was also a citizen of FC because \nhis mother is a citizen of FC, where she currently lives. He lived in the United States until \nDecember 2017, when he moved to FC for better employment opportunities and to be \nclose to his family. Applicant worked for different FC firms from January 2018 until \nNovember 2020, when he began working for his current employer. During the period he \nwas employed by FC firms Applicant was paid in the local currency. (Tr. 14; Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 13A.) \nApplicant admits that he was at fault for not filing his 2017 Federal and State A tax \nreturns in a timely fashion. He further stated that he did not know he was required to file \nFederal tax returns for 2018 and 2019. He thought that since he was employed in FC, \nwas a dual citizen of FC, and was paid in local currency, he did not have to file tax returns. \nApplicant eventually determined that his belief was in error.

See Internal Revenue Service, Publication 54, \nTax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad, https://www.irs.gov/forms-\npubs/about-publication-54 (accessed September 21, 2022). The maximum Foreign \nEarned Income Exclusion rose from $104,100 in 2018 to $107,600 in 2020. According to \nApplicant this exclusion would have covered all of his income from his FC employers. \nSuch a situation does not, however, obviate the requirement to timely file a tax return \nevery year. Applicant stated that he simply did not know of this requirement, (Tr. 23-24; \nGovernment Exhibit 3 at 13.) \nApplicant did not have access to tax forms for tax year 2017 until recently. He \naccessed his W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for 2017 from the IRS website on December \n4, 2021. He testified that he prepared and mailed his Federal tax returns for 2017 through \n2019 to the Austin, Texas IRS service center on February 8, 2022, which were received \non February 28, 2022. He did not report any income for 2018 or 2019 on his Federal tax \nforms because he believed income earned overseas in a foreign currency was exempt. \nHe did not present any evidence supporting that statement. Applicant did not retain copies \nof these tax returns. As of the date the record closed Applicant had not received any \nresponse from the IRS as to whether his returns were correct or processed. (Tr. 16-17, \n23-26, 38; Government Exhibit 3 at 5-12.) \nApplicant had issues getting his State A tax returns to the proper office. It appears \nthat he has now sent them to the proper address on April 20, 2022. (Tr. 20-21; Applicant \nExhibits A at 1-2 and D at 6.) \nApplicant forwarded a copy of his State A tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019 \nthat were prepared by him. They properly show that he was no longer a resident of State \nA in 2018 or 2019. The 2017 form submitted to me is incomplete. The form shows \nApplicant owed $2,224 in taxes. However, there is no information that Applicant has \nactually made arrangements to pay the taxes. Therefore, based on this record, I cannot \nfind that he has successfully filed his 2017 State A tax return. (Tr. 26-28; Applicant Exhibit \nC.) \nApplicant appeared to have retained a tax service firm on April 7, 2022, to file his \n2017, 2018, and 2019 tax returns. No further information was received as to whether the \nfirm has actually filed any of Applicant\u2019s Federal or State A tax returns for the subject \nyears. (Applicant Exhibit A at 2.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a recent performance review from his supervisor, which stated \nhe meets or exceeds expectations in every area.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2017 through 2019. He failed to timely file his State A income tax return for tax year 2017. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying condition and \nshifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his 2017 Federal and State A tax returns \ndue to his own dilatory conduct. With regard to 2018 and 2019 tax returns there was \nconfusion over the requirement to do so since he lived and worked overseas as an FC \ncitizen. There was no requirement to file State A tax returns for 2018 and 2019 because \nhe was no longer a resident. It appears that Applicant may have submitted all the subject \ntax returns to both the IRS and State A. However, there is little to no evidence that he has \nfiled them properly. As stated above, his 2017 State A tax return was incomplete since it \nwas missing essential payment information. As of the date the record closed he had \nreceived no information from the IRS as to his tax status for 2017, 2018, or 2019.

Therefore, it appears that Applicant is not sure he has filed all the subject \nreturns correctly. At the present time Applicant has not submitted sufficient mitigation to \novercome the adverse inference of his tax situation. Guideline F is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not provided \nsufficient evidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur \nin the future. If Applicant is able to resolve his tax issues with the IRS and State A he may \nbe eligible for national security eligibility in the future. The potential for pressure, \nexploitation, or duress has not been resolved at the present time. Overall, the evidence \ndoes create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guideline for financial considerations at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He was employed in the civilian sector before being hired by his current \nemployer. He has held a security clearance since about 2017. (Tr. 16.) \nApplicant married in May 2003 and has three children, ages 12, 8, and 5. He \nattended a community college from August 1999 to May 2013 and received a general \nstudies degree in May 2014. He attended a technical school from June to September \n2014 and received a certificate in September 2014. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana twice, in \nJanuary and February 2021. (GX 1 at 30-31.) During an interview with a security \ninvestigator in July 2021, he told the investigator that he obtained marijuana from a friend \nand used it on one occasion with his wife and a second occasion with his brother and \nsister-in-law. When asked about his motivation for using it, he explained that he knew that \nmarijuana use was about to be decriminalized in July 2021 in the state where he resides, \nand he \u201cjust wanted to try it out.\u201d He told the investigator that future use of marijuana was \n\u201cprobable,\u201d but that he felt no need to use it. He told the investigator that he wanted to \nkeep his options open because marijuana was legal in the state where he resides. (GX 2 \nat 5.) In response to DOHA interrogatories about his intention to use marijuana in the \nfuture, he responded, \u201cMaybe, no real plans to.\u201d (GX 2 at 11.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that when he used marijuana on two occasions, \nhe was not aware that it might affect his security clearance. His employer\u2019s policy \nregarding marijuana use is to send an employee to rehabilitation classes for the first use, \nand any subsequent use is grounds for termination. He believed that his employer\u2019s policy \nwas a \u201cgray area,\u201d similar to alcohol abuse. (Tr. 17-19.) \nApplicant testified that he obtained the marijuana from a friend, that he had used \nall of it, and that he is \u201ctoo cheap\u201d to buy any more. (Tr. 21.)

(Tr. 21-22.) He was asked, \u201cIf you have a choice between your job and \nmarijuana, which one are you going to take?\u201d He responded, \u201cAbsolutely my job.\u201d (Tr. 26.) \nAfter the hearing, he submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \nuse, acknowledging that any future involvement would result in revocation of his security \nclearance. His statement was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn October 2014, the then-Director of National Intelligence (DNI), issued a \nmemorandum addressing changes in state laws relating to marijuana. He reminded \nagency heads that \u201cchanges to state laws . . . pertaining to marijuana use do not later the \nexisting National Security Adjudicative guidelines.\u201d He wrote, \u201cAn individual's disregard of \nfederal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security determinations.\u201d Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (Oct. 25, 2014). \nApplicant was aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy. He knew that the first illegal \ndrug use would result in referral for treatment and the second illegal use could result in \ntermination. His admissions are sufficient to raise the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent but infrequent. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis drug use when he submitted his SCA. His responses to questions about future drug \nuse were ambiguous when he was interviewed by a security investigator and when he \nresponded to the SOR. The security investigator\u2019s admonition to be open and truthful \napparently made an impression on him and caused him to qualify his answers about \nfuture drug use, knowing that the laws regarding marijuana might change in the future. \nHowever, he acknowledged at the hearing that he has no desire to trigger the adjudication \nprocess again and risk losing his job again by any future marijuana involvement. He is \nnot likely to disassociate from his wife and brother, with whom he smoked marijuana, but \nhe submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and \nacknowledged that any future involvement would result in revocation of his security \nclearance and loss of his job.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(3) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant\u2019s na\u00efve attitude about trying out marijuana while holding a \nclearance and knowing that he was violating federal law is cause for concern, considering \nhis age and work experience. However, he is a product of his generation, unconvinced \nthat recreational use of marijuana should be illegal and equating it to alcohol use. \nNevertheless, his experience of finding his continued employment at risk appears to have \ngained his attention. To his credit, he was candid and open when he submitted his SCA, \nduring security interviews, and at the hearing. He has voluntarily placed himself on \nprobation by submitting his statement of intent. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his illegal drug use. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He served on active \nduty with the U.S. Navy from 2002 to August 2017 and received an honorable \ndischarge. (Items 3, 4) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts totaling \nabout $53,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthese debts with additional comment. The Guideline F SOR allegations are established \nthrough Applicant\u2019s admissions, his entries in his SF 8\n 6, and the credit reports produced \nby the Government. The home improvement loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a appears in the 2020, \n2021, and 2022 credit reports and reflects a last payment date of January 2019. The \npersonal loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b appears in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports and \nreflects a last payment date of December 2018. He provided no documentary evidence \nto show that either of these debts were paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1-\n6, 11) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his most recent divorce and the \nfinancial burden of his child and spousal support payments. He claimed that he is \npaying about $2,400 per month for child support, spousal support, and to repay benefits \nreceived from the state. He pays about $160 per month for half of a $2,500 personal \nloan that he and his ex-wife obtained prior to their divorce. He also attributed his \nfinancial problems to his and his latest ex-wife\u2019s poor financial planning and poor \nspending habits. Additionally, he claimed that damages to his home from a fire that \nwere not covered by his homeowner\u2019s insurance caused him financial problems, most \nspecifically with the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so \nmore recent information about his finances is not available. (Items 1, 3, 4-6, 11) \nIn April 2018, Applicant was arrested at his home after a physical altercation with \nhis 14-year-old stepson. The two argued about his stepson completing his chores and \nthe argument turned physical. Applicant claimed that he hit his stepson in the shoulder \nand then wrestled him to the ground to subdue him. Applicant\u2019s stepson claimed that \nduring the physical altercation, he was unable to breathe, but Applicant denied that he \nchoked him. Applicant\u2019s spouse called the police. The police arrested Applicant, and \ncharged him with felony risk of injury to a child, misdemeanor strangulation or \nsuffocation in the third degree, and misdemeanor breach of peace in the second \ndegree. He pleaded not guilty and was released, but was ordered to have no contact \nwith his spouse and stepson. As a result of this incident, he attended mental health \ncounseling from April 2018 until August 2018. The record is equivocal on whether he \nvoluntarily attended counseling or it was court ordered. He also voluntarily took anger \nmanagement therapy from June 2018 until September 2018. He claimed that as a result \nof attending this counseling, the aforementioned charges against him were dropped.

He underwent anger \nmanagement therapy for an unspecified period of time after this arrest. There is no \nadditional evidence in the record regarding the disposition of this arrest. (Item 4) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 2018 arrest, nolo contendre \nplea, and mental health counseling under Guideline J. The Government cross-alleged \nthis allegation under Guideline E. Applicant admitted both these allegations but claimed \nthat his counseling has helped him overcome the issues that led to the assault on his \nformer stepson. He claimed he has avoided any criminal conduct and has made better \ndecisions since his 2018 arrest and his subsequent counseling. (Items 1, 2, 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling about $53,000. He has not made a \npayment on these debts in at least three years. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and house fire were beyond his control. His poor spending \nhabits and poor financial planning were not beyond his control. \nThere is no documentary evidence of payments to or payment arrangements with\ncreditors for the SOR debts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \n \nAs there is no documentary evidence to show that the SOR debts were paid, \ndisputed, or otherwise resolved, I cannot find that Applicant has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Likewise, I cannot find that he has made a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. He has not provided evidence to show \nthat he has overcome the causes of his financial issues. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are \nongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn April 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with three criminal offenses, \nincluding a felony, for a physical altercation with his then 14-year-old stepson. Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadmitted striking and physically assaulting the victim. The above disqualifying condition \nis applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been about four and one-half-years since Applicant engaged in criminal \nbehavior. He underwent counseling for several months after the incident with his former \nstepson. He claimed that this counseling has helped alleviate the stressors that \ncontributed to his criminal behavior. With the exception of being involved in another \nincident involving domestic violence about 16 years ago, he has not engaged in other \ncriminal conduct. The significant amount of time that has elapsed since he has engaged \nin criminal behavior, in conjunction with his counseling and removal of the child from the \nhome, is persuasive evidence of successful rehabilitation, that the criminal behavior is \nunlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nThe adverse information in SOR \u00b6 3.a is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under another Guideline and supports an assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 16(c) is raised and \nGuideline E is established. The conduct the Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a is \nexplicitly covered under Guideline J. AG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nFor the reasons I included in my analysis of the Guideline J mitigating conditions, \nsuch as the passage of time without recurrence, and Applicant undergoing counseling, I \nconclude that the behavior alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a is unlikely to recur. For these same \nreasons, I find that this behavior no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/29/2022 \nDecision \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 28, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR, Government Exhibit (GE) 1) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant elected in his March 1, 2022 response to the SOR (Answer, GE 1) to\nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government \nsubmitted its written case on March 27, 2022. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \n \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on April 7, 2022. He did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on July 25, 2022. The Government\u2019s documents \nidentified as GE 1 through GE 5 in the FORM were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 55 years old. \nHe married in 1989, divorced and remarried in 2004, and divorced in 2017. He has two \nchildren, one adult and one minor; one of his children has special needs. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 and a project management certificate in 2019. He previously \nowned a home, from February 2005 to February 2017. (GE 1, 2, 4) \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. military from 1985 to 2012. He worked as \na network engineer for a previous company for three years, from June 2015 to June \n2018, when he was fired due to a disagreement with management. He was \nsubsequently unemployed until November 2019. He then worked for another \ngovernment agency from November 2019 to June 2020. As of his October 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), he was a network engineer for his employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since June 2020. He was granted a security clearance in 2005. (GE 1, 2, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four delinquent consumer debts, totaling \n$31,804 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d). In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant \ndisclosed and discussed his delinquent debts on his SCA, during his February 2021 \nbackground interview, and in his October 2021 response to interrogatories. A January \n2021 credit bureau report lists all of the SOR debts, and a March 28, 2022 credit bureau \nreport lists SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d (GE 1 \u2013 5) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his second divorce and raising a child \nwith special needs. In 2016, while separated from his second spouse and going through \na divorce, he made minimal payments totaling $1,200 monthly toward his debts. He \nbecame responsible for the debts incurred during his second marriage when his spouse \ndid not honor their agreement to share in the responsibility for the joint debts incurred \nduring their marriage. He was also ordered to pay alimony and child support. He was \nfalling slowly behind on his debts. \nApplicant sought help from a debt consolidation company, who informed him that \nit would represent him at a cost of $400 monthly. The debt consolidation company sent \nletters to his creditors and requested that all correspondence related to his debts be \ndirected to the company. He did not learn, until approximately one year later when he \nnoticed his credit score dropping drastically, that his debts needed to be delinquent in \norder for the debt consolidation company to negotiate and settle his debts. He also \nlearned at that point that the money he had paid to the debt consolidation company was \nheld in an escrow account until the company reached a settlement with his creditors. \nThe debt consolidation company settled only SOR \u00b6 1.d. He terminated his contract with \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe company in January 2018, and he began working to resolve his remaining debts. \n(GE 1 \u2013 4) \nApplicant stated in his SCA and response to interrogatories that he worked out \npayment plans with his creditors, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate \nhis claim. He stated in his Answer that he contacted the credit bureaus and explained \nwhat happened when he worked with the debt consolidation company. He stated that \nthe credit bureaus told him that \u201cthese accounts will be removed from [his] credit report \nin the very near future,\u201d and stated that they were all accounts that were \u201cvery old\u201d and \nfrom 2014. (GE 1 \u2013 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $11,182 charged-off personal loan. Applicant obtained this \nloan to pay his federal taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016. He acknowledged in his in his \nAnswer that this debt was still reported on his credit report. (GE 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $10,919 charged-off personal loan. Applicant obtained this \nloan to purchase home goods and pay for living expenses after his divorce. He stated in \nhis Answer that this debt was removed from his credit report. (GE 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $5,157 charged-off credit card. Applicant obtained this credit \ncard for living expenses. He stated in his Answer that this debt was removed from his \ncredit report. (GE 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $4,546 charged-off credit card. Applicant obtained this card for \ndaily living expenses. As previously discussed, he stated that the debt consolidation \ncompany settled this debt. Documentation reflects that the creditor offered to settle this \ndebt for $4,000 in April 2017 if Applicant made payments according to a payment \nschedule from April 2017 to September 2018. He did not provide documentation to \nshow that he abided by the creditor\u2019s proposed payment schedule and settled this debt. \nHe stated in his in his Answer that this debt was removed from his credit report. (GE 1, \n3, 4)  \nApplicant described his financial status as \u201cgood\u201d during his background \ninterview. He indicated that he timely paid his bills, he was able to save money, and his \nfinances were \u201cback on track.\u201d He stated in his in his Answer that he received $3,311 \nmonthly in military retirement pay and $3,656 in military disability pay. He also stated \nthat his current credit report reflects an exceptional payment history for his current \ndebts. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. Applicant has a history of not paying his debts. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. \nAlthough Applicant worked with a debt consolidation company from 2016 to \n2018, he elected to terminate his contract and resolve his debts on his own. He did not \nprovide any documentation of his efforts to resolve his outstanding debts, despite his \nfinancial capacity to do so. Rather, it appears he simply relied on his debts falling off \nhis credit reports. There is no evidence that he has received financial counseling. I find \nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debts continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) are not applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

He and his former wife separated in 2012 and have a teenage daughter. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps from August 2005 to December 2013. He deployed twice, once to the Middle East in 2009 on a combat deployment, and once to Asia in 2007 for nine months. He was a sergeant (E-5) when he received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving. (Tr. 26-29; GE 1 at 20, 37) After leaving military service, Applicant worked for Students Veterans of America from January 2014 to May 2018. He also attended college during this timeframe, but did not complete a degree. After that he was unemployed from May 2018 to August 2018 while he helped his mother who was diagnosed with cancer. He subsequently worked for private security companies including a family business. These positions paid between $13 and $16 per hour. In October 2020, Applicant applied for a position with a defense contractor and submitted a security clearance application (SCA). That position did not materialize.

Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2022. \nOn June 24, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for July 12, 2022. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3 into evidence. \nApplicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through AE C into evidence.

He and his former wife \nseparated in 2012 and have a teenage daughter. He served on active duty in the Marine \nCorps from August 2005 to December 2013. He deployed twice, once to the Middle East \nin 2009 on a combat deployment, and once to Asia in 2007 for nine months. He was a \nsergeant (E-5) when he received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance \nwhile serving. (Tr. 26-29; GE 1 at 20, 37) \nAfter leaving military service, Applicant worked for Students Veterans of America \nfrom January 2014 to May 2018. He also attended college during this timeframe, but did \nnot complete a degree. After that he was unemployed from May 2018 to August 2018 \nwhile he helped his mother who was diagnosed with cancer. He subsequently worked for \nprivate security companies including a family business. These positions paid between \n$13 and $16 per hour. In October 2020, Applicant applied for a position with a defense \ncontractor and submitted a security clearance application (SCA). That position did not \nmaterialize. On August 2, 2021, he started a position with another defense contractor \nwhere he continues to work, earning about $24 per hour. His annual gross salary is \n$50,000. (Tr. 14-23; GE 1 at 12-19) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being unemployed while he was \ncaring for his mother for three to four months in 2018 after she was diagnosed with cancer. \nHe used credit cards to pay his expenses, and his mother\u2019s bills. For a number of years \nafterwards, he was underemployed in low-paying positions. In addition, he was paying \n$650 a month in child support for his daughter. (Tr. 24, 29-33) \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied owing the alleged debts because they had fallen \noff of his credit report and they were beyond the statute of limitations and legally \nunenforceable. He intends to address delinquent debts that are on his credit bureau report \n(CBR), but not those which are no longer reported. (Tr. 35, 40) In April 2022, he hired a \ncredit repair company to help improve his credit. (AE C) The company did not provide \nbudget counseling. (Tr. 41, 51) He tried obtaining a consolidation loan in 2018, 2019, and \n2021 to help resolve his outstanding debts. He was denied each time because he did not \nqualify. (Tr. 47-48) \nBased on CBRs from January 2021 and December 2021, the SOR alleged thirteen \ndelinquent debts totaling about $19,000, which became delinquent between 2014 and \n2021. (GE 2, GE 3) The status of each debt is as follows: \n1. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,857 is the balance owed to an automobile loan \ncompany for a 2010 car Applicant purchased for his ex-wife. It was \nrepossessed in January 2014, and subsequently sold for an amount less than \nthe balance owed on the loan. He acknowledged that it is his debt.

Applicant \nadmits it is his debt, but he cannot recall what it relates to. It went into \ncollections in 2014. He does not intend to address this debt because it has \nfallen off of his CBR. (Tr. 39-40). \n3. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $1,099 is owed to an e-commerce company for retail \npurchases Applicant made. He admits that it is his debt. He stopped making \npayments on the debt in 2018 when his mother was sick, and he was \nunemployed for the summer. The debt is listed on his July 2022 CBR and he \nintends to pay it. His credit repair company has contacted the creditor to resolve \nit. (Tr. 42-45; AE A). \n4. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $997 is owed to a cell phone company. Applicant \nadmits that this is his debt. It went into collections in 2018. According to his July \n2022 CBR, it is unpaid. He intends to pay it. His credit repair company will \ncontact the creditor to resolve it. (Tr. 45-47; AE A) \n5. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $801 is owed to a company for a credit card Applicant \nused in 2018 for expenses. He obtained a second credit card from the company \nand intends to have his credit repair company resolve this old debt. According \nto his July 2022 CBR, the debt is in collections and is unpaid. (Tr. 49, 52; AE \nA) \n6. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $724 is owed to a company for a credit card he used \nin 2018. He admits that it is his debt, and he intends to have his credit repair \ncompany contact the creditor to resolve it. (Tr. 53) \n7. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $612 is owed to a company for another credit card \nApplicant used in 2018. It was charged off in 2019 and is listed on his July 2022 \nCBR. He intends to have his credit repair company contact the creditor to \nresolve it. (Tr.53; AE A). \n8. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $329 is owed to company for a credit card that was \ncharged off in 2017. Applicant admits the debt. It is listed on his July 2022 CBR. \nHe intends to have his credit repair company contact the creditor to resolve it. \n(Tr. 54; AE A) \n9. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i for $188 is owed to a company that helps people build \ncredit by making loans to them. Applicant took this loan out in April 2021. The \ndebt was placed in collections in September 2021. He admits the debt. It is \nlisted on his July 2022 CBR. He intends to have his credit repair company \ncontact the creditor to resolve it.

(Tr. 56) \n11.The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k for $541 is owed to a company for a credit card. Applicant \nsaid he resolved the debt for less than the alleged amount and he paid the \nbalance. (Tr. 57) He said he has a receipt proving that it is resolved. His July \n2022 CBR reports that it was a paid charge-off.

Applicant said this loan went into collections in May \n2018 and has since fallen off of his CBR. He never made a payment on this \nloan. (Tr. 59-60) \nApplicant has four or five other student loans that are unpaid. He thinks his total \nstudent loan debt is about $19,000. He intends to address them after he \nresolves his other debts. They are in deferment until the end of 2022. (Tr. 69, \n74-75) \n13.The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m for $56 is owed to a company for a book Applicant \npurchased while in college. It went into collection in May 2018. He asserted \nthat he returned the book, but the company does not have a receipt for it. He \ndoes not intend to pay it. (Tr. 60-61). \nApplicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $3,232 and his monthly \nexpenses are $2,780, including his $800 child support payment. He has about $452 \nremaining at the end of the month. He intends to apply to the Veterans Affairs (VA) for \ndisability. His daughter is moving to Japan this year, at which time his child support \nobligation will stop. He has some money in savings. (Tr. 32, 61-65; AE A) His girlfriend \nwith whom he has lived for the past two years works and contributes to their monthly \nexpenses. (Tr. 66) \nApplicant said he is still learning about finances and credit issues. He did not \nrealize that delinquent debts, including ones that have fallen off his credit report, could \njeopardize his ability to obtain a security clearance. The issue never arose during his \nprevious security clearance investigations. (Tr. 76-77) He intends to resolve his financial \nproblems because he wants to purchase a piece of property. (Tr. 80) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The \nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-\nperson concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and experienced financial problems, \nbeginning in 2014 and continuing into the present. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) because Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts have been ongoing since 2014 and all of them remain unresolved, \nexcept one. Applicant helped care for his ill mother during the summer of 2018 and also \nprovided financial support for her. Subsequent to that summer, he held low-paying \npositions and experienced short periods of unemployment until August 2021, when he \nobtained his current job. Those were circumstances beyond his control. However, he did \nnot provide sufficient evidence that he attempted to manage his debts as they were \naccumulating, which is necessary to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant \nhas not participated in budget or credit counseling, and there is minimal evidence to show \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat his financial situation is under control.

The evidence \nestablishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as to that debt, but does not provide mitigation \nfor the others which remain unresolved. \nApplicant stated that he did not intend to resolve debts that had fallen off of his \ncredit report because the statute of limitations had run. In ISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011) \n(internal citations omitted)), the Appeal Board stated: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been dropped from his credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off [one\u2019s] credit report is not meaningful evidence of \ndebt resolution.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The case \nwas assigned to me on July 21, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is married and has two daughters, ages 10 and 12. \nHe has a bachelor\u2019s degree (2005). Since April 2019, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Item 5.) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana on various \noccasions between at least June 1996 and June 2021; and (2) intends to continue to use \nmarijuana in the future. (Item 1.) He admitted the Guideline H allegations, with \nexplanations. He has had three knee surgeries, and the resulting arthritis causes him \nconsiderable pain and discomfort. Opioids are typically prescribed for his kind of pain, but \nhe did not feel comfortable with using opioids on a regular basis. He was diagnosed by a \ncredentialed professional who felt cannabis was a viable form of pain relief. He has a \nmedical license that allows him to use marijuana legally under his state\u2019s law. He is aware \nthat marijuana is still illegal under federal law. (Item 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s June 3, 2021 Personal Subject Interview (PSI) was consistent with his \nSCA and his Answer. He uses marijuana several times a week for pain relief. His doctor \nhas not prescribed any other pain relief medicine. Applicant does not want to use opioids. \nHe intends to use marijuana in the future. His marijuana use has not made him unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or lacking in poor judgment. Nor has his marijuana use caused him to \ndisregard rules, regulations, or laws. (Item 6.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \nA2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nabuse . . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant admitted that he has been using marijuana regularly since 1996 and that \nhe intends to continue to use it for pain relief. Facts admitted by an applicant in an SCA, \nan Answer to a SOR, or in an interview require no further proof from the Government. \nISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made \nto the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR \nCase No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, \nwhether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s \nfindings\u201d). \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s past use of marijuana, his current use, and his expressed \nintent to use in the future, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g) apply here. \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana more \nthan 25 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. He has, however, \ncontinued his regular use to the present day. And Applicant intends to continue to use \nmarijuana. His use has been frequent, and Applicant plans to continue using marijuana \nin the future. His use is not mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(a).  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information.

I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 and is pursuing another degree. He works part-time for a company and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2021. He has never married and has no children. Applicant disclosed on his June 2021 security clearance application (SCA) that he began using marijuana sporadically in high school in 1997, and used it more habitually in his 20s, smoking it on a daily basis and several times a day. During his 30s his usage declined and be took longer breaks from using marijuana. In the past four years, he has stopped seeking it out to purchase, and he reduced his usage. He disclosed that his current usage was once every couple of weeks while golfing with friends when they provide the marijuana. (Item 2) Applicant further disclosed in his SCA that he uses marijuana as a way to relax and enjoy time with his friends and while golfing when he has no responsibilities.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 3. Applicant provided a response to the FORM \nthat is marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to any of the \nevidence submitted and all exhibits are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned \nto me on September 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 and is pursuing \nanother degree. He works part-time for a company and has worked for a federal \ncontractor since May 2021. He has never married and has no children. \nApplicant disclosed on his June 2021 security clearance application (SCA) that he \nbegan using marijuana sporadically in high school in 1997, and used it more habitually in \nhis 20s, smoking it on a daily basis and several times a day. During his 30s his usage \ndeclined and be took longer breaks from using marijuana. In the past four years, he has \nstopped seeking it out to purchase, and he reduced his usage. He disclosed that his \ncurrent usage was once every couple of weeks while golfing with friends when they \nprovide the marijuana. (Item 2) \nApplicant further disclosed in his SCA that he uses marijuana as a way to relax \nand enjoy time with his friends and while golfing when he has no responsibilities. He had \nno intention of using marijuana regularly or in the evenings. If it were legalized at the \nfederal level he may consider more regular use, but it was not worth seeking it out at that \npoint. (Item 2) \nApplicant disclosed that he purchased marijuana from September 2000 to August \n2017. He regularly purchased marijuana from 2014 to 2017. He said he purchased it \nabout every few weeks for a few months, and then there would be times that he would \nnot purchase any for a few months. He stated that the reason he purchased marijuana \nwas because: \u201cIf an individual wants their own supply of marijuana to smoke at their \nleisure, for any period of time, they must seek out an individual [who] sells it and buy \nsome.\u201d (Item 2) He did not intend to purchase marijuana in the future. (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2021. Applicant \ntold the investigator that he did not have any intentions to stop using marijuana as he \nenjoyed how it makes him feel, and he planned to continue to socialize with his friends \nwho use marijuana. He further stated he has reduced his marijuana use, but did not plan \nto stop using marijuana. He said that he purchased marijuana once a week from \nSeptember 2000 to August 2017. He had no intention of purchasing it in the future. He \nhas never attended drug counseling, treatment, or drug education classes and has not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad his drug use assessed professionally. He has not been diagnosed as drug dependent \nor with drug abuse. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted that from October 1997 to May 2021 \nhe used marijuana with varying frequency; from September 2000 to August 2017, he \npurchased marijuana on various occasions; and he intended to continue using marijuana \nin the future. (Item 1) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant stated: \nMy use during this time was done with no malice or desire to intentionally \ndisobey or not comply with any laws, rules, or regulations. I used it simply \nfrom the standpoint that I enjoyed the sensation that consumption of \nmarijuana provided along with the social interaction of my friends who were \nalso experimenting at the time. \n \n \n \n* * * \nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, my desire for the sensation alongside all the other \nmitigating factors of acquiring marijuana have waned and discouraged me \nfrom using on any type of regular basis. Those mitigating factors would be \nthe people that I would have to associate with to acquire marijuana, any \npossible legal ramifications that may occur if I would get caught with the \nsubstance, and any negative circumstances that may affect my job or career \ndue to the previous two factors. (Item 1) \nApplicant explained in his answer that his use of marijuana did not impact his ability \nto be responsible and show up for work and perform his assigned tasks. He further stated \nthat \u201cI think it would be ignorant to deny it didn\u2019t have any effect, but it is reasonable to \nsay that effect has been minimal.\u201d (Item 1) He stated that his use of marijuana has never \nhad any negative repercussions with law enforcement and he has never received any \ncitations with regard to his use and possession of marijuana. (Item 1) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that he purchased marijuana because he \n\u201cwanted to enjoy that sensation on my own terms with a frequency that was determined \nby me.\u201d (Item 1) He further explained: \nWhen a person reaches a point where they decide to enjoy a substance at \ntheir own leisure, at their own pace, they must seek out a source to \npurchase it from. Because these substances are illegal, it creates a black \nmarket where individuals can acquire their desired substance. If a person \ndesires a substance, they are going to find a way to get it and it doesn\u2019t \nmatter what the substance is and in many cases it doesn\u2019t matter what the \nconsequences are. I have never sought out any other substances beyond \nmarijuana because of the mitigating factors I mentioned [previously].  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have not purchased any marijuana in several years and the primary reason \nfor that is because everything around the hassle of finding and buying it \nbecame more than I wanted to deal with, and it didn\u2019t seem worth it to me \nanymore. I didn\u2019t like the people I would have to interact with, and it was \ndifficult to find a good reliable source that also had good product. It reached \na point that the sensation I felt from marijuana wasn\u2019t worth the things I had \nto go through to acquire it. (Item 1) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s intent to continue to use marijuana, he stated in his \nanswer to the SOR the following: \nI admit to expressing at least a desire or intention to continue to use \nmarijuana in the future. My intention to use marijuana in the future is not \nmeant to be done with any malice or with the intention to defy laws, rules, \nor regulations. My use currently is sporadic. I play golf a couple times a \nmonth with friends and if one of them happens to offer some, I will partake. \nI enjoy the feeling and being able to relax while I\u2019m out having fun with my \nfriends. I only do it when I have no responsibilities to worry about during my \nfree time. I have no intention to use with any regularity or purchase any \nmarijuana at any point in the future. \nIf I had a job that tested regularly or required me to not use, I would have \nno problem adhering to that policy. Which is an example of my ability to \nfollow laws, rules, and regulations, if need be, as well as be responsible. \n(Item 1) \nApplicant also stated that he was told by his bosses and colleagues the importance \nof being honest during the security clearance process and he has been honest and he is \ntrustworthy. He chose to be forthcoming about his illegal drug use in his SCA and \ninvestigation. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that a lot of time had passed since \nhe indicated his intent to continue using marijuana. His SOR answer was in February \n2022 and his FORM response was in July 2022. He then stated that he was not \ncompletely sure of what his statement meant when he made it. He reiterated that he was \ntold to be honest and he was. He stated he had expressed a willingness to discontinue \nhis marijuana use in the future if it was worth it and his present job is worth it. He said his \njob is too important to him to jeopardize it by continuing to use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse continued with an analysis of the decriminalization of marijuana in many states \nand proposals in Congress to decriminalize it federally and a bill to forbid the use of \nmarijuana to be used to determine eligibility for a security clearance. (AE A) \nApplicant further stated that because he disclosed his marijuana use it shows his \noverall trustworthiness and honesty. He reiterated he has had no interaction with law \nenforcement or history of arrests. He has no intention of disobeying any laws, rules, or \nregulations he must adhere to in order to hold a security clearance. He further stated that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na high percentage of people in the country wou\n \nld not bring his marijuana activity to court \nand this indicates that they do not see his conduct as a risk to national security. He \nbelieves his willingness to disclose his past and be honest should outweigh his past drug \ninvolvement. He said he does his job, pays his bills and taxes, goes home and enjoys \u201ca \nfew of the liberties I still have.\u201d (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant admits he used marijuana from October 1997 to May 2021. He admits \nhe purchased marijuana from September 2000 to August 2017. In his June 2021 SCA, \nduring his June 2021 background interview with a government investigator, and in his \nFebruary 2022 answer to the SOR, he confirmed his intention to continue to use \nmarijuana in the future. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has a long history of using marijuana and a significant history of \npurchasing it. He repeatedly stated he intended to continue using marijuana with his \nfriends socially and if offered, he would use it when they golfed together. Applicant noted \nthat because he disclosed his illegal drug involvement it shows he is honest and \ntrustworthy and therefore the security concerns should be mitigated. Doing what you are \nlegally required to do when completing an SCA does not negate derogatory information. \nApplicant also noted that he has complied with laws, rules, and regulations and \nhas not had any interaction with law enforcement. The use of marijuana was illegal in \nmost states for the majority of the years Applicant was using it. Purchasing marijuana was \nalso illegal. This contradicts Applicant\u2019s assertions that he has complied with the law. \nTrue, he may not have been arrested for his violations, but not getting caught is not the \nsame as obeying the law. He indicated the reason he stopped purchasing marijuana was \nbecause the hassle it was to find and buy it was more than he wanted to deal with, he did \nnot like the people he had to interact with, and it was difficult to find a reliable source and \nget good product. Although he stated he did not intentionally intend to violate the law, his \nactions contradict his statement. \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant indicated that if he had a job that regularly tested for \ndrug use or required he not use illegal drugs, he would comply. In his response to the \nFORM, he stated a lot of time had passed since he made the above statements and he \nnow has a job that he is willing to stop using drugs for. Under the right set of \ncircumstances, Applicant is willing to comply with the rules and regulations of refraining \nfrom marijuana use. That is not the standard. \nApplicant listed his last drug use on his SCA as May 2021. He repeatedly stated \nhe used marijuana with friends when golfing. It is unknown if he used marijuana with his \nfriends after he completed his SCA because at that time he planned to continue using \nmarijuana. Regardless, his past use in May 2021 is recent and insufficient time has \nelapsed to establish a pattern of abstinence. Based on his repeated statements of using \nmarijuana with his friends, I am not convinced future use is unlikely to recur. He did not \nprovide evidence that he no longer associates with his friends who use drugs; changed \nor avoided the environment where drugs are used; or provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for a revocation of a national security \neligibility.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In his response to the SOR, he denied all allegations and stated the loans were \ncharged off and the debts appear with a $0 balance on his credit report.

The last \nactivity for all four debts occurred in January 2019, and they were charged off in \napproximately May 2019 by Applicant\u2019s student loan creditor (SLC). The CBRs reflect \nApplicant as the \u201cmaker,\u201d or the primary person responsible for the debts. (Item 4 at 11-\n12; Item 5 at 2-3) \nIn his April 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that his private student loans were \ncharged off by SLC, because it was \u201cunwilling to collect an amout (sic) that wouldn\u2019t result \nin a charge off. I personally have may (sic) every attempt possible to resolve this debt. \n[SLC] and my cosigner have refused to make resolving the issue possible.\u201d (Item 3 at 45-\n46)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he provided December 2021 letters from SLC \nindicating it was no longer attempting to collect the delinquent private student loans \nalleged in the SOR, and he was no longer required to make payments toward these debts. \nThis was based upon the age of each debt. Additionally, SLC notified him that it was \nrequired by law to notify the Internal Revenue Service to report the cancellation of a $600 \nor greater debt, which applied to all of these debts. It is unknown if he has reported the \ncancellation of these debts in his 2021 federal tax return.

He provided no documentary proof to support these assertions. (AE A) \nApplicant blames his co-signer for his inability to make payments toward the SOR \nallegations. According to him, SLC would not negotiate with him regarding modifying his \n$2,000 monthly loan payments without the involvement of his co-signer, who was \u201coff the \ngrid, \u2026uncontactable, and unwilling to cooperate with [SLC] in any circumstance.\u201d \nAdditionally, Applicant asserts that SLC was held accountable in 2016 for illegal and \nunethical practices, which directly affected him and his attempts to make partial and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nmodified payments toward his student loans.

According to his December 2021 CBR, these accounts are current. He has \n$143,709 in federal student loans that are currently deferred. He was unemployed from \nMay 2020 to December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s period of unemployment may have negatively affected his ability to \nmake payments toward his delinquent private student loans, which total over $165,000; \nhowever, he failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his debts in \nresponse to his financial setbacks. He also did not provide an adequate explanation as \nto why he was unable to pay his private student loans. Additionally, he failed to provide \ndocumentation to support his claims that he made attempts to make payments, partial \npayments, modified payments, and establish payment arrangements with SLC before it \ncharged off his delinquent student loans. There is no evidence in the record, other than \nhis claims, that he acted responsibly. Additionally, he provided no documentation to \nsupport his claims that SLC behaved in an illegal manner. \nApplicant argued that his private student loans were resolved, because SLC \ncharged off the debts and they are no longer attempting to collect payments from him. \nAlthough his debts are no longer legally enforceable, his failure to pay his SOR creditor \ndoes not negate his past conduct or failure to take more aggressive actions to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. As noted above, he did not provide documentary evidence of any \nactions to resolve his SOR debts before they were charged off by SLC. \nIn this case, Applicant failed to pay his private student loans, which required him \nto make $2,000 monthly payments. Shortly thereafter, he incurred $97,430 in automobile \nloans, which require him to make collective monthly payments of $1,833. These accounts \nare current, based upon his December 2021 CBR. This behavior demonstrates that he \npicks and chooses which creditors toward which he is acts in a responsible and \ntrustworthy manner.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2022. \n. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n and denied the \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He served in the military from 2005 to 2009 and was \ndeployed in combat operations. He received an honorable discharge. He attended \ntechnical school from 2009 to 2011. He attended college from 2011 to 2016 and earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree. He married in 2005 and divorced in 2011. He has a child from the \nmarriage who is 12 years old. He has two other children, ages 20 and 7, from previous \nrelationships. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2018. \nBefore then he had periods of unemployment and underemployment. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent student loans totaling \napproximately $67,408 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l), $6,371 of consumer debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \nand 1.n) and $34,897 of child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p). Applicant admits \nall of the debts, but disputes the amount owed in child support arrearages. In his January \n2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his child-support arrearages and \nstated that his monthly support obligations were too high and he was seeking a \nmodification to have the amounts more commensurate with his income. He said he was \nin contact with the child support caseworker. (Items 1, 2) \nThe debts alleged are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in security \nclearance application, his answer to the SOR, statements made to the government \ninvestigator during his background interview, and credit bureau reports from March 2020, \nMarch 2021, and January 2022. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he \nattributed his financial problems to lack of income and the high child-support payments. \nHe told the investigator in November 2002 he was ordered to pay $300 to support his \neldest child. He fell behind and was approximately $11,647 in arrears because he did not \nearn enough income to pay the full amount and other child-support obligations and \n1 It appears Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR is incorrectly dated as March 31, 2022, which would be before \nthe Statement of Reasons was issued. Other documents in Applicant\u2019s answer are dated May 20, 2022. It \nis therefore extrapolated that the correct date of the Answer is May instead March.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpenses. In November 2018, the amount was reduced to $250, which is garnished from \nhis wages. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant disputed the amount he owed on this debt \nand provided a document from the court administering the child support, which shows the \namount he owes in arrears is $10,851. (Items 1, 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that he was ordered to pay $190 to support his other \nchild. He fell behind in his payments as stated above, and his obligations are in arrears \nin the approximate amount of $23,250. In November 2018, his monthly obligation was \nreduced to $150 a month, which is garnished from his wages. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant disputed the amount he owed on this debt and provided a document from the \ncourt administering the child support, which shows the amount he owes in arrears is \n$20,186. (Items 1, 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that in March 2010, he was ordered to pay $600 for \nmonthly child support for his third child. He told the investigator that he is approximately \n$4,000 in arrears for unpaid support and medical bills associated with this child\u2019s birth. In \nNovember 2018, the amount of support was reduced to $500. It is being garnished from \nhis wages. The arrearages for this child were not alleged in the SOR and will not be \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that he has approximately $62,000 in \ndelinquent student loans that he began incurring from 2010 to 2016. He has not attempted \nto pay them because he does not have the resources. He has not contacted the creditors \nand cannot pay them until his finances improve. He stated he intended to contact the \ncreditors to find out if the loans could be placed in forbearance. He did not provide \nadditional information about the status of these loans. (Item 3) \nApplicant acknowledged the consumer debts alleged in the SOR began accruing \nin 2012 and 2014. He has not attempted to pay them because he does not have the \nfinancial resources. (Item 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that his financial problems are due to his divorce \nand his large child-support obligations. He went through a period when he could not find \nfull-time employment that paid enough to pay his obligations. In 2018, he was able to start \nmeeting his obligations. He said he intends to pay his debts. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans, consumer debts, and child-support \narrearages that began accumulating in 2012. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to being underemployed and unemployed. \nThese conditions were beyond his control. He has been steadily employed since 2018. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. It appears that Applicant has been making his monthly child-support \npayments, but has minimally reduced his arrearages. He has not paid, made payment \narrangements, or contacted the creditors for his delinquent student loans or consumer \ndebts. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and ongoing because he has not provided evidence \nhe is actively resolving them. He has minimally reduced his child-support arrearages, but \nstill has a large delinquent balance owed. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He did not provide \nevidence that he is participating in financial counseling or has a plan for paying his \ndelinquent debts. There is no evidence he made good-faith efforts to pay his delinquent \ndebts or that they are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant \ndisputed the balance owed on his child-support arrearages and provided documents to \nshow the current delinquent balance. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the extent that the balances \nare reduced, but does not mitigate the arrearages owed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 14, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

There were no \nobjections to the Items or AEs offered and they are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on September 29, 2022. \nAdministrative and Procedural Matters \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Turkey (Item 5). Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism \nand ongoing human rights abuses in Turkey. \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6 2.b.

He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, 1.f through 1.i, and 2.a. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is a high school graduate and earned some college \ncredits, but not a degree. He served in the military from January 1989 to March 1990 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. Applicant married in Turkey in 2000. His wife is a dual \ncitizen of Turkey and the United States. They have two children, ages 21 and 19 years \nold.

He stated he owed $4,000, but \nthe amendment would show he did not owe a balance. He said he was working with his \naccountant. He also disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his 2019 federal tax return \nand was working with his accountant to file that tax return.

(Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2021. He told the \ninvestigator that he had been late filing his federal income tax returns for tax years 2018 \nand 2019. He said he contacted the IRS and had been granted extensions for both tax \nyears. He said he did not owe taxes for either year and would receive a refund. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2022 answer to the SOR, he said, \u201call taxes are being filed to \ndate, currently 2020 and 2021 and are expected to be completed by our CPA by June 1, \n2022.\u201d (Item 1) He said he had requested extensions at the appropriate time, and he was \nwaiting for his accountant to complete his paperwork to file the tax returns. He said he did \nnot owe taxes. He said his accountant informed him that there was a backlog of 2020 \nfilings and his tax returns would be completed by June 1, 2022. He said he was told his \n2020 tax returns would be filed by then and his 2021 return would follow shortly thereafter. \nHe believed he would receive a refund. He said he would continue to work with his \naccountant to ensure timely filing. (Item 1) \nIn the FORM, Applicant was put on notice as to what documents were required to \nsubstantiate his claims about his tax returns. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he \ndid not say anything about his delinquent tax returns. Applicant did not provide a copy of \nhis 2018 federal tax return that he said was being amended, which presumably would \nhave been filed if he was requesting it be amended. He did not provide documentation to \nshow he had timely filed for extensions for tax years 2018, 2019, or 2020. He did not \nprovide copies of filed tax returns for 2018, 2019, and 2020, or any documentation from \nhis accountant. He did not provide an explanation for his failure to timely file for the three \ntax years. (AE A) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.i). They are \ncorroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA, statements to the government \ninvestigator, and a March 2021 credit bureau report. Applicant provided proof that the \ncollection account in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($2,424) was settled for $1,940 in February 2022. \nApplicant provided a copy of the page from his credit report showing this debt. The \ncomplete credit report was not provided. (AE B, C) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($4,735), 1.f \n($7,389), 1.g ($4,431), 1.h ($3,654), and 1.i ($3,532). He stated they were credit card \ndebts that he fell behind on paying. The same collection company holds the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h and 1.f. He said he contacted the collection company and it was unwilling to \naccept a reduced payment. He was going to contact an attorney to assist him. He also \ndisclosed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,735) and said it was a credit card debt now owned \nby a collection company. He had contacted the company to settle the debt. He said the \ndebt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,532), also a credit card debt held by a collection company, \nwas not owed to the creditor and would be dismissed in court. No documentation \nregarding any of the debts was provided.

He acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f, 1.g and 1.h and they were not being paid. He stated that in 2019, he purchased a \nboat for $35,000 and as he was driving it to his residence the engine failed. He sold the \nboat later in 2019 for $13,000. He also stated that during this time he was building a new \nhome. He told the investigator that he would not pay certain debts owed to the collection \ncompany as alleged in SOR until they accepted his offer to pay a lesser amount. \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c ($65), 1.d \n($319), 1.f, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i, and they were removed from his credit report. He did not \nprovide documents to show he paid these debts and they were removed from his credit \nreport. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, he stated that he had reached a payment \narrangement with the creditor and the debt would be resolved by May 2022. He did not \nprovide proof the debt was paid. (Item 1) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he and his family took cruises in 2017 and \n2018. He stated, \u201cWe may have outstanding debt but I have more than $300,000 in \ninvestments waiting for them to mature and previous debt to be settled.\u201d Applicant did not \nelaborate on his investments. (Item 1) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer \u201cAll noted previous collections will be paid and \nsatisfied by May 2022. (Item 1) He further stated, \u201cAll taxes are being filed to date and \ncurrently 2020 and 2021 are expected to be completed by our CPA by June 1st , 2022.\u201d \n(Item 1) He stated he had put measures such as budgeting, investing and savings plans \nin place to prevent any future problems. He had investments that provided a significant \ncushion. He stated, \u201cRegardless money is no longer a concern considering the available \nfunds to date and [incoming] capital from the sale of our house that will provide $160K \nover what is owed on the mortgage.\u201d No substantiating documents were provided. (Item \n1) \nApplicant stated in his response to the FORM, \u201cDuring 2019 and into 2020, we had \nsome unexpected expenses and life events, while the debts added up to an unsustainable \namount.\u201d He further stated that he had always planned to pay his debts sooner, but he \nhad extra expenses for his daughter who was attending college and his move. He said \nthe pandemic also affected him. He said he was investing and saving money. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Turkey and resides in Turkey. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that his \nmother-in-law is a permanent resident of the United States and holds a green card. She \nis a citizen of Turkey. He disclosed in his SCA that prior to the pandemic, she would live \nwith them in the United States for most of the year and said during his background \ninterview that she lived with them for two to six months a year, but due to the pandemic, \nshe had not been to the U.S. since 2020.

Applicant stated that she is close with her grandchildren, who were born in \nand are loyal to the United States, and would never put them in jeopardy or at risk. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal income tax returns. \nHe has numerous delinquent debts that he failed to pay. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to provide documentary proof that he filed his 2018, 2019 and 2020 \nfederal tax returns. He failed to provide any mitigation for why he failed to timely file those \nfederal income tax returns for three years. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that he has paid all of the debts alleged in the SOR, or they would \nbe paid by May 2022. He provided proof that he settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in February \n2022. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. He failed to provide proof that he paid the remaining \ndebts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his 2015 move, purchasing a boat in \n2019 and selling it later for less than he paid, buying a new house, unexpected college \nexpenses, and life events. His move may have been beyond his control, but he chose to \npurchase a boat and house, either ignoring his credit card debts or increasing them. His \ndaughter\u2019s unexpected college expenses may have been beyond his control, but it is \nunknown what life events affected his finances. Applicant alludes to investments he has, \nbut does not provide further details. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must \nhave acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did not. His debts began \naccumulating when he moved in 2015 and in 2017 and 2018, he took his family on \nvacation cruises and in 2019, he purchased a boat. He has not provided evidence that he \npaid the alleged debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling. Although he \nstates his finances are under control, his failure to provide corroborating evidence that his \ntax returns are filed or proof he paid his delinquent debts, prevents the application of AG \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6 20(c). Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and there is insufficient evidence that his financial \nissues occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His behavior casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nTurkey. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Turkey. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Turkey and a permanent resident of the \nUnited States. She visits Applicant and his family in the United States for extended \nperiods. She is retired, worked in the financial world, and has no ties to government \nentities. Because of Turkey\u2019s threat of terrorism and human rights issues, there is a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation, inducement, pressure, and coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a permanent resident of the United States. When she \nvisits Applicant and his family, she stays for extended periods. She is close to her \ngrandchildren and would never jeopardize their safety. She is retired and has no ties to \nthe government of Turkey. It is unlikely Applicant would be placed in a position of having \nto choose between his mother-in-law\u2019s interests and that of the United States. AG 8(a) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nInsufficient evidence was provided and Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. He mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nWithdrawn \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nMay 24, 2022, and did not respond. I was  assigned the case on September 6, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, \nand SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c, but denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3..a, regarding falsification of \nhis October 2017 and February 2, 2021 SCAs in response to Section 23 \u2013Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Drug Activity and Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances in the last seven \nyears, and while possessing a security clearance have you ever illegally used or \notherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance by answering \u201cNo\u201d; and SOR \n\u00b6 3.b. as cross-alleged under SOR \u00b6 2.a through 2.c. His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact (Item 1) \nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2015. He is unmarried and has no children. He obtained an \nundergraduate degree in 2014. He reported no military service. Applicant has worked for \ndefense contractors since 2014, with short periods of unemployment when he was \nworking on personal projects from November 2014 until June 2015. He obtained a \nsecurity clearance in 2017. (Item 2) \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b involved an arrest in November 2014, with a \ncharge of possession of marijuana, and the alleged arrest in May 2019, with a charge of \npossession of marijuana. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but noted that the \nmarijuana was obtained through dispensaries and used for sleep assistance and to \nincrease his appetite. For his 2014 marijuana possession offense, he was charged with \na misdemeanor, first offense, received a ticket, probation, and a fine. (Items 1, 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2021, personal subject interview (PSI), he volunteered to the \ninvestigator that he was offered marijuana by his cousin, and purchased some marijuana \nfrom him in 2014. (Item 4) He put some marijuana in his vehicle trunk on the way home, \nand was stopped for speeding by a police officer. Applicant was taken to jail, and was \nable to bail himself out. The PSI report states that he went to court at some point and he \n\u201cwas told to submit dismissal paperwork.\u201d (Item 4) Applicant told the investigator that later \nhe found out the case was dismissed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted the three SOR allegations that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about 2012 to about July 2021 (2.a); that he \npurchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2012 to about July \n2021 2.b; and 2.c, that he purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout July 2018 to about July 2021, while granted access to classified information. (Item \n1) \nHowever, in that same answer, he stated that the \u201ctime span was persuaded by \nthe investigator during the interview as a general from and to date.\u201d During his 2018 PSI, \nhe stated that \u201cestimated months and dates noted are fairly accurate.\u201d \nApplicant volunteered information about the May 2019 arrest for purchase and use \nof marijuana from his cousin. He told the investigator that it was an open case because \nhe did not know that his case had been fully dismissed. (Item 4) It is not clear what \nApplicant meant by that statement. \nApplicant used marijuana in college from 2012 to 2014. He also used marijuana \nperhaps once a year over the next couple of years for recreational use. He stated that he \npurchased from vendors in states where marijuana was legal from 2019 to the present \nwhen he was on vacation.  Applicant was drug tested when he was hired and stated that \nhe understood the employer policy on illegal drug use, and that it is against policy to use \nmarijuana while in federal employment. He believes that the legalization of marijuana is \ncoming and that it should not be an issue. (Item 4) \nApplicant stated that he used the marijuana also to assist with his anxiety and to \nmake him feel relaxed and creative. He emphasized that he has not developed any \ndependency on marijuana and has had no counseling or treatment. He compares his \nmarijuana use to alcohol. His future intent does not include the use of marijuana, so that \nhe can keep his job and security clearance. Applicant would use it if marijuana was \nlegalized. However, currently he will refrain from marijuana use, although he could not \nrule out using marijuana in the future if it is legalized. He stressed that his use of marijuana \nhas \u201cno criminal intent.\u201d (Item 4) \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged in SOR 3.a and 3.b that Applicant falsified material facts on his \nOctober 17, 2017 and February 2, 2021 SCAs by answering \u201cNO\u201d to the questions in \nSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs of Drug Activity as set forth in subparagraph 1.a and \n1.b, and 2.a through 2.c above. It further alleged that had he denied ever using drugs or \notherwise being involved with a drug substance while possessing a security clearance \nand he answered \u201cNO.\u201d \nApplicant denied the falsification allegations because he believes he made a \nmistake in assuming the other sections correlated.

He believes the process to be very difficult. He added \nthat due to having previously submitted SCAs and having pre-populated information the \nresubmission had an error in it. He added that he would be willing to discuss any items \nwith the investigator if needed. He stated that he did not report the use because he did \nnot believe it was serious. (Item 4) He has held a security clearance since 2017. On both \nSCAs, he answered \u201cNO.\u201d to have you ever illegally used or otherwise been illegally \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other \nthan previously listed? He did not add any information concerning this issue in his 2022 \nDOHA interrogatories. He insisted in his subject interview that he was never going to list \nthe information concerning use of marijuana on his SCA because he wanted to tell an \ninvestigator whenever he was interviewed. He admitted that he was properly trained on \nreporting of such issues, but just did not think about it when he recertified his security \nclearance application. (Item 4) Applicant made no clarifications to his reasons for \nomission except that he would disclose to the investigator. \n` \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana continued until at least July 2021. He was \narrested in 2014 and 2019. He admitted to the use of marijuana in 2021. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted that \nthe illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. This is \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he used and purchased marijuana as alleged \nin the SOR for some years and while holding a security clearance. The record also \nestablishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after being employed with a Federal \ncontractor and after completing his earlier security clearance application; 2014 and 2019 \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narrests for marijuana possession, and Applicant\u2019s statement that he would continue to \nuse it recreationally if legalized. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he knew that his \nposition with a federal contactor required him to refrain from using illegal drugs shows a \nreckless disregard for rules and regulations. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): any \nsubstance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \u2026 \npurchase or sale; AG \u00b6 25(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2021. He has \njust recently stated that he would abstain from marijuana use because it is a tangible \nthreat to his security clearance. He believes his open and honest response to his \ninvestigator should prove that he is trustworthy. He argued that although he has been a \ndrug user since college and after, because he is finally forthright, the Government should \nignore the former illegal marijuana use because he made a mistake by not putting it on \nhis security clearance application in response to Section 23 . This does not mitigate his \ncase. This conduct casts doubt about his judgment and reliability. I find that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose \nthe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and it cross-alleges the money \nlaundering alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;. \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature adult who has completed the adjudication process at least \ntwice during his career. He knew that the policy is against use of marijuana. His claim that \nhe just made a mistake or an error on his security clearance application is unsupported \nby corroborating evidence. I find that he intentionally falsified his applications and that he \ndid not report that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nin Section 23 by answering \u201cNO.\u201d the information that he admitted to in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, and SOR 2.a. through 2.c, or that he used marijuana while holding a security \nclearance. Thus, the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omission \nuntil he was confronted with the evidence during the PSI. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification is arguably infrequent, but it \nwas recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. It was not minor, because \nfalsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole Person \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my \nwhole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s career as an employee of defense \ncontractors. I have also considered that he held a security clearance \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsince 2017. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor or to question him about the allegations \nin the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003).After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines J, H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J :  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAgainst APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E :  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nNoreen A.

(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 44-46, 49-52.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant had seven past-due debts, including one automobile repossession, totaling $25,610 (SOR 1.a through 1.g). Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR with the exception of SOR 1.b and SOR 1.f, which he denied. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated July 20, 2021; and May 24, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3 and 2.) Applicant stated that the delinquent debts he admits all arose before the 2018 time-frame, except for 1.a. He went through several years of underemployment and unemployment that lasted from 2011 through 2016. His pay fluctuated during this period.

The case was assigned \nto me on June 1, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on June 7, 2022. The case was heard on June 29, 2022. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing on July 8, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit A, \nwhich was also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain open for the \nreceipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits B and \nC, which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed on July 21, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old and married for the second time with seven children. At \nthe time of the hearing four children were minors and lived with him and his second wife. \nHe has two master\u2019s degrees. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a \nSoftware Engineer and is trying to retain a security clearance in relation to his \nemployment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 44-46, 49-52.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven past-due debts, including one \nautomobile repossession, totaling $25,610 (SOR 1.a through 1.g). Applicant admitted the \nallegations in the SOR with the exception of SOR 1.b and SOR 1.f, which he denied. The \nexistence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated July 20, 2021; \nand May 24, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3 and 2.) \nApplicant stated that the delinquent debts he admits all arose before the 2018 \ntime-frame, except for 1.a. He went through several years of underemployment and \nunemployment that lasted from 2011 through 2016. His pay fluctuated during this period. \nAt one point Applicant and his family lived in public housing. He also had serious and \nexpensive family issues between 2016 and 2018. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, \n26; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 17-20, 42, 46-47, 52-57.) \nIn 2016, he accepted a job with the Federal government that required a trans-\ncontinental move. While the pay was substantially higher than what he was previously \nearning, it was not sufficient for him to pay his regular debts and resolve his past-due \nindebtedness. In August 2019, he obtained his current employment, which carried \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanother substantial raise in pay. With the increase in salary, he has been working to \nresolve the debts in the SOR, as described below. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 16-17, 20-\n21.) \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted having a charged-off automobile loan in the amount of \n$8,649. Applicant reached a payment arrangement with this creditor in April 2021 in order \nto keep the car. He made continuous and timely monthly payments and paid this debt off \nin June 2022, as shown by documentation from the creditor. Now that this debt is \nresolved, Applicant has additional funds to pay toward his other debts. (Government \nExhibit 4 at 7; Applicant Exhibit A; Applicant Exhibit B at 4-6; Tr. 22-24, 31, 60-61.) \n1.b. Applicant has consistently denied any knowledge of this past-due debt in the \namount of $2,919. He stated that a dispute was filed with the credit-reporting agencies. \nThis debt does not appear in the most recent credit report in the record. (Government \nExhibit 2.) Based on the available evidence, I find that there is insufficient evidence to \nshow that Applicant actually owes this debt. In addition, I also find this debt is subject to \na legitimate dispute. (Government Exhibit 4 at 6-7; Tr. 24-27, 57-59.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $1,621 for a charged-off debt. This debt \nalso arose in the 2016 time-frame. He admitted that it remains due and owing. For various \nreasons, including the fact that the original creditor is now out of business and the current \ncreditor will not accept payments, he has been unable to resolve this debt. He is willing \nand able to make payments. I find this debt is unresolved through no fault of Applicant. \n(Government Exhibit 4 at 6; Tr. 28-29.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off debt in the amount of $877. This debt \narose in relation to a washer and dryer Applicant purchased after moving across the \ncountry w\n ith his family. He wound up returning both appliances due to quality issues. He \nhas filed a dispute with the credit-reporting agencies, as shown by the most-recent credit \nreport in the record. I find that this debt is subject to a legitimate dispute. (Government \nExhibit 4 at 5-6; Tr. 29-32, 58.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he is indebted to a credit union for a charged-off debt \nin the amount of $108. This credit union is only found in one state, on the opposite side \nof the country from where Applicant now resides. Applicant has recently corresponded \nwith this credit union to clarify payment arrangements for the debt. This debt is not yet \nresolved. (Answer; Applicant Exhibit B at 3, 12-13; Tr. 32-35, 59.) \n1.f. Applicant has consistently denied any knowledge of this past-due debt in the \namount of $2,694. He stated that a dispute was filed with the credit-reporting agencies. \nThis debt does not appear in the most recent credit report in the record. Based on the \navailable evidence, I find this debt is subject to a legitimate dispute. (Government Exhibit \n4 at 8; Tr. 25-36, 61.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing $8,747 for a vehicle that was repossessed during \nthe period he was unemployed or underemployed. This debt was subject to a dispute that \nwas resolved, as reported by the automobile finance company in 2021. (Government \nExhibit 3 at 4; Government Exhibit 4 at 7; Tr. 36.) This debt does not appear on the most \nrecent credit report in the record. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 36-39, 64-65.) I find that this \ndebt was the subject of a legitimate dispute. \nApplicant stated that his current financial situation is stable, though tight. He is able \nto pay his current debts. The credit reports in the record confirm that fact. Now that he \nhas paid off the debt in SOR allegation 1.a in full, he has additional funds to use toward \nother indebtedness. Applicant also pointed to the fact that the period of delinquency was \nseveral years in the past, and he has had no past-due debts since that time. This is \nimportant since Applicant has been working to support his large family on one income. \n(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 39-44.) \nApplicant indicated that current structural issues with his home might also be \naffecting his finances. He submitted photographic evidence to support his statements. \n(Applicant Exhibit C.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted several letters of recommendation from four current or past \nco-workers and friends. They all describe him as an able, intelligent, honest and forthright\nperson. The writers confirm the existence of the family issues Applicant discussed in his\ndocumentary evidence and testimony. They describe him as a \u201creliable and dependable\nperson\u201d with outstanding character. All of the writers, who also hold security clearances,\nrecommend Applicant for a position of trust without reservation. (Applicant Exhibit B at 7-\n11.) \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $25,615 for six past-due debts and one automobile \nrepossession as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAll four of the mitigating conditions are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. His current \nfinancial situation is stable. He is paying everyday debts. All but one of the debts in the \nSOR arose before 2018. Most of them arose during the 2011 to 2016 time frame, when \nApplicant was unemployed or underemployed. Applicant has behaved responsibly in \nresolving his debts. When the debt in SOR 1.a became delinquent due to serious \nhousehold issues, he made successful efforts to resolve the debt to the creditor\u2019s \nsatisfaction. He filed disputes with the credit reporting services with regard to the debts in \nSOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. SOR 1.c and 1.e are not yet resolved.

He has many daily expenses due to his family size and the \nfact he provides the sole financial support. Under the particular facts of this case, I find \nthat he behaved responsibly under the circumstances. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted). \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his debts and has taken significant steps to resolve the debts. Applicant has \nthe knowledge and ability that will allow him to resolve his other debts and stay on a \nproper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the financial concern allegations in the \nSOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation by working to resolve his debts in a responsible \nmanner, which does not evince poor judgment or unreliability. He has minimized the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, \nthe record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability \nfor national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on November 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old flight scheduler for a defense contractor, employed since \nFebruary 2020. She served as an aviation resource manager in the Air National Guard \nfrom 2009 to 2021, and currently serves in the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a joint \noperations center non-commissioned officer since 2021. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2013 and completed some credits toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. She married in \n2013 and has two children, ages eight and eleven. She has held a secret security \nclearance since 2009. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has ten delinquent debts, \nincluding seven delinquent student loans, two small medical debts and a small phone \nutility debt, totaling about $31,000. Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations, and submitted documentary evidence with her Answer to the SOR. \nApplicant explained in testimony that she fell behind on debts when she left college \nin 2015 with a toddler and a baby, and her husband was medically discharged from the \nmilitary. She was unable to finish her education, and instead began working to support \nher family. Her husband was unable to maintain regular work and started an unsuccessful \nbusiness in 2020. He secured reliable, full-time work in July 2021, and consistently \ncontributes toward the family income. \nApplicant did not pay on her student loans since 2015 because of a lack of income, \nand did not understand the availability of income-driven payment plans. During her \ninterview with a Government investigator in May 2020, she learned how to set up a \nstudent-loan repayment plan, but understood the COVID-19 related Federal student loan \nrepayment freeze provided her with more time to arrange a repayment plan. During that \ntime, she paid other debts and switched to a higher paying job, however; her husband \nstarted his unsuccessful business that did not assist in supplementing the household \nincome. \nApplicant paid the two small medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i), and the phone \nutility interest charge for turning in equipment late four years ago (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant \ncontacted the Department of Education regarding consolidating her student loans. All of \nthe loans were consolidated into one direct student loan in March 2022. Once the COVID-\n19 loan repayment freeze is lifted, she has budgeted to pay $214.30 per month, and has \nagreed to an automatic debit from her account. In good faith, she has made several \npayments toward her loans to take advantage of the interest-free period. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant and her husband now earn nearly $140,000 per year, have about $7,400 \nin savings, and a retirement account.

Applicant has \nexcellent military evaluations and earned an Air Force Commendation Medal for her work \nwhile on deployment. Her colleagues and friends describe her as trustworthy, loyal, and \na team player. She completed formal financial counseling in November 2022, and \nprepared a monthly budget. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro.

Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts, including student loans that were exacerbated \nby her spouse\u2019s inconsistent employment and the resulting loss of income when he left \nthe military. Applicant left school before completing her degree to support her family. She \nhas increased her salary and her husband has maintained steady employment to the \npoint where they are now financially secure and able to meet all expenses. She has taken \nsubstantial action to resolve her debts, and is currently in a satisfactory repayment plan \nto address her student loans when the freeze is lifted. She has even made payments \ntoward the loan to take advantage of the zero interest environment during the freeze \nperiod. \nApplicant has regained control of her finances and resolved the SOR debts through \ndiligent work and tenacious efforts. Applicant has used the resources available to her to \nresolve accounts, has obtained financial counseling, and has a current budget with a \npositive net monthly remainder. I find that Appellant\u2019s financial issues no longer cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She has overcome her \nfinancial problems and additional delinquencies are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), \n(c), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

(Item 1) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 16, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, he was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on August 24, 2022.

Applicant \ntimely responded to the FORM, submitted five documents that were marked and admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through AE E.

Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review \nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a consultant for his sponsor since April 2020. He reported that he was previously self-\nemployed or employed by other employers in a number of briefly-held part-time and full-\ntime positions since 2014. He was unemployed for two periods (January 2020 \u2013 April \n2020, during which he collected unemployment benefits while watching television; and \nNovember 2016 \u2013 January 2017, during which he supported himself with his savings and \nvisited his mother overseas). He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. He has never \nserved in the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He was married in \n2018. He indicated that he has one daughter. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, dated April 26, 2022); \nItem 2 (SF 86, dated January 22, 2021); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nFebruary 23, 2021); Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, \ndated February 11, 2021); and Item 5 (Verato Credit Report, dated September 22, 2021). \nIn is SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some financial issues. He listed 12 \ndelinquent accounts and stated that he was either disputing some of them or working on \npaying them off. He attributed his financial situation to unemployment, which purportedly \ncommenced in 2018. (Item 2 at 43-53) On February 23, 2021, he was interviewed by an \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, \nhe described his delinquent accounts and claimed that his periods of unemployment \ncontributed to his financial difficulties. He said he prioritized his accounts and was trying \nto satisfy living expenses. The investigator offered him the opportunity to furnish financial \ndocumentation to support his claims, but he did not do so. (Item 3 at 15) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a \u201cquick summary of recent events \nthat caused [him] to use [his] credit.\u201d He indicated that he had been working in several \nlow paying jobs \u2013 sometimes two or three at a time \u2013 just to bring in income to support \nhis family. He had to use his credit to help pay his bills, but he still was unable to make \nminimum payments. He finally obtained a good-paying job and started making payments, \nbut in January 2020, everything changed. He was admitted to the emergency room and \npurportedly experienced significant medical issues, and was diagnosed with cirrhosis, \nanemia, encephalopathy (brain disease), and esophageal varices. He returned to work \nbut was laid off during a reorganization. He was again hospitalized and purportedly almost \ndied. During the same period, his wife also got sick and was admitted to the hospital \nwhere she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Her employer fired her. His daughter was \nplaced in a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts, depression, and delusions. After his wife \nobtained another good-paying job, they focused on paying their medical bills, and intend \nto move on to addressing their other delinquent accounts. (Item 1 at 1) He failed to submit \nany documentation to verify his claims regarding the medical issues for himself or his \nfamily; his wife\u2019s employment issues; or any activity regarding paying off medical bills. \nIn his Response to the FORM, Applicant added the following, \u201cAs my wife and I \nare dying of separate medical conditions, my first priority is to pay the many doctors and \nthe hospital bills that we have.\u201d He added that he had entered a credit card settlement \nprogram that includes 11 accounts that consists of over $31,000 of the debt listed.\u201d (AE \nA) He also submitted documentation regarding the settlement program (AE B; AE C), as \nwell as statements from two creditors indicating that the accounts had been resolved. (AE \nD; AE E)   \nEvidence submitted by the government indicates that several of Applicant\u2019s \naccounts have been settled for less than full balance; paid off; or paid account/zero \nbalance. (Item 4 at 11-16; Item 5 at 6) Evidence submitted by Applicant indicates that \nthere are ten accounts in his settlement program, totaling $31,583, and that commencing \non October 28, 2022, he was required to make a monthly payment of $501.66 to start the \nprogram. (AE B; AE C) In addition, there are three accounts that are reported as having \nbeen disputed after resolution (DAR), with two of those accounts in the settlement \nprogram. The actual status of those accounts is that they appear to have been resolved. \nThe SOR alleged 20 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $55,404, that \ncan be separated into three different groups (paid off or otherwise resolved, including \nthose in the DAR status; in the settlement program and in the process of being addressed; \nand those not yet in the process of being resolved), as set forth below: \n1 \u2013 Those accounts that have been paid off or otherwise resolved, including those \nin the DAR status: \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $317 that was \nplaced for collection.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 20 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $55,404. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to several \nfactors, described more fully above. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but \nthere is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of \nan ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant acknowledged having some \nfinancial issues, and he initially attributed his financial situation to unemployment. In \nJanuary 2020, unexpected medical issues commenced involving Applicant, his wife, and \nhis daughter. As a result of those combined issues, he focused in paying his medical bills \nwith the eventual intention of transitioning to his other delinquent accounts. Applicant had \nseveral significant medical issues \u2013 all largely beyond his control \u2013 and was diagnosed \nwith cirrhosis, anemia, encephalopathy (brain disease), and esophageal varices. He lost \nhis job. His wife was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Her employer fired her. Their daughter \nwas placed in a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts, depression, and delusions. After he \nand his wife obtained other good-paying jobs, they focused on paying their medical bills, \nand will then move on to addressing their other delinquent accounts.

As noted above, in \nhis Response to the FORM, Applicant said: \u201cAs my wife and I are dying of separate \nmedical conditions, my first priority is to pay the many doctors and the hospital bills that \nwe have.\u201d  He entered a credit card settlement program that includes 10 different \naccounts.    \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant acted in a reasonable manner \nwhen dealing with the significant medical issues over which he had no control. Treatment \ncame first, followed by efforts to maintain his medical accounts current, something he \nappears to have been successful in doing as no medical accounts are delinquent. The \ndouble whammy of losing his job and his wife\u2019s job interrupted his efforts. However, with \nnew jobs they returned to their intended course of action. In an effort to address his other \ndelinquent accounts, he entered into a settlement program. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant and his wife, both of whom are purportedly dying of separate medical \nconditions, have initially focused on their medical bills before turning to their other bills. \nThe transition has begun and other delinquent bills have been resolved or are in the \nprocess of being resolved. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthere a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered \nsome specifics regarding past or proposed repayment efforts; submitted some \ndocumentary evidence to reflect some payments made; and entered into the settlement \nprogram. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nOn June 30, 2008, the President issued Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 13467, \nReforming Processes related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for \nContractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security \nInformation. The Continuous Evaluation Program (CEP) was essentially established in \n2017, because on December 14, 2016, Directive 3 was issued by the Security Executive \nAgent (SEAD 3), Reporting Requirements for Personnel with Access to Classified \nInformation or Who Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 12, 2017. SEAD 3 \nestablished reporting requirements for all covered individuals who have access to \nclassified information or hold a sensitive position. Because Applicant\u2019s medical and \nfinancial situations are known to the DCSA and his employer, his security manager and \nthe CEP will periodically review and evaluate Applicant\u2019s continuing efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. Should Applicant falter in those efforts, an incident report will be \ngenerated to enable an updated security eligibility analysis. \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current \nfinancial information. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances do not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case \nNo. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations. The SOR alleged 20 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$55,404. Applicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status \nto several factors, described more fully above. He was unemployed for two periods \n(January 2020 \u2013 April 2020, during which he collected unemployment benefits while \nwatching television; and November 2016 \u2013 January 2017, during which he supported \nhimself with his savings and visited his mother overseas). He reported little or minimal \neffort to seek other employment. He failed to submit any documentation to verify his \nclaims regarding the medical issues for himself or his family; his wife\u2019s employment \nissues; or any activity regarding paying off medical bills. Most of his reported delinquent \naccounts are still unresolved. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving as a consultant for his sponsor since April 2020. He reported that \nhe was previously self-employed or employed by other employers in a number of briefly-\nheld part-time and full-time positions since 2014. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1996. Applicant had several significant medical issues \u2013 all largely beyond his control \u2013 \nand he lost his job. His wife was also diagnosed with a serious medical condition, and \nshe lost her job. Their daughter had serious psychological conditions. After he and his \nwife obtained other good-paying jobs, they focused on paying their medical bills, and will \nthen move on to addressing their other delinquent accounts. It appears that the transition \nhas already begun, and some accounts have been resolved. He entered a credit card \nsettlement program that includes 10 different accounts.

Overall, the evidence \nleaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has successfully \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.

She was previously married on two occasions and was\ndivorced in approximately 2007, and again in 2017. She is currently unmarried and\nresides with her three children, ages 5, 10, and 14. Applicant began working for her\ncurrent employer two years ago. She works in data management and assists retired and\nenlisted service members with their health insurance benefits. Her employer requires\nher to be issued a trustworthiness eligibility to perform specific employment duties. (GE\n1, GE 2; Tr. 7-20) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s use of controlled substances\nfrom 2004 to June 2020. Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged approximately eight drug-\nrelated arrests and two arrests for assault, as follows:\nApplicant began using methamphetamine (crystal meth) around the age of 20\n(2004). Her father had committed suicide when she was 18 years old, and she started \nhanging out with friends who used drugs.

Applicant \nadmitted at the hearing that she could not remember all the details of her arrests and \nconvictions, but she did acknowledge that almost all of her drug-related arrests, cited \nabove, involved crystal meth. At one point, she was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail \nfollowing an arrest, but she only served about 10 days in jail. After her September 2007 \narrest for possession of drug paraphernalia, the court sentenced her to six-and-a-half \nmonths in jail. (Tr. 23, 26-29; GE 1, GE 3) \nApplicant admitted that she gave birth to her daughter in 2008 while serving her \nsix-and-a-half month jail sentence. After her release, she stayed out of legal trouble for \nabout five years, but she continued her illegal use of controlled substances. She began \nto use prescription pain pills, without a valid prescription, on a daily basis. In 2012, \nApplicant\u2019s doctor prescribed her Suboxone, a medication to treat opioid addiction, and \nshe gave birth to her second daughter. She also admitted that she used crystal meth \nagain in about 2015 on a couple of occasions, but she could not recall the details. She \nlost custody of her two daughters following her arrest in November 2016 for assault \n(domestic violence) with injury. This arrest involved a fight with her youngest daughter\u2019s \nfather. He had hit her in the face with a television remote control, and she retaliated by \nbiting him. The children were in the house at the time and both Applicant and her \ndaughter\u2019s father were arrested. She was required to take anger-management classes. \nHer daughters were eventually returned to her by the court. (Tr. 28-36, 43; GE 1, GE 2) \nApplicant continued using Suboxone, with a valid prescription, from 2012 through \n2016. In 2017, she started going to the methadone clinic. She was pregnant at the time \nwith her third child. In December 2018, she injured her arm and required medical \ntreatment. To help Applicant calm down immediately following the injury, her mother \ngave her an unprescribed medication, possibly Valium or Xanax. When Applicant and \nher daughter arrived at the hospital, the staff notified Child Protective Services due to \nthe belief that Applicant was under the influence of a controlled substance while in \ncontrol of her daughter. Applicant stopped visiting the methadone clinic in 2019. She \nlost custody of her children again in 2019 due to her drug addiction. In 2019, she started \nbuying Suboxone illegally from known sources. She continued to purchase Suboxone \nillegally until June 2020. (Tr. 28-35, 36-38, 43-51; GE 2) \nIn June 2020, Applicant went to a drug treatment program to overcome her \nsubstance abuse addiction. She also wanted to regain legal custody of her children and \nlive a drug-free lifestyle. She was diagnosed with opioid dependence, severe. She was \ndevoted to her recovery and she successfully completed the substance abuse treatment \nprogram in September 2020. At that time, her condition was listed as opioid \ndependence, severe, in remission. Thereafter, the court returned Applicant\u2019s children to \nher custody. (Tr. 45-55; GE 4) \nSince June 2020, Applicant has remained completely sober and has not \nrelapsed. She stated that she was tired of being a terrible mother to her children, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe was tired of living the life of a drug addict. She has remained free from illegal \nsubstances and addictive prescription medications since June 2020. She does not \nconsume alcohol because it is a mood-altering substance that can cause her to relapse. \nAfter she completed treatment, she regularly attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) support meetings and was paired with a sponsor. She now \noccasionally attends an AA or NA support meeting if she feels the need, and she \ncontinues to communicate with her sponsor and sober friends. Her family members \nremain active in supporting her recovery. She does not associate with her old friends \nwho continue to use illegal drugs. Her definition of \u201csober\u201d is \u201cto be free.\u201d She testified \nthat she is a completely different person since June 2020, and she wakes up every \nmorning feeling gratitude. She is committed to her sobriety, her children, and her \nsecond chance at life. (Tr. 45-55)\nFollowing the hearing, Applicant submitted seven letters of recommendation. \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, since March 2021, Applicant shows up for work as \nscheduled and performs her job duties in a successful manner. She recommended \nApplicant be allowed to continue working on the assigned government contract. A \npsychosocial support employee from the treatment facility, who met Applicant in August \n2020, noted that she witnessed Applicant transform during treatment and could see that \nshe wanted a better life. After Applicant\u2019s successful completion of treatment, the \nsupport employee reported seeing Applicant attending community substance abuse and \nrecovery events. Even though Applicant is a busy single mom holding down a stable \njob, she has reached out several times to help others start their own recovery process. \nApplicant\u2019s friend and family members all described Applicant as a new person who \ncontinues to set a good example for her children. They all reported how proud they were \nof her continued sobriety and productive lifestyle. (AE A- G) \n \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may \nbe made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), and 31(b). Applicant admitted \ncriminal conduct in eight drug-related arrests between 2006 and 2018, two arrests for \nassault in 2012 and 2016, and a minor offense in 2007. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the trustworthiness concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct raises serious trustworthiness concerns, \nand calls into question her ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations. She has a long \nhistory of multiple offenses that occurred from approximately 2006 through 2018. On the \nother hand, she has demonstrated several responsible and positive changes. Since \nJune 2020, she has abstained from using any mood-altering substances, to include \nalcohol. She is committed to her recovery and no longer associates with her old friends \nentangled in illegal activities. She is involved in her children\u2019s lives and she is \nperforming well at her place of employment. She has matured and is now more \nresponsible. Four years have passed since she was charged with violation of a criminal \noffense. I find there is sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate through the \npassage of time that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct will not recur. The criminal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \u2026 \nof substance use disorder. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used a variety of illegal drugs, to include crystal meth and opiates \nwithout a valid prescription, from about 2004 to June 2020. In June 2020, she was \ndiagnosed with opioid dependence, severe. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant used illegal drugs, to include crystal meth and opiates, over a long \nperiod of time and to the point of addiction. Her last use of illegal drugs occurred in June \n2020, when she entered a substance abuse treatment program. At that time, she was \ntired of living the life of a drug addict and she wanted to regain custody of her children. \nShe realized that she needed to make drastic changes in order to be a better mother \nand to live a life free from all mood-altering substances. She embraced the principles of \nthe drug-rehabilitation program, and she testified at the hearing that she is a new \nperson today. She has not used any illegal substances for two-and-a-half years. She \noccasionally attends AA or NA meetings when needed, she regularly communicates \nwith her sponsor, and she has family members and sober friends who support her \nsobriety. She is involved in community programs for substance abuse awareness and \nhas actively encouraged others to get treatment. \nI find Applicant is sincere about her commitment to remain drug-free since the \nsuccessful completion of her substance abuse treatment program.

The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant took responsible measures to turn her life around. She has not been \ncharged with a criminal offense over the last four years, and she has not used any \nillegal or mood-altering substances for the last two-and-a-half years. She made efforts \nto begin a life of sobriety well before the SOR was issued. Her employer stated that \nApplicant is a productive employee and recommended that she be permitted to remain \nactive on the government contract. Her friend, family members, and a medical \nprofessional from the treatment facility reported that Applicant is a new person \ncommitted to a drug-free lifestyle. I find that future criminal conduct and illegal drug use \nare unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated all of the trustworthiness concerns alleged in the \nSOR. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 3, 2022, and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on March 29, 2022.

Prior to working with his current employer, he worked with \nanother government contractor from June 2014 until October 2020. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Air Force from 1996 until 2006. He also served in the Air National \nGuard from 2006 until 2014. He was awarded an honorable discharge at the end of both \nterms of service.

(Items 3, 5) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes 20 delinquent debts totaling about $85,000 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.t). The SOR allegations are established through the 2021 credit report, \nhis 2021 background interview, and his admissions in his response to the SOR. (Items \n1-5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.q are Federal student loans that comprise the vast majority of the \naforementioned delinquent amounts. These Federal student loans are unresolved. \nApplicant admitted these SOR allegations, but claimed that in June 2021, he contacted \nthe Department of Education to set up an income-based repayment plan and the debts \nwill be in \u201cgood standing\u201d in nine months. Applicant claimed that he became delinquent \non his Federal student loans in February 2020. He stated that he was assisting his \ndaughter financially while she was attending college, had used all of his available \nforbearance and deferment extensions, and could not afford his student loan payments. \nHe did not provide specifics about how much money he provided his daughter, the \nlength of time that he was financially supporting her, or whether he continues to support \nher. He provided no evidence to show that he can now afford to pay his delinquent \nstudent loan debts or that he will be able to do so in the future. Moreover, Applicant \nprovided no documentation to support his assertion that he has attempted to resolve or \notherwise rehabilitate these debts. While neither party has provided evidence to this \neffect, I have taken administrative notice that all federal student loans were eligible for \nplacement in a deferment status as of late March 2020 at the earliest. Therefore, \navailable evidence shows that Applicant was delinquent on these debts prior to any \nplacement in a deferment status. (Items 1-5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r-1.t are medical debts totaling approximately $700. These debts are \nunresolved. While Applicant acknowledged these debts as being for his children\u2019s \nmedical services in his 2021 security interview, he denied these medical debts in his \nresponse to the SOR. He claimed that he contacted the collection agency and the \noriginal creditor, but they could not locate his accounts. He also claimed that he asked \nfor documents related to these medical debts from the collection agency, but that he \nhad not yet received any. Applicant did not provide any documentation establishing \nwhen he contacted creditors, or that the debts were disputed, paid, or otherwise \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nresolved. He also claimed that he became delinquent on the three medical debts listed \nin the SOR because he did not receive a bill for these medical services. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about his \nfinances is not available. Applicant is an active member of his church and has been \nentrusted with reviewing and maintaining financial and other personal information there. \nHe provided character reference letters from his supervisor at work and a religious \nofficial of his church attesting to his integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, and strong work \nethic. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. He has a history \nof unpaid debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nfederal-student-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe SOR debts are ongoing and therefore recent. Applicant acknowledged his \nstudent loan delinquencies, but failed to provide documentary evidence that he has \ntaken action to remedy those delinquencies, such as a completed application to \nrehabilitate his Federal student loans, or proof of payments. He also failed to provide \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims that he has paid, disputed, or otherwise \nresolved the three medical debts in the SOR. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to \npresent documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nApplicant stated that he intends to bring his student loan debts current and \nresolve his medical debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAs Applicant provided no evidence as to why he had to support his daughter \nfinancially, for how long, or the amount of money he spent, I am unable to find that his \nstudent loan delinquencies were beyond his control or that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances if they were. Given his lack of documentation of his efforts to resolve \nhis debts or the timing of these efforts, I cannot determine whether he made a good-\nfaith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his debts.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable and \nlengthy military service as well as his positive character references. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She was divorced in August 2018 and has one minor \nchild. She graduated from high school in June 1998. Applicant seeks eligibility to occupy \na position of public trust, because her employer and sponsor provides services to the \nDepartment of Defense, and her job would involve access to sensitive but unclassified \ninformation.

(SOR 1.c through 1.o) Applicant admitted these allegations. She \nalso disclosed on her SF 86 that she had filed for bankruptcy in the past. (Item 2) \nApplicant stated that her ex-husband had someone file tax returns but the preparer \n\u201chad them all messed up\u201d and she was fearful of filing. She stated that she is working with \na tax person to help her. As to the other delinquent debts, Applicant thought some had \nbeen paid through a garnishment of her wages, but she had no specific information. (Item \n2) She admitted that she has lost track of all the accounts in her name. (Item 3) \nApplicant attributed her financial issues to a divorce which left her with all the debt \nand bills that were only in her name. (Item 3) Some of the debts are old and she does not \nknow the account numbers to find the new creditors. She realizes that she has a bad \ncredit history but she believes she did her best. (Item 2) \nIn the 2020 subject interview, Applicant explained that her ex-husband owes \n$10,000 in child support and she is not able to address the past delinquent debts. \nApplicant has a special needs child and has many medical bills. She stated that she is \nembarrassed by the debts. However, as to the delinquent debt in SOR 1.l for $9,406, her \nex-husband has the vehicle but he is not making payments. She acknowledged that the \ndebt is on her credit report. (Item 3) Applicant also told the investigator that her ex-\nhusband used money from their checking account for his own needs and did not leave \nsufficient money in the checking account for Applicant to pay bills. (Item 3) \nApplicant lives with her mother and uses her mother\u2019s car so that she can survive. \nHer plan is to obtain a financial advisor or lawyer to address the tax filings and the \ndelinquent debts. At this time, she does not have the money to pay for professional help, \nbut she is current on her living expenses.

(Items 4,5) \nPolicies  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nDiscussion \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the \nconcern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe overall concern is stated in AG \u00b6 18: Failure to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nPotentially Disqualifying Factors \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b619 (f) failure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local \n\u2026\u2026 \nincome tax returns \u2026\u2026. \nPotentially Mitigating Factors \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nAuthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had problematic financial \nconditions that raise a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F. She appears to have \nbeen unable to satisfy her debts, and she has a history of not meeting her financial \nobligations. She has not filed her income tax returns for a number of years. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any of the mitigating conditions \napply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n   \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n__________________________________ \nThe debts that raised trustworthiness concerns were delinquent when the SOR \nwas issued in January 2022 and remained in arrears when the FORM was filed. Those \ndebts were neither infrequent, nor did they occur long ago. The Federal and state income \ntax returns have not been filed. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant enumerated a host of reasons that caused her dire financial straits. Her \ndivorce and child support issues are \u201cconditions . . . largely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s control. \nAG 20 (a)The inquiry under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, does not end there. Applicant must also \noffer proof of how she responded responsibly to the adverse circumstances she \nconfronted about her debts and non-filing of Federal and state tax returns. She has not \nprovided documentation in response to the SOR to support mitigation. Her pattern of \nfinancial irresponsibility precludes a finding that she has good judgment or reliability. \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant has a plan to work with a tax person, \nbut she has not yet made any arrangement with the appropriate tax authority to file the \nFederal or state tax retuns yet. AG \u00b619(g) does not apply. \nConclusion \nThe record creates doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and \n(d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not met her ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant \nher eligibility for access to sensitive information. \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n    Formal Findings\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility to hold a public trust position. \nNoreen A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline E (personal conduct), the SOR alleged that in May 2019, Applicant was disciplined for violating the terms of agreement for the travel credit card issued to him by his former employer (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline F (financial considerations), the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $23,774 for 14 past-due or delinquent debts (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.n). In response to the SOR, he admitted with explanation all of the allegations except for SOR 2.j. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following relevant findings of fact. Applicant is 51 years old and requires a security clearance in connection with his employment with a federal contractor, for whom he has worked since June 2020. He served in the U.S. Navy on active duty and as a reservist between August 1993 and May 2001, when he received an honorable discharge. He was married from June 1996 until divorcing in August 2019. With his ex-wife, he raised two children and one stepchild. In March 1993, he earned an associate\u2019s degree from a technical school, and he has worked in information technology (IT) and related jobs since then.

Based on the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) could not make an affirmative determination \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to continue \nto have access to classified information. Such a determination is required by Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as \namended (Directive), Section 4.2, \nOn April 1, 2022, the CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct and about his finances. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCAF adjudicators applied the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of \nNational Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, and effective for all adjudications on \nor after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On June 8, 2022, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) containing seven exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the \nGovernment relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on June 29, 2022, and he had 30 days from receipt \nof the FORM to submit additional information. He did not object to the Government\u2019s \ninformation or submit anything further in response. The record closed on July 29, 2022, \nand I received the case for decision on October 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline E (personal conduct), the SOR alleged that in May 2019, \nApplicant was disciplined for violating the terms of agreement for the travel credit card \nissued to him by his former employer (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations), the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $23,774 for 14 past-due or \ndelinquent debts (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.n). In response to the SOR, he admitted with explanation \nall of the allegations except for SOR 2.j. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following relevant findings of fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old and requires a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment with a federal contractor, for whom he has worked since June 2020. He \nserved in the U.S. Navy on active duty and as a reservist between August 1993 and May \n2001, when he received an honorable discharge. He was married from June 1996 until \ndivorcing in August 2019. With his ex-wife, he raised two children and one stepchild. In \nMarch 1993, he earned an associate\u2019s degree from a technical school, and he has worked \nin information technology (IT) and related jobs since then. He first received a security \nclearance in 1994. (FORM, Item 2) \nBetween 1995 and 2017, Applicant worked as a project manager for a federal \ncontractor. In February 2017, his company lost the contract to which he was assigned \nand laid him off as part of a reduction in force. Thereafter, he worked a series of full and \npart-time IT jobs until he started working for his current employer in 2020. One of those \njobs was a part-time, on-call position with a federal agency. In that position, he deployed \nin 2018 and 2019 to areas of the United States in response to natural disasters. To pay \nfor lodging, meals, and other costs incurred while traveling for that work, the agency \nprovided him with a government travel credit card (GTC). The card was in his name and \nhe was responsible for paying any balances using reimbursements from the sponsoring \nagency. \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in August 2020, he disclosed in Section 26 \n(Financial Record) that he had been disciplined for failing to pay about $6,000 that was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast due on his GTC. He explained that his failure to pay was due to a combination of \nexcessive and disputed charges on the card, financial problems related to his divorce, \nand his inability to find full-time employment that would pay him enough to meet his \nfinancial obligations. (Answer; GX 1) \nSOR 2.e alleged the GTC debt as a $2,599 charged-off account. Additionally, \navailable information in the form of credit bureau reports and Applicant\u2019s statements about \nhis finances he made in a personal subject interview on September 30, 2020, supports \nall of the SOR allegations. The credit reports p\n roduced by the Government show that he \naccrued delinquencies between October 2015 and October 2020. (Answer; FORM, Items \n1 \u2013 7) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant provided copies of emails between him and a \nfinancial management specialist at the federal agency for whom he worked regarding the \nGTC debt. That person helped administer the agency\u2019s travel card program. According to \nthose emails, the agency suspended his GTC for non-payment in May 2019 after the \nagency had warned him about his failure to pay off the card. It also advised him that the \ncard would remain suspended until he satisfied the debt and that he risked termination if \nhe did not do so. Applicant explained that he was having trouble finding work that paid a \nsufficient salary for him to pay the card and the expenses of his divorce, which had been \ngoing on for about a year at that point. He also wanted to have his pay garnished to satisfy \nthe debt, but was told he would have to arrange that directly with the credit card company. \nDuring his PSI, he alluded to those same circumstances as the cause of his financial \nproblems. He also stated his belief that his ex-wife was spending too much money \ntowards the end of their marriage. (Answer; FORM, Item 2) \nWith his Answer, Applicant also provided a copy of a repayment plan, dated April \n14, 2022, with the SOR 2.d creditor. According to that agreement, he would pay $200 \neach month for 12 months between May 2022 and April 2023 to satisfy that debt. \nApplicant averred he has started making those payments but he did not provide any \ncorroborating information. (Answer) \nApplicant did not provide any information showing he has acted to resolve any of \nthe other debts alleged in the SOR. He also did not provide any information about his \ncurrent monthly finances, or about any efforts to dispute the debts alleged. Finally, he has \nnot sought or obtained any professional financial counseling or assistance to resolve his \ndebts or to improve the way he manages his personal finances. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information supports the allegations that Applicant accumulated \nsignificant personal debt that has been past-due or delinquent since at least 2016. This \ninformation reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the following AG \n\u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent between 2015 and 2020. They are recent \nand ongoing because they have not been paid or otherwise resolved. By contrast, I also \nhave considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe record does not support any of these mitigating conditions. Although \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and employment problems may constitute unforeseeable or \nuncontrollable circumstances, it was incumbent upon Applicant to present information \nshowing that he acted responsibly in the wake of those circumstances and that his \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. He has not met that burden. He also has not \nsought any assistance in resolving his financial problems and he has not supported any \ndisputes he may have concerning the accuracy of the debts alleged. On balance, \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information \nabout his finances. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern raised through SOR 1.a, the lone allegation under Guideline \nE, is subsumed by the Guideline F allegation at SOR 2.e, in that, SOR 1.a alleges the \nunderlying cause of the GTC debt. Accrual of unresolved delinquent debts and other \nfinancial problems, such as those established in this case, may indicate poor judgment \nand reliability under both Guideline F and Guideline E. The SOR 1.a allegation of \ndisqualifying personal conduct is addressed under another adjudicative guideline as SOR \n2.e; thus, it does not fall within the ambit of the only potentially applicable Guideline E \ndisqualifying condition, namely, AG \u00b6 16(d): \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nI conclude that SOR 1.a duplicates the security concern raised by SOR 2.e. It is \nresolved for Applicant. \nApplicant did not meet his burden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s \ncase for disqualification from access to classified information under Guideline F. I also \nhave reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and his lack of any action to resolve any of \nthem until after he received the SOR, sustain doubts about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus in these \nadjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing access to \nsensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.n: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1  The DOHA database incorrectly indicates the case number is \u201c20-03574.\u201d \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.

On November \n12, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On November 29, 2021, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a Notice setting the hearing date for January 13, 2022. (Id.) \nHer hearing was held as scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the DOD \nMicrosoft Teams video teleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. \n(Tr. 12, 15-18; GE 1-GE 9) DOHA received a copy of the transcript on January 24, 2022. \nThe first suspense for providing post-hearing documents was February 15, 2022, and it \nwas subsequently extended to April 15, 2022. (Tr. 42, 45; HE 4) No post-hearing \ndocuments were received. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, \nand 1.j. (HE 3) She denied the other SOR allegations. She also provided mitigating \ninformation. (Id.) Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old multi-operations security specialist who has worked for \na defense contractor since May 2014. (Tr. 6, 19; GE 1) In 2001, she graduated from high \nschool. (Tr. 7) She received two associate\u2019s degrees in 2006 and 2010. (GE 9 at 2-3) In \n2012, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in social welfare. (Tr. 7) She has \nnever married, and she does not have any children. (Tr. 7) She served on active duty in \nthe Navy from 2001 to 2005, and in the Active Reserve until 2010 or 2011. (Tr. 8) She \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions because she was unable to \ncomplete the physical fitness assessment. (Tr. 8; GE 2) When she left the Navy, she was \na petty office second class (E-5). (Tr. 8) Her Navy rating was Avionics Technician. (Tr. 8) \nFinancial Considerations \nIn 2008, Applicant was working for a large defense contractor in security, and in \n2009, she was going to begin working in a position that required a security clearance, and \nshe did not receive an overtime-security position because of financial issues. (Tr. 21) Her \nfinancial problem in 2009 was due to the purchase of a new car, student loans, \nunemployment, underemployment and \u201cirresponsible spending.\u201d (Tr. 22) In 2017, \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 40; GE 2 at \n5) In 2018, she pleaded guilty to reckless driving, and the DUI was dismissed. (Tr. 40; GE \n2 at 5) The cost for her attorney, fees, fines, and costs related to the reckless driving \noffense totaled about $8,000 to $10,000.

(Tr. 40) Her annual pay has been about $82,000 for the past three years. (Tr. 19-\n20)   \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked in 2017 because \nof her finances. Her delinquent debts in 2015 to 2016 resulted when her sister and her \nniece moved in with Applicant, and then her sister lost her job. (Tr. 23-24) She was also \nmoved to a different position at work, and her income was reduced. (GE 9 at 3) On May \n15, 2015, she submitted an SCA, and on November 28, 2016, the DOD CAF issued an \nSOR alleging security concerns under Guideline F. On October 26, 2017, an \nadministrative judge issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-01155 (A.J. Oct. 26, 2017). The administrative judge said: \nApplicant admitted each of the 12 SOR allegations, including: a mortgage-\nloan account that was $3,995 past due with a total balance of $176,697 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $8,751 charged-off auto-loan account that was placed for \ncollection by a creditor who was later granted a $12,373 court judgment \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.k), five credit-card accounts in charge-off or collection \nstatus totaling $10,765 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i), a $10,653 \nfederal student-loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and two medical accounts totaling \n$946 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j) in collection status. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h through 1.j have been resolved.  \nWage garnishments were issued against Applicant to collect the auto-loan \nand the student-loan debts, in December 2014 and November 2015, \nrespectively. In her SOR answer, Applicant averred, without providing any \ncorroborating documentary evidence, that the garnishment for the auto-loan \ndebt would be satisfied in February 2017, and the student-loan debt in \nMarch 2017. One of Applicant\u2019s federal tax refunds was intercepted to \ncollect the student-loan debt. Another wage garnishment was issued and \nsatisfied in September 2014 to collect a $463 delinquent debt owed for an \nunspecified delinquent account (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant claimed, without providing any corroborating \ndocumentary evidence, that she was \u201con track with a repayment plan\u201d to get \ncaught up with her mortgage-loan payments, that she was adhering to the \nterms of the payment plans she arranged to resolve the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.g (the latter of which she expected would be completed \nin approximately March 2017). She intended to negotiate payment plans to \nresolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, and to pay the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i in December 2016. \nId. at 2-3 (footnotes omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $39,561 as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s $162,193 mortgage was past due in the amount of \n$9,032.

(Tr. 38) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant has a charged-off vehicle loan for $12,509. Applicant \nsaid she was making $250 monthly payments to address the debt. (Tr. 29) She did not \nprovide documentation showing her monthly payments or the current status of the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $1,044 and \u00b6 1.d alleges \na charged-off bank debt for $982. Applicant said both debts were paid, and she could \nprovide documentation showing payment. (Tr. 30-31) However, she did not provide post-\nhearing documentation showing payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off store debt for $534. Applicant said the debt was \npaid in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 31) Applicant\u2019s July 21, 2020 credit report shows a last activity \ndate of February 2016, and a status of settled for less than full balance. (GE 5 at 7) This \ndebt is resolved.

(Tr. 43)   \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h allege two federal student loans placed for collection for \n$2,495 and $5,097. Applicant said her student loans were paid through a garnishment. \n(Tr. 32) Applicant\u2019s October 29, 2021 credit report only includes one student loan for \n$6,068.

(Tr. 33) In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nDepartment of Education placed federal student loans in forbearance. On December 22, \n2021, the Department of Education extended the student loan payment pause through \nMay 1, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a \nsuspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted \nloans.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant described several circumstances beyond her control, which adversely \naffected her finances. Funds paid to assist family members, underemployment, \nfoundation problems for her residence, and unemployment of her sister. However, \u201c[e]ven \nif applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. She did not \nprove that she maintained contact with several of her creditors or that she made offers to \nmake partial payments to them. \nApplicant paid four debts through wage garnishments. Payment of a debt \u201cthough \ngarnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d Compare ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar \nmitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

I have credited Applicant \nwith mitigation of the signature loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f and her student loan debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h; however, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because she did not \nclearly establish that she voluntarily repaid these debts.

July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant did not establish that she was unable to make more documented \nprogress resolving her delinquent debts, especially in light of her failure to make mortgage \npayments over the last year. There is insufficient assurance that her financial problems \nare being resolved. Under all the circumstances, she failed to establish mitigation of \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old multi-operations security specialist who has worked for \na defense contractor since May 2014. In 2006 and 2010, she received two associate\u2019s \ndegrees. In 2012, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in social welfare. She \nserved on active duty in the Navy from 2001 to 2005, and in the Active Reserve until 2010 \nor 2011. She received a discharge under honorable conditions. When she left the Navy, \nshe was a petty office second class.

Her finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond her control. She mitigated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e through 1.h, and the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j.          \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why she was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving several delinquent debts. She has not made any \npayments on her mortgage for at least one year, except for one payment to start a \nmortgage modification. She did not provide proof of that mortgage payment. She is \nrepaying a loan from her 401(k) account, and may soon have to resume payments on her \nstudent loan. She did not provide documentary evidence showing she paid or settled \nseveral debts that she said she paid. Her financial history raises unmitigated questions \nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \n\u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of her past-due debt, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

(Items 6, and 7) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was not able to afford any \npayments and therefore the student loans became delinquent, defaulted and moved to \ncollections. He attributes his non-payment of the student loans due to unemployment \n(2010-2013) or seasonal jobs that did not pay well. (Item 2) In his response to DOHA \nfinancial interrogatories, dated April 22, 2021, none of the student loan accounts were \npaid, in payment plans, and no payments were being made. Applicant reported that he \nhad delinquencies involving the student loans but did not receive any information after \nthe loans went to collections. (Item 5) \nIn his personal subject interview in March 2021, Applicant listed unemployment \nfrom December 2018 to March 2019 and from April 2019 to November 2019. His \nspouse supported him during this time of unemployment. Applicant told the investigator \nthat he has no other financial issues. He has not obtained services from a credit \ncounseling service. He claimed that he was not delinquent on any federal debt or \ndefaulted on any other loans. (Item 4) \nApplicant stated that with his current job, he is able to start paying the debts. In a \nletter dated February, 18, 2022, from the U.S. Department of Education, he was notified \nthat he could rehabilitate his defaulted student loans with a monthly repayment mount of \n$354, which was based on his income. He accepted the agreement to repay beginning \nin April 2022. Applicant signed the agreement on February 25, 2022. (Item 2) Applicant \ndid not provide any information or documentation that he has started the payment plan. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly net salary combined with his spouse\u2019s salary is $6,743.92. \nAfter monthly expenses of $2,392, his net remainder is $4,023.56. In his submitted \nbudget he listed a car loan with a scheduled payment of $328.36.

He intends to pay his debts, but \npromises to pay in the future are not sufficient for mitigation. He is now earning a salary, \nbut his student loans have been delinquent since 2014, and it is not clear from the \nrecord if a single payment has been made. He claimed that the IRS took his tax refund, \nand applied it to his student loans, but he did not provide any proof. Absent any proof of \npayments, Applicant did not meet his burden of proof. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish disqualifying \nconditions under the guidelines: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he is responsible for his student loans and intends to pay \nthem. However, he did not present any evidence to support that he has acted \nresponsibly and in good-faith to repay his financial obligations, or has a meaningful \ntrack record of repayments. Based on the lack of evidence from Applicant, it is difficult \nto conclude that he has the requisite judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness needed to \nhave access to classified information. He has not met his burden and none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is married and has had periods of \nunemployment, but he has been consistently employed since 2019. He agreed to a \nrehabilitation program, but he did not provide any documentation concerning resolution \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nof his delinquent debt. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He has not met his burden of proof. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In so doing, the Government asked Applicant to provide admissions or \ndenials to the amended allegations in his response to the FORM. The Government also \nrequested that Applicant\u2019s silence be construed as denials in the event that he did not \nadmit or deny the amended allegations in his response to the FORM. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.r in his Answer, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s to \n1.z in his response to the FORM. He is 66 years old. He was previously married, the \ndates of which are not in the record, and he remarried in 2018. He has two adult \nchildren. As of his September 2021 background interview, he worked for his employer, a \nDOD contractor, since June 2018. He does not recall if he was granted a security \nclearance in 2010. As of his June 2021 security clearance application (SCA) and since \nDecember 2017, he lived in a home owned by his spouse. He previously owned a home \nfrom June 2006 to October 2016. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A) \nThe SOR and amended SOR alleged that Applicant had 18 delinquent consumer \ndebts, totaling $32,479 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.n-1.v, 1.x-1.z). It also alleged that he had 8 \ndelinquent medical debts, totaling $1,826 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.m, 1.w). In addition to his \nadmissions in his Answer, Applicant acknowledged in his SCA that he had financial \nissues. He also discussed his delinquent debts during his background interview. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.r, 1.w, and 1.z are reported on a June 2018 credit bureau report, and \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.s through 1.z are reported on a July 2021 \ncredit bureau report. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his separation and divorce; his period \nof unemployment from September 2017 to May 2018; and health issues. As indicated \nabove, the dates of Applicant\u2019s marriage, separation, and divorce were not in the \nrecord. He indicated during his background interview that he was required, through the \ndivorce, to pay the joint debts incurred during the marriage and provide $30,000 to his \nformer spouse so that he could keep the family home.

(Item 4; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. Applicant has a history of not paying his debts. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.p, and I find for him on those two debts. \nApplicant made one payment of $100 under the payment plan he entered into in \nApril 2022 for SOR \u00b6 1.c. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims \nof payment for any of his remaining debts. He did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate the basis for his dispute, or that he disputed, SOR \u00b6 1.u. While he \nrequested financial counseling through his EAP, he did not provide evidence that he \nreceived such counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), 20(d) and 20(e) are not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r - 1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a bank account in collection for $1,949. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted \nthis allegation. (Item 2.) This debt is not resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n          When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n         Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes the following conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to . . .  pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any of the \nfollowing mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable here: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n` \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances); and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe question is whether the quoted mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply on \nthese facts. Applicant\u2019s delinquent SOR debts are substantial and were not infrequent. \nThey persist to this day. Because of the frequency and recency of the debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not mitigate his debts. \nApplicant had a lengthy period of unemployment from June 2017 to May 2018. He \ncandidly gave the reason for his unemployment as being \u201cby mutual agreement following \nnotice of unsatisfactory performance.\u201d He attributed his financial problems to that loss of \nemployment. AG 20(b) requires that a loss of employment be \u201clargely beyond\u201d an \napplicant\u2019s control. Here, the reason for his loss of employment is ambiguous at best or \nunfavorable at worst. Beyond that, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that Applicant act responsibly \nunder the adverse circumstances he confronted. On this record, I cannot find that the \nconditions were largely beyond his control or that he acted responsibly about his finances. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate his debts. \nIn two instances, Applicant referred to a payment plan to resolve his tax \ndelinquencies. He did not, however, produce a documented plan or documents of \npayments made under such a plan. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it \nis reasonable to expect applicants to produce documentation supporting their \nefforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant has not satisfied that longstanding requirement. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not \nmitigate his debts. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.c.:  \n Conclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant answered the \nSOR the same day it was issued, and requested a decision based on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant on March 21, \n2022. He received the FORM on March 31, 2022, and was given 30 days after receipt \nof the FORM to raise objections, to submit evidence in extenuation and mitigation, and \nof his efforts to resolve his financial problems. He did not submit an answer to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included \nunauthenticated summaries of his July 2020 and October 2021, interviews with \ngovernment background investigators. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant was informed he could \nobject to the summary of his interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or \nthat he could make corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make \nit accurate. Applicant was informed that his failure to respond to the FORM or to raise \nany objections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence \nwould be considered. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. Without objections, I \nadmitted and considered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has nine charged-off accounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, \nand \u00b6 1.e through 1.j) totaling $78,428, and one account in collection (\u00b6 1.g, for $617), \nall totaling over $79,000. In his answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations, and made comments concerning some accounts. His admissions are \nhereby incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate. He attended a technology \ncollege between 2006 and 2007, but did not complete the program. He served in the\nU.S. Army as an enlisted member on active duty between October 2009 and April 2016.\nHe received an honorable discharge upon completion of his service obligation. He\nmarried in December 2011, and separated in November 2018. (Item 2) He has an eight-\nyear-old son. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that since his discharge from the Army, he \nhas been consistently employed with federal contractors. On his 2020 SCA, Applicant \nindicated that he submitted a prior SCA on an unknown date while in the Army, and he \nwas granted access to classified information at the top-secret level in 2010. In his \nresponses to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed having no financial problems, such as delinquent, in collection, or charged-off \nfinancial accounts. The subsequent background investigation revealed the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on July 6 and July 15, 2020. \n(Item 4) He was confronted with a number of delinquent financial accounts he failed to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisclose in his 2020 SCA. He told the investigator that he did not disclose some of the \naccounts because he had forgotten or was unaware of some of the accounts being \ndelinquent. Other accounts he was not sure what they were for, or whether they were \nhis accounts. He promised to investigate the accounts and make payment if they were \nhis accounts. Concerning other accounts, he claimed he had established monthly \npayment plans with the creditors and was making payments. \nThe investigator asked Applicant to submit documentary evidence to corroborate \nthe status of the delinquent accounts he was confronted with. Following his interview, \nApplicant failed to submit any documentary evidence to corroborate his claims about his \nefforts to contact his creditors, of any payment agreements established, or of any \npayments made to the creditors alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence with his response to the SOR, and he failed to respond to the \nFORM. \nApplicant told the investigator during his July 2020 interview, that his financial \nproblems started when he did not complete his college courses and the VA cancelled \nhis financial aid in 2018. He was immature and used the financial aid to pay some \ndebts. When the VA cancelled his financial aid, he became delinquent on some \naccounts and started to use credit cards to pay his debts and living expenses. He \nclaimed he was paying the smaller debts first, one at a time, and then moving on to \nother debts. His plan was to use his income tax refunds to pay his debts. To avoid \nrecurrence, Applicant intended to avoid using credit cards and purchase only \nnecessities using cash. Applicant claimed he was living within his financial means and \nhis current financial situation was stable. \nIn his February 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he was working on \nremoving the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($12,130) from his credit report. He implied \nhe was a class member on the ITT Student Loan Forgiveness Lawsuit, CFPB v. Peaks \nTrust, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. I take administrative \nnotice that the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) announced in August 2021 that it \nwould forgive student debt for more than 100,000 borrowers who attended colleges in \nthe now-defunct ITT Technical Institute chain, but left before graduating. The action will \noffer $1.1 billion in loan forgiveness to 115,000 borrowers who attended ITT Tech, \nwhich had more than 130 campuses across 38 states. Notwithstanding, Applicant failed \nto submit documentary evidence to show that he is a member of the protected class in \nthe lawsuit and that his student debt has been or will be forgiven. \nApplicant claimed he was trying to remove his name from the car loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($6,639), because it was his ex-wife\u2019s account. He averred the car was \nrepossessed after their separation in November 2018. I note that the credit reports in \nevidence show the account as a joint account. Applicant failed to submit documentary \nevidence to show this was his ex-wife\u2019s personal account, that he was not a joint owner \nof the account, and had no financial responsibility for it. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also claimed he was making payments on the account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h ($4,000). He failed to submit documentary evidence to show any payments made \non the account since December 2019, the \u201clast activity\u201d date on the account, based on \nthe October 2021 credit report. (Item 5) Concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($1,355) and 1.j ($755), \nhe explained he failed to complete some college courses and the VA initiated collection \nefforts to recover for overpayments it made to him. He failed to repay the overpayments \nand the accounts were charged off. Applicant claimed he paid part or all of the debts via \nan IRS income refund garnishment. He failed to present documentary evidence to \ncorroborate his payment claims. \nConcerning the remaining SOR accounts, Applicant stated in his February 2022 \nanswer to the SOR that he was \u201cworking on paying smaller debts first to create a \nsnowball effect and satisfy all debts.\u201d He failed to submit documentary evidence about \nhis efforts to contact his creditors, of any payment agreements established, and of any \npayments made to the creditors alleged in the SOR. The accounts alleged in the SOR \nare outstanding and unresolved. \nApplicant failed to submit sufficient documentary evidence about his efforts to \ncontact his creditors, of any payment agreements established, and of any payments \nmade to the creditors alleged in the SOR. He presented no evidence to show he has \nparticipated in financial counseling or has a working budget. Moreover, he did not \npresent evidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, child support, \ndeductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). Without any documentary \nevidence of his current financial situation, it is not possible for me to assess whether he \nis financially overextended. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information.

However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, he has nine charged-off accounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and \u00b6 1.e through 1.j) \ntotaling $78,428, and one account in collection (\u00b6 1.g, for $617), all totaling over \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$79,000. All of the SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, his \nstatements to an OPM investigator during his 2020 interviews, and the credit reports in \nevidence. The accounts alleged in the SOR are outstanding and unresolved. (FORM, \nItems 2, 4, 5, and 6) \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.c ($12,130), Applicant failed to submit documentary \nevidence to show that he is entitled to the student loan forgiveness, or that his student \ndebt has been or will be forgiven. He claimed SOR \u00b6 1.e ($6,639), was his ex-wife\u2019s \naccount. However, the credit reports in evidence show the account as a joint account. \nApplicant failed to submit documentary evidence to show this was his ex-wife\u2019s personal \naccount, that he was not a joint owner of the account, and had no financial responsibility \nfor it. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.h ($4,000), Applicant failed to submit documentary evidence \nto show any payments made on the account before or after December 2019, the \u201clast \nactivity\u201d date on the account, based on the October 2021 credit report. (Item 5) \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,355) and SOR \u00b6 1.j ($755), Applicant failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his claims that the IRS garnished some of his \nincome tax refunds and applied it to these two debts. As noted above, Applicant \npresented no documentary evidence of any good-faith efforts on his part to pay, settle, \nor resolve his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant enlisted in the Army and served eight years on active duty. Since his \n2016 discharge, he has been consistently employed by federal contractors. He \npresented no evidence of periods of unemployment or underemployment. He attributed \nhis financial problems to his immaturity and living beyond his means. He was using his \nstudent financial aid to supplement his income. The cancellation of his financial aid \nbecause of his failure to complete his college courses cannot be considered a \ncircumstance beyond his control. \nApplicant failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate his efforts to \ncontact his creditors, of any payment agreements established, or of any payments \nmade. He presented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or \nis following a budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial situation \n(gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). \nWithout any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not possible for \nme to assess whether or not he is financially overextended. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this case, Applicant failed to submit sufficient documentary \nevidence of his efforts to resolve his financial problems. Additionally, he presented no \nevidence to show he has participated in financial counseling. Moreover, he did not \npresent evidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, \nmonthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 35, honorably served eight years in the Army on active duty. He has \nbeen working for federal contractors since his discharge in 2016. Notwithstanding, his \nevidence is insufficient to establish that he has been financially responsible. He failed to \nestablish he has taken good-faith efforts to resolve his financial problems. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Army from January 2011 until January 2015, when he was \nhonorably discharged as a sergeant. He was granted a secret security clearance in \napproximately June 2011, and reapplied for a security clearance in August 2020.

At that time, he went on vacation to \na state in which recreational marijuana use is legal. He paid $50 for marijuana from a \nvendor and brought it home with him. At that time, all marijuana possession in his \nresidential state was illegal, including possession of marijuana for medical use, and \nmisdemeanor possession of marijuana for personal use could result in a $6,000 fine and \na one-year jail term. Following his vacation, he used the marijuana he had purchased one \nto two times a weekend, at home, by himself, before going to bed over the course of two \nto three weekends. Due, in part, to conflict with his wife, he disposed of the remainder of \nthe marijuana. His marijuana use caused strain in his marriage and was one of the \ncontributing factors of his 2020 divorce. As of the date of his interview, no one other than \nhis ex-wife is aware of his illegal marijuana use and possession, including his supervisor \nand security officer. (Item 4) \nWhen questioned regarding using marijuana while holding a security clearance, \nApplicant told investigator that he was aware that marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance was illegal. Additionally, he discontinued his use of marijuana, in part, due to \nbeing concerned that he would fail a work-place urinalysis. Marijuana use also caused \nhim to have paranoia, his heart to race, and he thought he was going to die. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2022 Answer to the SOR, he reiterated that he does not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. He used marijuana due to being at a low point in his \nlife.

(Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to possess and use marijuana, an illegal drug, multiple times, \nwhile holding a secret security clearance or granted access to classified information, \ncannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior that \nreflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security clearance decisions are \nnot limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty conduct, especially where it reflects \npoor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government to question an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. \nDepartment of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed \na disregard for the law, regulations, and the fiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered \ninto with the Government and his employer. \nIn August 2021, Applicant told the investigator in March 2019, he used marijuana, \nmultiple times, while holding a security clearance. He knew this use was against DOD \nsecurity policy, his possession of marijuana violated state and federal law, and he was \nconcerned he would be subjected to a workplace urinalysis. \nApplicant disclosed his illegal marijuana use in his 2020 SCA and during his \nAugust 2021 interview, and has indicated that he does not intend to use marijuana again \nin the future. However, he chose as a 39-year-old, married, father of three to purchase \nmarijuana and use it illegally to inappropriately deal with the stress in his life. His \nassertions that he has stopped using illegal drugs are insufficient to overcome the \nconcerns with respect to his past drug involvement while holding a security clearance or \nbeing granted access to classified information. At this time, he did not demonstrate a \nlengthy enough period of abstinence, given the circumstances under which he chose to \nuse marijuana. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, including his \nletters of recommendation. \nApplicant chose to use marijuana while working for his current employer and \nholding a secret security clearance or being granted access to classified information. \nThere has not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the concerns with his drug \ninvolvement. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did \nnot mitigate the drug involvement or substance misuse security concerns or establish his \neligibility to maintain a security clearance or be granted access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the four delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old information technology expert employed by a defense contractor. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1995 and has worked in the private sector since at least 2010. He married in August 1987, divorced in August 1989, and remarried in November 1989. He has six children, five of whom are adults and one is 15 years old. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1986 to December 1990 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while on active duty in the Navy and in August 1996 while working on a government contract. The SOR alleges four delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from February 2021 (FORM Item 5) and November 2021 (FORM Item 6). They are a bank loan charged off for $53,802 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a car debt charged off for $25,670 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a car debt charged off for $9,980 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and a telecommunications account referred for collection of $814 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). During Applicant\u2019s interview with a security investigator in April 2021, he attributed the delinquent bank loan to home projects and landscaping.

ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the four delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old information technology expert employed by a defense \ncontractor. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1995 and has worked in the private \nsector since at least 2010. He married in August 1987, divorced in August 1989, and \nremarried in November 1989. He has six children, five of whom are adults and one is 15 \nyears old. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1986 to \nDecember 1990 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while \non active duty in the Navy and in August 1996 while working on a government contract. \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from \nFebruary 2021 (FORM Item 5) and November 2021 (FORM Item 6). They are a bank loan \ncharged off for $53,802 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a car debt charged off for $25,670 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a \ncar debt charged off for $9,980 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and a telecommunications account referred \nfor collection of $814 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview with a security investigator in April 2021, he attributed \nthe delinquent bank loan to home projects and landscaping. He attributed the first \ndelinquent car debt to leasing a luxury car in April 2013 and the second car debt to leasing \nanother luxury car in December 2015. He voluntarily surrendered both cars when he was \nunable to afford the payments.

In his security interview in April 2021, he explained that this \ntravel occurred when he, his wife, their youngest daughter, and two cousins went on a \none-week cruise. (FORM Item 2 at 40; FORM Item 3 at 9.) \nApplicant has worked with a debt resolution agency to explore options for resolving \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The agency proposed three options: \nOption 1: Pay off all three debts in 48 months at $1,614 per month or in 53 months \nat $1,463 per month. \nOption 2: Pay off the bank loan in 30 months at $1,462 per month or in 53 months \nat $832 per month. \nOption 3: Pay off the two car debts in 30 months at $1,154 per month. \nApplicant decided that all three options were too expensive, and he contacted \nthree home mortgage lenders to explore refinancing his home and using his equity to pay \nthe three debts. When he responded to the FORM, he was scheduled to close on a \nrefinancing of his home on June 17, 2022. His monthly payments on the refinanced \nmortgage will be $5,834. (AX A at 11.) He provided no evidence of negotiations, \npayments, or payment agreements with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he was making monthly payments on the \ntelecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In his response to the FORM, he \nsubmitted evidence that the debt was paid in full. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a two-time cancer survivor. The record does not reflect when \nher first treatments occurred. The second series of treatments began in 2015. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to medical debts that were not covered by insurance. \n(FORM Item 3 at 1.) He did not provide any information about the amounts of the debts. \nIn response to DCSA interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial \nstatement dated September 15, 2021. He reported that he and his spouse had net \nmonthly income of $9,331; monthly expenses of $1,984; and one monthly payment of \n$3,584 on the refinanced home mortgage loan. He estimated his net monthly remainder \nas $3,762. \nAlthough Applicant has met his goal of refinancing his home, he has not provided \nany documentary evidence showing affordable payment agreements with the creditors \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Even if he reaches payment agreements, he will \nneed time to establish a track record of compliance with the agreements. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, frequent, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s uninsured medical debts were \nconditions largely beyond his control. However, he has not provided sufficient information \nto establish that the amounts of uninsured medical debts prevented him from meeting his \nother financial obligations. He also has not explained the relationship between his leases \nof expensive luxury cars, his vacation travel in 2018, and his inability to meet the financial \nobligations alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant has received financial counseling, but \nhis financial problems are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is not established \nfor the other debts alleged in the SOR. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation \nof an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection \nprocedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative \nguidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every \ndebt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). In this case, Applicant has taken some preliminary \nsteps to generate additional cash, but he has not yet arrived at a plan to resolve his \nremaining delinquent debts, nor has he taken significant actions to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance for a NATO Direct Hire position with the NCIA, in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has used and purchased marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about July 2006 to at least February 2022; that he has been arrested in \nMay 2018 for Possession of Marijuana, among other things; and that he intends to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future. Applicant admits each of the allegations with \nexplanations. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant explained that he has used marijuana over the years to treat symptoms \nof back pain and depression. This use has occurred on a weekly basis over the years. \nHe also stated that he plans to continue using marijuana in the future. (Government \nExhibit 6.) He stated that he would be willing to discontinue his marijuana use if that is \na requirement of his security clearance process. He does not believe that his use of \nmarijuana constitutes \u201cdrug abuse,\u201d and notes that marijuana is legal in the state where \nhe resides. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nIn May 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with Hashish-Possession \n(felony), Possession of Controlled Substance (felony), Marijuana Possession with Intent \n(felony), Marijuana Possession - More than 1 oz, less than 1 lb, Narcotic Equipment-\nPossession. Applicant admits the allegation. On this occasion, Applicant believes that \nthe search of his vehicle was illegal under the 4th amendment. He contends that his \npurchase of the substance was legal, and his use of the substance was personal and \nmedicinal. (Government Exhibit 7.) \nApplicant further notes that his purchases of marijuana have all been legal. He \nstated that he has always paid taxes on the marijuana he purchased. He has never \nbeen involved in any criminal distribution networks.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);    \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has deliberately used \nmarijuana for the past seventeen years, from 2006 to at least 2022. In May 2020, in his \neQIP, and again in February 2022, in responses to interrogatories, he stated his \nintention was to continue to use marijuana in the future. Marijuana is illegal under \nFederal law, and is clearly prohibited by the DoD under any circumstances. Applicant\u2019s \nactions are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant is a 37-year-old man. He has \nnot demonstrated the level of maturity needed in order to access classified information. \nApplicant should know the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand should know that marijuana use is against Federal law and not tolerated. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident \nto know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even \nwhen no one is looking. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security \nclearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The FORM notified Applicant that she had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of it. She received the FORM on June 28, 2022 and timely \nsubmitted additional information that I marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A.

She denied \nthree alleged student loans because she said she no longer owes them to the alleged \ncreditor, as they were transferred to the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd) in \nNovember 2021 and are current. (Item 2) Her admission and explanations are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old and unmarried. She does not have children. She attended \ncollege but has not yet completed a degree. She has worked for a federal contractor since \nSeptember 2010 and received a Secret clearance in 2011. In January 2021, she \nsubmitted a security clearance application (SCA) for renewal of her clearance. Since that \ndate, she has also been working a second job at a retail store. (Item 3) In March 2021, a \ngovernment investigator interviewed her about her finances. (Item 4) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to medical problems that started in \n2011. She also said she has not been earning enough income to pay her debts over the \nyears, including student loans. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7) She submitted her January 2022 \nbudget. Her net monthly income is $2,588 and her monthly expenses equal her income. \n(AE at 3, 5, 7) She did not indicate that she has taken budget or credit counseling. \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoEd placed all federal \nstudent loans in forbearance and has since extended the student loan payment pause \nthrough December 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible \nloans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collection on \ndefaulted loans. (See Federal Student Aid: https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19.) \nOn November 10, 2021, the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd) transferred \nthree student loans Applicant owed to GM to DoEd. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion in \nher Answer that these student loans are the three student loans alleged in the SOR, these \nloans were not alleged in the SOR. They are additional student loans owed by Applicant. \nIn its notice to Applicant of the transfer, DoEd stated that Applicant\u2019s current balance on \none transferred loan was $43,535 with an outstanding interest balance of $311. On \nNovember 10, 2021, DoEd also notified Applicant that the current balance on another \ntransferred loan was $22,740 with an outstanding interest balance of $155. (Item 2 at 4, \n5) These two loans total $66,275.

Applicant said she was having medical problems at \nthe time of the loan and did not earn enough money to pay her debts.

(Item 4) The February 2021 CBR verifies \nthat some of Applicant\u2019s debts are current and in good standing. (Item 6 at 7, 8) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not flexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in \nAG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of being unable to satisfy her debts, in particular, three \nstudent loans, which became delinquent in 2017 and 2019, and have not been addressed. \nShe spends all of her monthly income on current living expenses, leaving no funds \navailable to address her large student loan debt. She also has two small old medical bills \nthat are unresolved. All SOR-alleged debts are documented by two credit reports. These \nfacts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant argues that the three alleged student loans are current because they \nwere transferred to DoEd and are in federal deferment status. While that pause may affect \nthe payment status of the three loans, it does not mitigate the debts because they were \ndelinquent prior to March 2020, and she did not present evidence that she had taken \nsteps to establish payment plans before that date. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2021)(noting student loans totaling about $20,000 that were delinquent \nbefore the COVID-19 federal deferment may be the basis for revocation of access to \nclassified information.) \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, totaling $77,497, are recent and ongoing. She failed \nto establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Her health problems and underemployment over \nthe past years have been circumstances beyond her control; however, she did not present \nevidence that she attempted to responsibly manage her debts while they were \naccumulating, beginning in at least 2017. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.

There are no clear indications that any of the \nother five alleged debts are being resolved through payment plans or are under control. \nThere is no evidence that she sought credit or budget counseling, or that she had initiated \npayment plans on the $76,456 student loan debt prior to the COVID-19 pause in \npayments. She has not addressed two small medical debts alleged in the SOR: one \nbecame delinquent in August 2017, and the other became delinquent in November 2020. \nThe record establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for the jewelry debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. The record does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d) for the other five \nalleged debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. According to Applicant, she has \nbeen experiencing health problems since 2011 and underemployment for a long period. \nAccording to her February 2021 CBR, she is current with some ongoing expenses. \nHowever, one large alleged student loan has been delinquent since 2017, and another \ntwo loans since 2019. None of them were addressed prior to the March 2020 federal \ndeferment, or subsequent to it. During her interview in March 2021, she said that she \nwould investigate and resolve two old small medical debts that total $121. They remain \nunresolved. \nThe evidence raises concerns that Applicant does not have a clear understanding \nof the number or amount of student loans she owes. The SOR alleged she owes over \n$76,000 for three delinquent loans, and the two other loans transferred to DoEd in \nNovember 2021 total over $66,000. According to this record, she owes approximately \n$142,000 in student loans.

The SOR debts were reported delinquent in a \nSeptember 2020 credit report. (Item 5.) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts either charged off, in collection, or past due \ntotaling $26,172 (including past due mortgage account). (Item 1.) The SOR debts are \nsupported by the record. (Items 4 and 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is credit card account that has been charged off in the amount of \n$8,254. Applicant admitted this debt, stating: \u201cI sent [sic] up a payment plan and issue will \nbe resolved by June 29, 2022.\u201d (Item 2.) She updated her Answer and added that as a \nresult of a settlement, this debt will be resolved by June 29, 2022. (Response.) She did \nnot provide any documents in support of her Answer or Response. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a credit card account charged off in the amount of $7,900. Applicant \nadmitted this debt, stating: \u201cI notified the bank in April 2022 that I will set up a 2-month \npayment plan to resolve the delinquency beginning on July 29, 2022.\u201d (Item 2.) Applicant \nupdated her Answer and added that as a result of the 2-month payment plan, this debt \nwill be resolved by July 29, 2022. (Response.) She did not provide any documents in \nsupport of her Answer or Response. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a consumer account in collection in the amount of $1,814. Applicant \nadmitted this debt, stating: \u201cI set up payment plan and issue will be resolved by April 30, \n2022.\u201d (Item 2.)

She did not provide any documents in support of her \nAnswer or Response. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is home mortgage account that is past due in the amount of $8,003 \nwith a total balance of $344,577. Applicant admitted this debt, stating: \u201cI requested a new \npayment due date from [mortgagee] to align with salary deposits. This should remedy the \ndelinquency going forward. Payments of $5,200 will be reflected on mortgage statement \nby April 15, 2022. Current balance is $335,798.96.\u201d (Item 2.) Applicant updated her \nAnswer and added that a new payment schedule has been set, to which she has \ncomplied. (Response.) She did not provide any documents in support of her Answer or \nResponse. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and,  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay    \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe SOR debts have been reported delinquent since at least September 2020 and \nhave remained delinquent. The inception of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies is not that long \nago. And since then, the SOR debts have remained delinquent.

She knew in October 2019 when she completed her \nSCA that delinquent financial accounts were material to her eligibility for a national \nsecurity clearance. Yet even with that knowledge, she took no action until the issuance \nof the SOR unmistakably jeopardized her security clearance. Her delinquent debts are \nnot mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nThe record shows that two circumstances contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties in 2018, her expensive elective medical procedure and her husband being laid \noff \u201cfor \u201cseveral months.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b) may apply. The triggering events must be \u201clargely \nbeyond [an applicant\u2019s] control.\u201d Applicant did not characterize her expensive elective \nmedical procedure as an \u201cemergency.\u201d Therefore, it was not largely beyond her control \nwithin the contemplation of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe lay-off of Applicant\u2019s husband, however, fits squarely within the language of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (loss of employment). But that does not end the inquiry.  Applicant must then \nshow that she acted responsibly in the face of those adverse circumstances. Given the \ndiscussion under AG \u00b6 20(a), she did not do so. Only the issuance of the SOR spurred \nher into action to resolve her debts. That is not responsible conduct. Her delinquent debts \nare not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) needs to be considered, because a number of Applicant\u2019s Answers \nand Responses speak of setting up payment plans with creditors and some debts being \nsettled, or paid in full. There is no reason to doubt those assertions, but they come \u201ctoo \nlittle, too late.\u201d The conclusion is inescapable that the issuance of the SOR motivated \nApplicant to address her delinquent debts. This is not considered to be a good faith \nresolution of debts. I find that AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply (lack of good faith). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \nOne final infirmity is that Applicant failed to provide any documents in support of \nher Answer or her Response. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable \nto expect applicants to produce documentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 e.:  \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n AGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.
