In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness to numerous creditors The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute her financial difficulties to medical issues and to \nperiods of unemployment, her financial problems are ongoing. She has only addressed \ntwo of the admitted past-due debts. She has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e.~1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2019. The Defense \n\n \n2 \n \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 25, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 17, 2020. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nThere were no objections to any of the exhibits offered, and they were admitted into \nevidence. The record was held open until February 7, 2020, to permit Applicant to provide \nadditional exhibits. He did not provide any additional exhibits, and the record closed. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on January 28, 2020.  \n \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR (HE I; Tr. 10) by adding the \nfollowing: \n \n1.f: You are indebted to the State of [X] for a tax lien entered against you in \nDecember 2018 in the approximate amount of $1,448.00. As of the date of \nthe Statement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid. \n \n1.g: You are indebted to [Bank Group] for a judgment entered against you \nin December 2011 in the approximate amount of $450,633.  \n \n \nApplicant did not object to the Government\u2019s motion to amend. Applicant requested \nthat the record be held open to permit the submission of additional exhibits. The \nGovernment\u2019s motion was granted. Applicant\u2019s request that the record be held open was \nalso granted.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit II, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about India. Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is \nIndia\u2019s significant involvement in economic and industrial espionage, numerous criminal \ncases concerning export enforcement, and threats of terrorism and insurgent activities \nthat may affect U.S. citizens, as well as ongoing human rights problems.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through 1.e, and 2.a. \nHe denied the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He was born in India and immigrated to the United States \nin 1988. He married in India in 1989 and his wife immigrated the same year. He became \na naturalized citizen in 2000. His wife is also a naturalized citizen, but the year is unknown. \nThey have three children who were born in the United States and are ages 28, 27, and \n\n \n3 \n \n \n19. They all live at home. Applicant has worked at his current job since May 2013. He is \nseeking employment with a government contractor and has been affiliated with them \nsince November 2017. (Tr. 21-22, 90-92; GE 1) \n \nApplicant testified that he worked for different employers from 1989 until \napproximately 2009 when he was laid off when the program he was responsible for was \nshut down. He testified that from 2009 to 2013 he worked as an on-call contractor, and \nhis work was sporadic, and his income was significantly reduced. (Tr. 28, 57-58; GE 1) \n \nApplicant explained that at the time he was laid off his wife was employed. They \nwere able to pay their bills for a period, but decided to prioritize their children\u2019s college \neducation. He had a mortgage on his home with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant had \npurchased the house in 2001 and consistently made payments and additional payments \ntoward the principal. Applicant testified that in 2009 or 2010, he obtained a home equity \nloan from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The exact amount is unknown. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$157,805; \nAE A) He used the home equity loan to stay afloat during his financial hardship and paid \nhis creditors, including credit cards, car loans, tuition, his son\u2019s student loans, and other \nexpenses that were due. (Tr. 32-39, 58 \n \nSubsequent to his unemployment, Applicant began to fall behind on his mortgage \npayments. Applicant told the government investigator during his December 2017 \nbackground investigation, that he attempted to refinance his mortgage, but after a period \nhe told the mortgagee to foreclose on the property because the process had not been \ncompleted, and he planned to move to a new state for a job. He and his wife were both \noffered jobs and a relocation allowance. Regarding the home equity loan, he told the \ninvestigator that he paid $300 a month on the loan until he lost his job. He said the creditor \ntold him to wait until the foreclosure was resolved before addressing this debt. He told the \ninvestigator the home equity loan owed was resolved. He moved in March 2013. (Tr. 39-\n43; GE 2) \n \nApplicant provided a copy of the Judgment for Foreclosure and Sale (Judgment) \nfor his house filed in December 2014. It is unsigned. The total amount owed including all \nrelated fees and interest on the original mortgage was $122,088. The Judgment notes \nthat if the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to satisfy those sums due the Plaintiff, \nthe Court shall enter a deficiency judgment. Applicant testified that he does not know if \nthe house was sold, and he has not received any notice of a deficiency judgment. \nAttached to the Judgment is an \u201cAffidavit of Prove-Up.\u201d The plaintiff is the original \nmortgage company and the defendants include Applicant, his wife, and the creditor \nApplicant received his line-of-credit loan from (SOR \u00b6 1.a) among others. The affidavit \nnotes that the line-of-credit is a second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s house which was \nconveyed in 2007. The document further showed that the balance due and owed on that \nmortgage through March 2014 with fees and court costs was $212,876. (Tr. 40-43; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence as to whether there was a deficiency balance \non the first mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and the current status or resolution of the second \nmortgage as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is unresolved.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,564) is a credit card debt. Applicant testified that his \ncredit card was fraudulently used, and he was a victim of identity theft. He stated he \ndisputed the charges with the creditor, and it was resolved in May 2016. Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2017 credit report shows the debt was charged off in March 2016. A judgment \nwas entered for the creditor of this account in July 2016. Applicant did not provide any \nevidence of his dispute or that the debt was resolved. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 79-81; \nGE 1, 2, 4, 8) \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($19,558) is a credit card debt. Applicant stated the debt \nbelongs to his wife. His March 2017 credit report shows it belongs to him. He testified he \npaid it for a period and then it was charged off. He did not provide any documents to show \nhe is not responsible for the debt or has taken action to resolve it. (Tr. 47-50, 81-83; GE \n2, 4, 5) \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($5,784) is for a personal loan that Applicant cosigned for \na friend. His friend made the required payments for a period and then stopped. Applicant \nmade small payments for a period and then stopped. Applicant testified that the debt was \ncharged off. He has not provided evidence that he has resolved the debt. (Tr. 47-51; GE \n2, 4, 5).  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was unaware of a tax lien entered against him from State \nX, where he previously lived and owned a house. The tax lien was entered in December \n2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.f; $1,448) Applicant did not provide evidence of any attempt he may have \nmade to contact State A, pay, or resolve the tax lien. (Tr. 83-89; GE 6) \n \n \nThe Government provided evidence of a judgment and lien for Bank Group entered \nagainst Applicant, his wife, and two other debtors in State X. It was filed in December \n2011 in the amount of $450,633. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) Applicant testified that he invested $150,000 \nin gas stations in 2008 or 2009. He said he was a board member of the corporation and \na silent partner and not liable. No evidence was provided by Applicant to show he has \nresolved this judgment. (Tr. 62-76; GE 7)  \n \n \nApplicant was asked where he got the money to invest in gas stations. He stated \nthat he inherited about $450,000 from his father in about 2008 or 2009. He gave his \nbrother $300,000 because India would not let him transfer the entire amount from the \ncountry. During his background interview, he told the investigator that his investment in \ngas stations occurred in 1995 and the venture ended in 2003 or 2004. Applicant provided \nconfusing and contradictory testimony. (Tr. 62-78; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in 2013, he inherited $300,000. It is unknown if he received \na second inheritance from his mother. He made several trips to India to dispose of her \nproperty during this period. He stated that he brought some of the money back to the \nUnited States and gave some to his two daughters, paid off his car loans, and paid other \nthings. It is unknown whether the two amounts of $450,000 and $300,000 are the same \ninheritance and there is a discrepancy in the amount or if they are two separate amounts \nhe inherited. (Tr. 62-78) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he moved from State X in 2013. He purchased a house in \nthe new state where he was employed. The purchase price was $168,000, and he said it \nwas \u201cowner financed.\u201d Having recently left State X and moved to a new state, it is \nunknown where Applicant got the money to purchase a house in the new state. He sold \nthis house in 2015 and purchased another house for $355,000. He currently has about \n$17,000 in savings; $35,000 in a 401k pension plan; and $35,000 in stock market \ninvestments. His wife has about $55,000 in her 401k pension plan and about $35,000 in \nstock market investments. He and his wife both lease 2018 vehicles and have two other \ncars for their children. Applicant currently earns about $80,000 annually, and his wife \nearns about $85,000 annually. Applicant pays his younger son\u2019s tuition, car note, and \nliving expenses. His other children have 2015 vehicles that were paid for by Applicant. \n(Tr. 93-97) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He has five brothers and four sisters. One sister \npassed away. One sister lives in the United States. Three of his brothers are citizens of \nthe United States. The other two are citizens and residents of India. One is a retired \nchemist, and the other is a retired engineer. Both previously worked in private industry \nbefore retiring. All four of his sisters are residents and citizens of India. They all are \nmarried and homemakers. None of his siblings in India have ties to the government. \nApplicant visits his relatives in India regularly. Applicant does not have any financial ties \nto India. (Tr. 23-28, 54; GE 1, 3) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA and in his Counterintelligence Focused Security \nScreening Questionnaire (CFSSQ) that from August 2010 through September 2014, he \ntraveled to the Philippines as a tourist or to visit family and friends ten times. The trips \nlasted from a few days to a month. He financed the trip himself and his family did not \naccompany him. From December 1989 to September 2016, he traveled to India to visit \nfamily and friends 13 times. He financed the trips himself and he took his wife, daughter \nand two sons with him twice. During one of these trips he and his family also visited \nThailand. His last trip to India was in January 2019. Applicant traveled to Thailand in \nAugust 2012 by himself as a tourist. He traveled to the United Arab Emirates as a tourist \nin September 2016. Applicant testified that he travels to India once every three or four \nyears, which is inconsistent with information he provided in his CFSSQ and SCA. He \ntestified that his friend in the Philippines finances his trips there, which is inconsistent with \nhis CFSSQ disclosures. (Tr. 55-62, 90; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n7 \n \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism, ongoing human rights problems, and \nindustrial espionage in India. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nand coercion. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by \nthe evidence.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has five brothers and three sisters. Three brothers are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. Two brothers and three sisters are citizens and residents \nof India. He visits India regularly and presumably his family there. Applicant gave one \nbrother $300,000 of Applicant\u2019s inheritance. His contact is not casual or infrequent. AG \u00b6 \n8(c) does not apply.  \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to India. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers and three sisters are citizens and residents of India. Both \nbrothers are retired and his sisters are homemakers. There is no evidence that they are \ninvolved in government activities or work for the government. Applicant\u2019s ties to the United \nStates are more significant. He has been a naturalized citizen since 2000. His wife is also \na naturalized citizen. His children were born and educated in the United States. Applicant \nhas financial interests in the United States. Although, he frequently visits India, due to the \nnature of its government and his relatives\u2019 contact with it, the possibility that Applicant\u2019s \nfamily could be used to manipulate or coerce him is minimal. There is sufficient evidence \nto find that it is unlikely Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) \napplies.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationship and loyalty to the United \nand his connections to the United States taken together are sufficient to fully overcome \nand mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n9 \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has numerous unresolved delinquent debts and judgments. He is unable \nor unwilling to pay the accounts he owes. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant has numerous unresolved delinquent debts and judgments beginning as \nearly as 2011. He failed to provide evidence that he has taken action to pay or resolve \nany of the debts or judgments. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He attributed his delinquent \ndebts to a period of unemployment beginning in around 2009 or 2010 when he was laid \noff from his job. This was beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant used a home \nequity loan to pay for his children\u2019s education, car loans, and other expenses. He failed \nto provide evidence that the home equity loan was paid or resolved through his home\u2019s \nforeclosure. During the period when Applicant said he was unemployed or unable to pay \nhis debts, he made frequent trips to foreign countries that he paid for. It appears when \nApplicant moved to a new state, he abandoned his financial responsibilities in the state \nhe left. He has a $460,633 judgment from 2011 in State X that he has not addressed. He \nsaid he disputed certain debts that were charged off, but failed to provide evidence to \nsubstantiate his claim or actions to resolve the issues. Applicant has been employed since \n2013 and continued to travel extensively, but not pay his delinquent debts or judgments. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his siblings who are citizens \nand residents of India. He has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Applicant has not provided evidence of any action he may have taken to \naddress the delinquent debts and judgments alleged. It appears he had the financial \n\n \n11 \n \n \nresources to travel extensively over the past years, but not resolve his delinquent debts \nand judgments. He moved in 2013 to a new state and has been employed since then. He \nprovided insufficient evidence to substantiate his disputes that he is not responsible for \nmany of his debts and judgments. He also failed to provide evidence of his intentions to \nsatisfy and resolve them. Applicant did not meet his burden of persuasion and provide \nsufficient evidence in mitigation. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence, but failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 11, \n2018. On June 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) \nand J (Criminal Conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on July 12, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 1, 2019. On October 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 20, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through C \nwere admitted without objection, and Applicant testified. I received the complete transcript \n(Tr.) on December 4, 2019. The record was held open until January 8, 2020, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. She was given a continuance until January \n30, 2020, but she did not submit additional documentation, and the record closed. \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, 40, is single and has three daughters aged 21, 19, and 14. She \ngraduated from high school in 1998 and attended a technical school, but did not receive \na certificate or degree. She previously worked for defense contractors from 2011 to 2014 \nand held a secret security clearance. Since April 2018, she has worked for a defense \ncontractor as an air craft painter. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 10-13, 21-23, 28-32 \n \n \nApplicant has fifteen alleged debts totaling $24,818. In her most recent credit \nbureau report from August 2019, there are three new unalleged delinquent debts. \nApplicant fell behind on her financial obligations due to working at jobs where she was \nunderemployed, and she was caring for her children as a single parent. Several of her \ndebts are delinquent medical bills. Applicant\u2019s oldest two daughters are in college; \nhowever, she received irregular child support from their fathers when they were young. \nShe receives child support for her youngest daughter. (GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 21-23, 29, 84-86)\n \n                    \n \nIn approximately 2015, a former co-worker and now ex-friend agreed to help \nApplicant move furniture. She paid for the rental truck, and the rental agreement was in \nher name. Applicant\u2019s ex-friend asked a friend of his to help with the move, and they drove \nthe rental truck together. While they were driving the truck, they rear-ended Applicant, \nwho was in her personal vehicle with her middle daughter. Immediately after the accident, \nApplicant called the police, and they came to the scene of the accident. The driver of the \ntruck was given two tickets. Additionally, she reported the accident to her insurance \ncompany and the rental company. Ultimately, she paid $500 out of her own pocket to pay \nfor the repairs for her vehicle and received no money from her insurance company. \nApplicant was arrested in October 2016, and charged with felony forgery and four counts \nof felony insurance fraud related to the 2015 incident. She plead not guilty. In September \n2017, the charges were dismissed, but other related charges were filed against her. In \n2018, the case was continued, and since then she has not heard from the court. The \nhearing record was left open, in part, to allow Applicant to submit documentation and \nclarification as to the status of the pending charges. (Answer at 4-8; GE 1; GE 2 at 2; Tr. \n34-52) \n \n \nApplicant hired a credit-counseling company in July 2019, after receiving the SOR. \nThe record evidence indicates the total debt being addressed by the credit-counseling \ncompany is $8,615, which includes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.k-1.o. She made an initial payment \nof $147 in July 2019. She set up biweekly payments of $132 to be deducted from her \nchecking account. She did not provide proof of these payments at or after the hearing. \nAccording to Applicant, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.p are also being addressed \nthrough this service, but the documentation she provided does not substantiate her \nclaims. (Answer at 1-3, 10-30; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 52-56, 63-65, 67-73, 89-90) \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant was in an accident and her vehicle was totaled. In her response \nto the SOR she asserted that the $14,364 debt, alleged as SOR \u00b61.f, that stemmed from \nher accident was resolved. She testified that her insurance covered the majority of the \noutstanding balance; however, she did not have gap insurance, and the remaining \nbalance is $2,442. The collection agency contacted her approximately one month before \n\n \n3 \n \nthe hearing, and she set up a settlement agreement to make automatic-biweekly \npayments of $47 and pay a total of $1,000. The first payment was scheduled for the week \nafter the hearing; however, she provided no substantiating documentation at or after the \nhearing to demonstrate that she has made payments toward this debt. (Answer at 2; GE \n3 at 2-3; GE 4 at 2-3; Tr. 57-63) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h through 1.m are medical debts totaling $706. Many of these debts \nwere for her children. She had health insurance but could not afford the co-pays or \nemergency room bills. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.m are included in the credit-counseling agreement, \nbut she provided no proof of payments other than a July 2019 payment of $147. In her \nresponse to the SOR, she claimed that she was working to settle and resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h-1.j; however, she failed to provide proof of payment or settlement agreements. \n(Answer; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 72-75) \n  \n \nThe credit-counseling company helped Applicant create a written budget last \nsummer. She testified that she is up-to-date on her rent, utilities, car payment, and state \nand federal income taxes. However, Applicant\u2019s August 2019 credit bureau report reflects \n3 new unalleged delinquent debts totaling $2,737. (Tr. 26-28, 33, 92)  \n \n \nIn October 2019, Applicant made a $400 payment toward an unalleged and \nunreported medical debt. Additionally, she has been voluntarily working 16 to 24 hours of \novertime each week to better her financial situation. (Answer at 21; AE C; Tr. 18-19, 76-\n80) Applicant provided three letters of recommendations. He supervisor described her as \ndependable, proficient, hardworking, and positive. Her other character letters describe \nher as a valuable member of the community, reliable, and a consistent performer. \nAdditionally, Applicant is involved in her daughter\u2019s school and hosts events to support \nvarious programs. (Answer at 9; AE A; AE C; Tr. 17-18) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n4 \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n\n \n5 \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant struggled financially due to underemployment and a lack of child support \nfor two of her children. She recently initiated repayment of her delinquent debts through \na credit-counseling program and by directly working with several of her creditors. \nHowever, she failed to provide documentation to support her claims of payment; \ntherefore, there is no clear indication that her delinquent debts are being resolved, nor is \nthere evidence of a good-faith effort to repay or resolve her debts. Finally, Applicant\u2019s \nmost recent credit report reflects new unalleged delinquent debts. Based upon the totality \nof the record evidence, Applicant has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(c), 20(d), and 20(e). \n  \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s pending criminal charges establishes one \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n (b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this \ncase. The following two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she did not commit insurance fraud or forgery in 2015. \nHowever, given the seriousness of the charges and because they are still pending, \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my \nwhole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nI conclude Applicant has not met her burden of proof and persuasion. She did not \nmitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns or establish \nher eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.y: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2019, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Administrative Guidelines (AG) \nimplemented on June 8, 2017, the DoD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. (DOHA) The case was assigned \nto me on January 6, 2020. On February 4, 2020, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the \nhearing for February 28, 2020. The hearing convened as scheduled.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits (AE) A through C, which were marked and admitted into the record without \nobjection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open after the hearing to allow him the \nopportunity to submit additional information. He timely submitted documents that I marked \nas AE D and E and admitted without objection. The transcript was received on March 9, \n2020. The record closed on March 31, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 62, is married and has three adult children. He served in the U.S. \nNavy for 23 years, retiring in 2001. He obtained his undergraduate degree in 2009 and \nreceived his master\u2019s degree in the same year. (Tr. 18) Applicant completed his most \nrecent security clearance application on July 3, 2016. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1978. He has been employed as a contractor for about 20 years. Applicant has \nbeen employed with his current employer since 2000 as a program manager. (GE 1) \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for past- \ndue income taxes for tax years 2009 through 2017 for a total amount of $195,720. (1.a-\n1.h.)  Applicant admitted those SOR allegations but disputed the total amounts due. . The \nSOR further alleges that Applicant has a past-due mortgage account in the amount of \n$10,951 and two collection student loan accounts. (1.i-1.k) Finally, allegation 1.l reflects \na judgment placed in 2017 in the amount of $7,733. \n \nApplicant acknowledged the Federal tax debt, but presented documentation that, \nas of February 2020, the amount due is approximately $71,417.79. (AE B) He stated that \nhe is working with a tax attorney to establish a repayment plan. The tentative start date \nof the plan is March 28, 2020. The terms are $1,440 a month for the first year, to increase \nto $2,375 a month thereafter. (AE B)  Applicant contacted a tax relief company in 2006 \nand entered various installment plans, but never maintained them. He stated that in 2009 \nhe was in a repayment plan, but he stopped making payments after his wife was laid off \nfrom her job. (Tr. 23) In total, Applicant had made about six payments. In 2012, after the \nGovernment issued tax liens against him, he made a $1,200 payment. He made no \npayments in 2013, but he started another installment plan in February 2014. (Tr. 23) He \nmade one payment in 2016 for $300 and a few payments in 2018. There is no record \nevidence of any other voluntary payments. His income and his wife\u2019s income during these \ntaxable years averaged about $200,000 annually. (Tr. 26) Applicant\u2019s Navy retirement \npay has been garnished since 2019 in the amount of $400 a paycheck. (Tr. 21) \n \nApplicant believes his tax problems started in about 2006 when he received a \n$19,000 tax refund the previous year. (Tr. 14) His wife was not working and he believed \nthat there was some issue concerning a mortgage company overcharging on interest. He \nstated that after that, because he never had owed taxes, he did not file future returns. He \nnow admits that he used poor judgment. (Tr. 35) He disclosed his tax issues on his \nsecurity clearance application. Apparently he filed tax returns in 2010 and learned how \nmuch he owed. He had also been advised that he should increase his withholdings and \ndecrease his exemptions, but he did not do that. (Tr. 27) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR allegation 1.i is a home mortgage account that is alleged to be past due in \nthe amount of $10,951. Applicant has a repayment plan with the bank. He presented a \ndocument showing that his mortgage is $2,867 and is up to date as of February 2020. \n(AE C) This issue began in 2018, when he noted that he \u201cwas struggling with things.\u201d (Tr. \n41) He made a lump sum payment and the loan was modified to a lower interest rate. (Tr. \n43) \n \nSOR allegations 1.j and 1.k are two Federal student loan accounts that have been \nplaced for collection, for $64,762 and $16,933. . He obtained these loans when he \nattended undergraduate and graduate school in about 2007-2009. He stated that he fell \nbehind due to his wife\u2019s loss of employment on at least four occasions. (GE 1) In his \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he was using his 401(k) money to \nrepay the student loans at $900 a month. (GE 1) Applicant stated at the hearing that the \nlast payment he made was in June 2015. He stopped paying because the loans were no \nlonger deferred. However, he has been employed steadily since 2000 making a good \nsalary. Applicant explained that he had financial difficulties due to the tax issues. He also \nasserted that about $35,000 of the student loan debt was paid over the last two years, at \nabout $700 per pay period, through a wage garnishment. He provided no documentation \nto support this claim beyond AE E, a statement showing that only interests had been paid \non the loans. (AE E; Tr. 39-40)   \n \nSOR allegation 1.l is a judgment placed in 2017 in the amount of $7,733.30. \nApplicant purchased computer equipment in 2015. At first money for payments were \ntaken from his paycheck. He was vague about the details. He also noted that the creditor \nmight have sent him bills, but his address changed. He forgot about it, and then a lien \nwas placed. (Tr. 44) He believes the creditor garnished his pay and that the debt is almost \npaid. He believes that he bought about $10,000 or $12,000 in equipment from the creditor \nover the years. (Tr. 44) \n \nApplicant has credit cards and some personal loans. He bought his wife a new car \nin 2015. He also took a trip to the Caribbean in 2014. (Tr. 52) Applicant and his wife earn \nan approximate annual income of over $200,000, though her income varies.  He has had \nsteady income for the years since 2000, sometimes making as much as $239,000 \nannually. He knows that his wife was unemployed about four times, but she is now \nemployed and earns about $79,000 annually. He has a sizeable net remainder each \nmonth ($2,200). He did not submit a budget and made no mention of financial counseling. \nHe did not know the amount in either his checking account or his 401(k). (Tr. 51) \n \nApplicant submitted as post-hearing documentation a power of attorney for the tax \nrelief company signed in 2018. He also sent copies of his 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal \nincome tax returns signed March 2019. (AE D) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n\n \n4 \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant admitted that he had no good reason for not filing his Federal income tax \nreturns as required or paying the amounts due, and noted that he had used poor \njudgment. His debts did not occur due to conditions beyond his control but for his wife\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \noccasional unemployment. However, he owes a substantial amount of money in Federal \nincome tax and Federal student loan debt. He made no voluntary payments on his student \nloans, but rather his Navy retirement was garnished. He has been consistently employed \nearning a good salary and has a Navy retirement pension. He has had repayment plans \nin place for his Federal tax debt, but does not currently have a repayment plan in place \nwith the IRS. In addition, his federal student loans have been garnished. His most recent \n(2017) tax transcript shows a combined earned income of $300,000. For close to a \ndecade, he underpaid his federal tax debt despite being aware of his obligation each year. \nHe consistently under-withheld for many years. \n \nApplicant modified his mortgage and is now current on his payments. He only \nrecently engaged a tax attorney to address his past-due taxes. Beyond that, there is little \nevidence to show that Applicant has made a consistent or concerted effort to resolve any \nof his financial issues. He does not have a track record of financial responsibility. His \nwages are being garnished by two federal agencies.  He has shown a disregard for the \nlegal requirement to file his income tax returns and to pay the income taxes due. The tax \nissues led to other delinquencies and Applicant could provide no good reason as to why \nhe did not act earlier to resolve the situation.  \n \n Applicant has not acted responsibly and was not proactive about his financial issues until \nabout 2016, six years after he first learned of the tax issues. Without documentary \nevidence reflecting more effort, he has not demonstrated a track record of attempts to \naddress his financial problems and there is no indication that his financial situation is \nunder control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(d) and 20(g) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts remain unresolved, although through garnishments the amount of taxes and other \ndelinquencies have been lessened. He is now trying to work with a tax attorney to enter \ninto yet another IRS repayment plan. He stated that he just made a mistake, but has tried \nto mitigate the issues and should not lose his security clearance. He has not met his \nburden of proof in this case. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. against  \napplicant.  \n \n        Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s career in the U.S. Navy and his 20-year career in \nthe defense industry, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his financial indebtedness. I conclude that it is not in the national interest to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \n         Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 31, 2016. On July \n19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 9, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 19, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on October 15, 2019. On October 25, 2019, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for November 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection.

(Tr. 47.) In April 2009, he was not prepared to file his federal income tax \nreturn for 2008, and he obtained an extension until October 15, 2009. On October 15, \n2009, he had continued to procrastinate. He called the IRS, told the IRS representative \nthat he believed he was entitled to a refund for 2008, and asked about the \nrepercussions of not filing by October 15, 2009. Applicant testified that the \nrepresentative told him that there would be no penalty if he was entitled to a refund, but \nthat his refund would be forfeited if he did not file his return within three years of the \noriginal due date. Up to this time, Applicant had always received refunds. The federal \n\n \n3 \n \nrefunds ranged for $1,723 to $4,038, and the state refunds ranged from $99 to $348. \n(Tr. 21-22.) \n \n \nAfter filing his 2008 return, Applicant adopted a three-year deadline for filing late \nfederal and state returns. (Tr. 23.) Each tax year, he requested a six-month extension \nfor his federal return and then filed in accordance with his self-imposed three-year \ndeadline. (Tr. 46.) He never requested an additional extension beyond the automatic \nsix-month extension. (Tr. 63.) He could not recall when he started requesting extensions \nfrom the state. (Tr. 64.) He did not consider the impact of late filings on his security \nclearance until he was interviewed by a security investigator in July 2018. (Tr. 44.) He \nadmitted at the hearing that his attitude toward his obligations to timely file tax returns \nwas \u201clackadaisical.\u201d (Tr. 16.) \n \n \nApplicant knew that his tax liability increased as his children became adults and \nhe could no longer take deductions for them. In an effort to ensure that he would not \nowe federal taxes, he prepaid $1,000 with each extension to file for 2014, 2015, and \n2016, and he prepaid $3,500 with his 2017 request for an extension of time to file. \nHowever, his prepayments were insufficient to avoid a federal tax liability for 2016 and \n2017. (GX 2 at 8-12, 25.) When he filed his state income tax return for 2013 in May \n2017, he sent a payment of $500 to offset any state taxes due for 2016, which resulted \nin a refund for 2016. (Tr. 26.) As of June 27, 2019, Applicant had filed his federal and \nstate tax returns and paid all federal and state income taxes due. (Answer to SOR at \n25-28.) \n \n \nExcept for Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nand timely pay the taxes due, he has no other history of financial irresponsibility. His \ncredit record reflects no derogatory information. (AX B.) He earns about $121,000 per \nyear. His wife is a retired educator, receives a pension, and works occasionally as a \nsubstitute teacher. (Tr. 31.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, who has worked with him for 14 years, submitted \na letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness and opining that he should \nbe allowed to retain his security clearance. (AX E.) Applicant\u2019s department security \nrepresentative, who has worked with him for 31 years, attested to his unquestionable \nethics, integrity, and attention to detail. He believes that Applicant\u2019s neglect of his \nobligation to timely file his tax returns was an anomaly and should not preclude him \nfrom holding a security clearance. (AX C.) A former peer who became Applicant\u2019s \ndepartment manager considers Applicant trustworthy, reliable, and worthy of retaining \nhis security clearance. (AX D.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n4 \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s neglect of his federal and state tax \nobligations was recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making \nrecurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has filed all his past-due tax returns and \npaid the taxes due. However, Applicant\u2019s eventual compliance with his tax obligations \ndoes not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement \n\n \n6 \n \nprocedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nThe fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). He did \nnot abandon his three-year rule until he was interviewed by a security investigator in \nJuly 2018 and realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. His belated action in \nan effort to protect his security clearance \u201cdoes not reflect the voluntary compliance of \nrules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor and \nheld a security clearance for many years. He was candid and remorseful at the hearing. \nOn the other hand, he admitted that his failure to timely file his returns was due to \nprocrastination and a lackadaisical attitude about his tax obligations. He may be a \nconscientious employee and a careful manager of his personal finances, but he has \noffered no excuse other than procrastination for failing to carry out his basic duty as a \ncitizen to timely file his tax returns. He is an intelligent, well-educated adult, but his \nexplanation for his failures to timely file his returns conflates the rule for forfeiture of \nrefunds with the legal requirement to file timely returns.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has established the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 20(g), the \nestablishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable security-\nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014). \u201cOnce a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n\n \n7 \n \n09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). Applicant has not overcome this \npresumption. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline \nF, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his intentional and repeated \nfailures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and pay the taxes due. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 41-year-old deployable armed guard, employed by a government contractor since May 2017. He was unemployed from November 2016 to May 2017 after his discharge from the U.S. Army. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 and a master\u2019s degree in 2019. He served in the Army National Guard from 2001 to 2002, and was on active duty in the National Guard and the regular Army from 2004 until 2016. He deployed twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, six Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two campaign stars. He was honorably discharged in November 2016. He married in 1997 and has three children. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on ten debts totaling over $38,000. These consumer debts were charged off or in a collection status. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations with each. He noted that it was challenging to find work after leaving active duty and once he found work with his current employer, he began to settle or pay his delinquent debts. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a mortgage account delinquency from 2016. Applicant contacted the lender in 2017, and negotiated a reduced interest rate.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel  \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/03/2020 \nDecision \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 24, 2017. On \nJune 7, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 30, 2019 (Ans.), and requested a decision \nbased on the written record without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with \nsupporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was submitted by \nDepartment Counsel on July 26, 2019. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \n\n \n2 \n \nrebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM and submitted a \nreply, dated November 2, 2019. The case was assigned to me on November 13, 2019. \nApplicant did not object to any matters contained in the record. Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 5 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old deployable armed guard, employed by a government \ncontractor since May 2017. He was unemployed from November 2016 to May 2017 after \nhis discharge from the U.S. Army. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2019. He served in the Army National Guard from 2001 to 2002, and was on \nactive duty in the National Guard and the regular Army from 2004 until 2016. He deployed \ntwice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, six Army \nCommendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, and the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal with two campaign stars. He was honorably discharged in November 2016. He \nmarried in 1997 and has three children. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on ten debts \ntotaling over $38,000. These consumer debts were charged off or in a collection status. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations with each. He noted \nthat it was challenging to find work after leaving active duty and once he found work with \nhis current employer, he began to settle or pay his delinquent debts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a mortgage account delinquency from 2016. Applicant contacted the \nlender in 2017, and negotiated a reduced interest rate. He has since brought the account \ncurrent since at least June 2019. This debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, c, d, h, and j are delinquent consumer debts, including two car loans \nand credit card accounts, that have been included in repayment plans. These debts \nbecame delinquent in 2017 and Applicant made contact with most of the creditors in 2018 \nto initiate repayment plans. Monthly installment payments have been consistently made \nper the plan requirements, and in the case of a car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant \nsubstantially increased the installment amount in July 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a car loan \nthat Applicant admitted, but disputed the amount owed. He has since agreed to a \nrepayment plan, and began payments in July 2019. These debts are in the process of \nbeing resolved. \n  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, f, and g are consumer and government debts that were paid in full in \n2019. These debts are resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.i is a credit card debt that has been canceled \nby the creditor, and a cancellation of debt form 1099-C was issued for tax year 2014, and \ncorrected in 2019. This debt is no longer a concern. \n  \nApplicant noted in his response to the FORM, that most of his debts were incurred \nduring his period of unemployment after leaving active duty. Since he began employment \nwith his current employer, he has lived a modest lifestyle while sending his two daughters \nto college, with his youngest daughter is in high school. Applicant has taken overseas \n\n \n3 \n \nassignments, and while overseas, he completed a master\u2019s degree and is working on a \nsecond master\u2019s degree. His spouse provided a letter of support, noting Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent employment and veteran\u2019s benefits result in the best financial condition they have \nhad in 24 years of marriage. She attests to Applicant\u2019s work ethic and trustworthiness, \nand she noted that they have worked together to devise a budget so that they can pay for \ncollege expenses and pay down debts. Applicant\u2019s current credit report shows no current \ncollection accounts. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \n\n \n4 \n \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n5 \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good- faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant incurred financial delinquencies while unemployed after leaving military \nservice. He began to address his debts once he was reemployed. Applicant made contact \nwith creditors, arranged payment plans for the largest debts and began payments, and \npaid in full debts totaling over $1,800. He also ensured that his mortgage was current and \nshowed evidence of its good standing. One debt amount was disputed, but it is now in an \nagreed payment plan. A final aged credit card debt has been canceled by the creditor, \nand a IRS Form 1099-C was issued. Although I do not have evidence of professional \nfinancial counseling, Applicant has worked with his spouse on a budget and his current \ncredit report shows no debts in collections. \n \nOverall, Applicant made significant efforts to resolve his debts once he was \nfinancially secure. His current credit report shows an ability to maintain a satisfactory \nfinancial status. I am convinced Applicant now makes good financial decisions, and his \n\n \n6 \n \nfinancial status no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from a period of unemployment, but \nsince being reemployed, he has acted responsibly to resolve debts and has not \naccumulated new delinquencies. I do not believe that further financial problems are likely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s distinguished military service and significant efforts to resolve debts once \nreemployed. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to show reasonable resolution of the \nSOR debts and overall financial responsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is granted. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

(Items 2, 6, 7) The debt-relief law firm provided him with \nfinancial counseling as well as a plan to place all of his debts in a debt negotiation \nprogram. (Item 2, 6, 7)  \n \nSince September 2017, Applicant has been paying the debt relief law firm $1,100 \na month by direct debit. His SOR Answer and post-FORM submission confirmed that he \nhas been making timely payments to the debt-relief law firm per their agreement. (Items \n2, 7) He noted in his SOR Answer that his largest debt of $27,479 was paid in full, \npresumably settled for a lesser amount.

Applicant stated that he hopes by his documented corrective action it \nwill be evident that he is doing the right thing and will be out of debt in the near future. \n(Item 7) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \n \n AG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(e) are not applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant recognized that his finances \nhad gotten out of control and entered into a contract with a debt-relief law firm on July \n29, 2017, which was before he completed his SF-86 on December 1, 2017, and long \nbefore his SOR was issued on May 23, 2019. Since September 2017, he has been \nmaking $1,100 monthly payments to the debt-relief law firm by direct debit. Although the \ncircumstances that gave rise to his financial difficulties are unclear, his subsequent \ncorrective action reflects a desire on Applicant\u2019s part to right the ship and regain \nfinancial responsibility. \n \nOf the nine debts alleged, the largest debt of $27,479 has been paid in full \nleaving a maximum balance of $54,572 owed on the remaining eights debts. I recognize \nthat this amount owed cannot be current given the $1,100 monthly payments Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nhas been making since September 2017. While this is not a small number, the \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Appeal Board \nhas established the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as this: \n \nan applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations 32(?) and \nquotations omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation, I view Applicant\u2019s corrective action to be reasonable. He has initiated a \npragmatic approach to the repayment of his eight remaining SOR debts and is \nmaking a good-faith effort to resolve those debts. If the estimate provided by the \ndebt-relief law firm of 48 months proves to be accurate, Applicant will be debt-\nfree in approximately September 2021. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant is a 56-year-old foreman inspector employed by \na defense contractor since July 1982. There is no evidence of any security violations \nduring those 37 plus years. He has spent his adult working life in furtherance of \nsupporting the Government\u2019s mission and those years of service warrant consideration. \nApplicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain financial \nresponsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt repayment.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Price, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jacob T. Ranish, Esq. \n11/16/2020 \nDecision \nWESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate personal conduct concerns, but mitigated financial \nconsideration concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a \nsensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 6, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the personal conduct and financial considerations guidelines the \nDoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 21, 2020, and requested a hearing. \nA hearing was initially scheduled for August 4, 2020, and was twice continued before \nbeing rescheduled for September 8, 2020. The case was heard on the rescheduled \ndate. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of nine exhibits (GE). Applicant \nrelied on seven exhibits and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nSeptember 18, 2020. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the proceedings be kept \nopen to permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with post-hearing \nendorsements. For good cause shown, applicant was granted 14 days to supplement \nthe record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. Within the time \npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a character reference.The \nsubmission was admitted without objection as AE H. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was terminated from his employment \nwith Company A in January 2012 for a verbal confrontation with a client during which he \nbrandished a knife; (b) was terminated from Company B in March 2013 for changing his \nleave itinerary without approval, and not being honest regarding his whereabouts; and \n(c) was terminated from his employment with Company C in November 2017 for job \nabandonment without notice and falsifying his timesheet. Allegedly, these allegations \nremain of continuing security concern. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2016, as required. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax return for tax year 2016 remains a security concern.   \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations pertaining \nto his three employment terminations between January 2012 and November 2017 with \nexplanations. He denied that the articulated reasons for his termination from each of the \nemployers covered in the SOR constitutes a complete and accurate reflection of the \nfacts. Addressing the allegations covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant admitted the \nallegation but denied that it constitutes a full or fair picture of mitigating circumstances. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old information technology (IT) lead for a defense \ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The SOR allegations that are admitted by \nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has married for the first time in March 2020.

(GE 1) \nSince March 2016 he has attended college classes on a part-time basis and needs two \nmore credits to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information technology and cyber \nsecurity. (Tr. 19-20) Applicant has never served in the military.  \nSince November 2017, Applicant has worked for his current employer as an IT \nlead. (GE 1) Between September 2011 and November 2017, he worked for various \nemployers in electronic technician positions. (GE 1) \nEmployment separation history \nIn January 2012, Applicant was terminated from his FSR lead position with \nCompany A after engaging in a verbal confrontation with a Marine client and \nbrandishing a knife in October 2011 (GE 1; Tr. 19-20) Before being sent home by his \nemployer at the time, he was observed by several Marines to be arguing with a Marine \nclient and speaking badly to him. (GE 8) After the Marine client pulled a gun on \nApplicant, Applicant brandished a knife at the customer in an effort to repel the \nperceived threat. (GE 2; Tr. 52-53) Responding to the Marine client\u2019s weapons threat, \nApplicant called his onsite company supervisor for help. (Tr. 47-48) \nMarine police investigators that were called to investigate the October 2011 \naltercation incident involving Applicant and the Marine client cited Applicant for assault \nwith a knife against an active duty Marine enlistee known to Applicant at the time of the \nreported assault. (GE 8) In his own report of the incident to investigating Marine \ninvestigators, Applicant claimed that his Marine client customer initiated the physical \nexchange with him and detailed how the Marine client entered his work space and \nphysically confronted him. (GE 8) Thereafter, Applicant and the Marine enlistee \nengaged in a brief but intense verbal altercation. \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s account in the JPAS incident report of the October 2011 \nincident, shortly after the Marine client confronted Applicant over his claimed \nentitlement to the computer Applicant was entrusted with, the Marine client/customer \npulled a magazine from a pouch in his pants, inserted it into the magazine well of his \nhand gun, and pointed the weapon at Applicant\u2019s head. (GE 8; Tr. 47) After briefly \nvacating the room occupied by the Marine client, Applicant returned to the doorway of \nthe room to retrieve his laptop. (Tr. 49-51) Upon Applicant\u2019s call for help to his onsite \ncompany supervisor, Marine investigators arrived at the scene and undertook their own \ninternal investigation. (GE 8; Tr. 24-26) At the outset of their investigation, they told \nApplicant to leave the room. (GE 8; Tr. 53-54) Before heeding the military investigators\u2019 \ninstruction to leave the room, Applicant continued to engage in a heated exchange with \nthe Marine client that included physical threats of bodily harm directed at each other. \n(GEs 4 and 8) \nApplicant attributed his aggressive reactions to the Marine client in the October \n2011 incident to the emotional stresses he experienced from his witnessing insurgent \nactivity in Afghanistan. (Tr. 23-24, 54-58) He acknowledged, though, that he could have \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nleft the scene earlier in his ongoing confrontation with the Marine client and reported the \nclient\u2019s actions to superior authorities. (Tr. 27) What is especially troubling about \nApplicant\u2019s account is his minimizing of the incident in his assignment of reasons for his \ntermination in the electronic questionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) he \ncompleted in December 2017. (GE 1) Asked the reasons for his stated firing from \nCompany A in 2012, he admitted only to \u201cfussing with client/customer.\u201d (GE 1) Whether \nminimizing to promote a more favorable profile of himself or failing to appreciate the \nseriousness of his actions that prompted his termination, Applicant\u2019s responses are \nconcerning and reflect lapses in candor and judgment. \nWhen asked for more information about the October 2011 altercation incident in \na follow-up OPM interview with an investigating agent in September 2018, Applicant \nreported only that he was sent home by his Company A supervisor \u201cdue to arguing with \nthe client\u201d over their respective mission roles and having the client pull a gun on him. \n(GE 2) He made no mention in the interview of his brandishing a knife in front of the \nMarine client. (GE 2) \nApplicant was terminated by a second employer (Company B) in March 2013 for \ncited misconduct. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 55-56) Prior to being terminated, Applicant\u2019s employer \ncited Applicant in January 2013 for changing his itinerary without approval and failing to \nbe honest about his whereabouts in January 2013. (GE 7; Tr.28-33) In a termination \nmemorandum of March 5, 2013, his supervisor with Company B characterized \nApplicant\u2019s actions as a direct violation of the company\u2019s crew health and safety policy \nand actions, enough to warrant termination of his services upon his repatriation to his \nhome of record in the United States. (GE 7) Applicant attributed his absence from his \nassigned duty station to a misunderstanding over who he was required to notify of his \npending departure from his duty station. (Tr. 31-32, 58-60) Asked about the reasons for \nhis termination in his 2017 e-QIP, he could not remember why he was fired. (GE 1) \nRecords confirm that in November 2017 Applicant was terminated by another \nemployer (Company C). (GEs 1-3) This time, he was charged by his Company C \nemployer with abandoning his assigned job location in Afghanistan on November 5, \n2017 without proper advance notice to his employer. (GEs 3-6; Tr. 33-40) \nApplicant claimed that he left his post on November 5, 2017, to see his critically \nill father state side and informed his onsite supervisor back in August 2017 of his \nintentions before making his unilateral decision in November 2017 to depart for home. \n(GE 2-4; Tr. 33) He claimed, too, that he informed his Company C human resources \n(HR) manager of his intentions before departing and was told only to let his onsite \nsupervisor know. (Tr. 34)  \nOnce Applicant reached his state side destination, Applicant claimed he called \nhis onsite supervisor in Afghanistan and told him \u201che could not do my time sheet\u201d \nbecause of restrictions in his employees handbook that precluded him from charging \nearned leave time while in Afghanistan. (GE 6; Tr. 34) He claimed to have further \nadvised his onsite supervisor in Afghanistan that he needed to talk to his HR manager \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nbecause \u201che was not going to come back\u201d to his Company C employer and would be \ntaking a new job state side, effective November 20, 2017. (GEs 3-6; Tr. 35, 63-65)  \nApplicant\u2019s Company C employer considered his attempt to resign, effective \nNovember 18, 2017, to be ineffective. His Company C employer found that Applicant \nfalsified his time sheet for the period of November 5-17, 2017, and effectively resigned \nhis position on November 5, 2017. (GEs 3-6; Tr. 63-65) Company C\u2019s findings are \ncorroborated in the DoD\u2019s JPAS report. Applicant\u2019s Company C employer cited \nevidentiary support from Applicant\u2019s onsite supervisor that Applicant had abandoned his \nposition in Afghanistan on November 5, 2017, and not November 17, 2017, as Applicant \nclaimed in his emailed resignation. (GEs 5-6) \nWhile Applicant may have told his onsite supervisor in August 2017 that he might \nbe leaving his work site due to his father\u2019s illness, he never purchased his airline tickets \nfor his trip to the United States until the date of his departure, November 5, 2017. (GEs \n4 and 6; Tr. 65-66, 68-70, and 78-79) Despite his departure for home on November 5, \n2017, he continued to submit inventory reports and timesheets through November 17, \n2017, claiming that he was working at his work site. (GEs 3-6) \nIn an email of November 18, 2017 to his onsite supervisor, Applicant confirmed \nhis leaving his work site \u201cto head home due to his father\u2019s passing.\u201d (GE 6) In this same \nemail, he told his onsite supervisor he was making arrangements for getting his mother \nsituated and starting a new job state side on November 20, 2017. (GE 6) \nWhen Applicant spoke to his HR manager on November 20, 2017, he told her \nthat if he had \u201cput the 5th  for my last day I wouldn\u2019t got my PTO (personal time off) in 30 \ndays in advance.\u201d (GE 6) Denying any falsification of his time sheet, he defended his \ncharging time worked for the November 5-17 timeframe, claiming these hours \nrepresented earned and entitled PTO hours. (GEs 4-6) Email records document that \nneither Applicant\u2019s onsite supervisor nor his HR manager accepted Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations and found him to have abandoned his worksite without proper notices and \napprovals. (GEs 4-6) \nEmail exchanges between Applicant and his Company C employer fully support \nhis employer\u2019s version of the timing of Applicant\u2019s abandonment of his work site on \nNovember 5, 2017 without proper notices or approvals (leaving behind keys in an \nunlocked vehicle and an office room in disarray). (GE 6) Once he was state side, he \nemailed his resignation, bearing a date of November 18, 2017. (GE 6) \nApplicant\u2019s claimed misunderstandings as to who he needed to notify before \ndeparting for the United States to see his ill father are not corroborated by any of the \ninformation included in Applicant\u2019s December 2017 e-QIP, in his September 2019 \ninterview with an OPM investigator, in Company C\u2019s November 2017 termination letter, \nor by any furnished documentary evidence. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on a consideration of all of the compiled evidence in the record, Company \nC\u2019s findings provide the most accurate account of Applicant\u2019s actions while employed by \nCompany C. Company C\u2019s overall findings are well supported and are accepted. \nLooking back in hindsight Applicant believes he should have contacted his HR \noffice and asked for leave paperwork, and he expressed his regrets for not doing so. \n(Tr. 42) Because he never went through the proper channels to obtain leave, Applicant\u2019s \nCompany C employer never accepted his November 18, 2017, emailed resignation and \ntreated his exit from his work site on November 5, 2017 as a site abandonment. (GEs 3-\n6; Tr. 71-72)   \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year of \n2016. (GE 9) An IRS account transcript confirmed that Applicant filed his 2016 federal \ntax return in July 2019 and received a tax refund of $5,600 in September 2019 with \nadded interest of $48.49. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 23-34) \nApplicant attributed his late filing with help of his wife to his military deployment \nand reliance on his retained tax accountant to prepare and submit his 2016 return. (GE \n2; Tr. 22-23) He later learned that his accountant became ill and was unavailable to \nApplicant to communicate with about the status of his 2016 tax return. (GE 2; Tr. 22-23) \nBoth in his OPM interview and in his hearing testimony, Applicant affirmed that \nhis retained tax accountant never obtained a federal filing extension for Applicant and \nnever filed a 2016 federal tax return on Applicant\u2019s behalf. (Tr. 22-23) Applicant assured \nthat he first learned that his 2016 federal tax return was never filed before he completed \nhis security clearance application. Applicant\u2019s explanations for not filing his 2016 federal \ntax return in a timely way are both plausible and credible, and are accepted. (GE 9; Tr. \n23) \nCharacter references \nApplicant is well-regarded by his current supervisors, colleagues (both present \nand past), friends, and former clients of his who have worked closely with him and find \nhim reliable and trustworthy. (AEs C and H-I) Applicant has received excellent \nperformance evaluations from his current employer recognizing his contributions as a \nnetwork engineer. (AEs E and H; Tr. 17) Applicant is active in his community as a \nneighborhood trainer and works with Little League organizers in providing training \nassistance. (Tr. 43) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance \nshould be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges \nto place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in \nthe guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 15. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; \nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s forced separations from the three \nemployers he worked for between 2011 and 2017. Additional security concerns are \nraised over Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s three involuntary separations for cause over a six-year span (2012-\n2017) reflect material violations of prescribed Base rules, established protocol, and bas-\napproved practices for ensuring good order in the case of his October 2011 altercation \nincident with a Marine client. This incident represented neither a minor breach of Base \nrules, protocol, and Base-approved practices nor an isolated incident in an otherwise \nsolid employment history. Leave issues raised with Applicant\u2019s Company B and \nCompany C employers in 2013 and 2017, respectively, are both compounding and \nreflective of a pattern of Applicant departures from established employer rules and \nnorms of trust.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns \nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability \nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s three separations for cause between 2012 and 2017. So much trust is \nimposed on those cleared to access classified and sensitive information that \naccommodations for breaches are necessarily narrowly calibrated. See Snepp v. United \nStates, 444 U.S. 506, 511 n.6 (1980). \nTogether, these three covered incidents in the SOR warrant the application of DC \n\u00b6 16(d)(2)(3). DC \u00b6 16(d)(2)(3) provides as follows: \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  .  .  .  . \nApplicant\u2019s actions when considered together with all of the developed facts and \ncircumstances in this administrative record support the application of \u00b6 16(d)(2) and (3). \nTo be sure, Applicant has made considerable progress with his current employer. \nUniformly, his current supervisors, colleagues, friends, and former clients of his credit \nhim with honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness. His credits with his current employer \ninclude excellent performance evaluations recognizing his contributions as a network \nengineer. Further, he has been active in his community as a neighborhood trainer and \nworks with Little League organizers in providing training. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s credits and contributions augur well for Applicant\u2019s professional \ndevelopment. Still, Applicant\u2019s involuntary terminations entail serious breaches of rules, \nregulations, and protocols of good practice and honesty that are incompatible with \nminimum criteria for holding a security clearance. \nAt this time, it is simply too soon to make safe predictive judgments about \nApplicant\u2019s ability to safeguard classified and sensitive information. Potentially \napplicable mitigating conditions are not available to Applicant at this time. \nFinancial concerns \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal \nincome tax return for the tax year of 2016. Applicant\u2019s filing failure warrants the \napplication of one disqualifying condition of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6 \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns, or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted failure to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return (filed \nlate in 2019) negates the need for any independent proof. See Directive 5220-6 at E3. \n1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). His admitted tax filing lapse is \nfully documented and create some initial judgment issues. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n01059 at 3 App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a \nsecurity clearance that entitles the person to access classified information. While the \nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is \nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases \ninvolving debt delinquencies and tax-return filing lapses. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing failures and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to a fair assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those \nseeking access to classified or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR case No. 14-\n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2016 federal tax return, while serious, is \nisolated and accompanied by a good faith misunderstanding that his tax return was \nbeing prepared and filed by his engaged tax preparer while he was overseas. Two \nmitigating conditions are available to him. DC \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does no cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d and 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances,\u201d both apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nConsidering all of the facts and circumstances in the record, Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file his 2016 federal tax return is mitigated. Mitigation conclusions are based on \nthe unintentional and isolated basis of Applicant\u2019s late filing of his 2016 federal tax \nreturn in 2019 with the help of his wife after he learned of the filing failure by his \nengaged tax preparer. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his past breaches of rules, regulations, and guidelines while \nemployed by previous employers and his failure to timely file his 2016 federal tax return \nThese issues are relevant to making an assessment of whether Applicant\u2019s covered \nactions are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nWhile Applicant is entitled to considerable credit for the progress he has made \nwith his current employer in all phases of his assignments, his efforts are not enough at \nthis time to overcome the number of serious adverse actions attributable to him while \nemployed by previous employers. Only his satisfactory addressing of his 2016 federal \ntax filing lapse is sufficiently mitigated to enable Applicant to meet the minimum \neligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial concerns are \nmitigated. However, personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reason (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 24, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December \n18, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Applicant was \n\n \n2 \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. She did not provide a response, \nsubmit documents, or object to any of the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 1 through 4 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She denied the SOR \nallegation in \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. She married in 1993. She has four children, ages 30, \n27, 24, and 20. She has been employed since March 2014. Before then she was \nunemployed for three months. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant completed a questionnaire for national security positions (SF 86) in \nDecember 2017. Section 23 asked whether in the last seven years Applicant illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances. She responded, \u201cNo.\u201d (Item 3) \n \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She \ntold the investigator that personal recreational use of marijuana is legal where she \nresides, and she did not feel her use was illegal. She has not used any other illegal \ndrugs. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed a second time by a government investigator in March \n2019. During this interview, she stated that from March 2005 to September 2005, she \nsmoked marijuana one to two times a month with a friend, who supplied the drug. She \nhas not had contact with this friend for many years. Applicant told the investigator that \nshe had not used marijuana from September 2005 to January 2014. She did not use \ndrugs during this period because the job she held had random drug testing. When she \nbecame unemployed in January 2014, she used marijuana once or twice with her \nhairdresser. She then disclosed she used marijuana in an edible form in August 2018 \nand again in December 2018. She purchased the edible marijuana in a location where it \nis not illegal under the laws of that jurisdiction. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant was asked during her March 2019 interview why she did not disclose \nher past drug use on her SF 86. She told the investigator that she did not believe she \nhad to report her 2005 use. She also said she thought her more recent marijuana use \nwas legal, and she did not believe she was required to disclose it. She was then \ninformed by the investigator that marijuana use is illegal under Federal law. Applicant \nindicated to the investigator that she did not know that when she completed her SF 86. \nHer 2018 marijuana uses were after she completed the SF 86. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that she did not use marijuana while employed \nwhere drug testing was conducted because she did not want any problems or violations \nassociated with its use. She used it to relax and for stress. She stated she no longer \n\n \n3 \nuses marijuana. She has found other outlets for stress relief. She does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future. She no longer associates with those in her past that she used \nmarijuana with. She has never had a positive drug screening from her past \nemployments. (Item 4) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, states that the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant completed her SF 86 for a public trust position in December 2017. She \nwas only required to report drug use in the last seven years. Her 2005 use was not \nrequired to be disclosed. I found Applicant\u2019s statements credible that she did not believe \nher more recent uses were illegal. Her 2018 marijuana use occurred after she \ncompleted her SF 86 and therefore could not be reported on the SF 86. Applicant was \nunaware that marijuana use is illegal under federal law and did not become aware of it \nuntil she was advised by the government investigator. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her past drug use. I find that she has \nrefuted the personal conduct allegation. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n\n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse. \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in 2005, 2014, and in August and December 2018.  \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was sporadic. Her 2014 use coincided with her \nunemployment and was infrequent. She abstained from marijuana use when she was \nemployed and subject to random drug testing. Her more recent marijuana uses were in \nAugust 2018 and December 2018, subsequent to the completion of her SF 86. As noted \nabove, Applicant was unaware that marijuana use is a violation of federal law until she \nwas told by a government investigator during her December 2018 background interview. \nHer more recent uses took place in a jurisdiction where recreational use is legal. She \nstated she does not intend to use marijuana in the future. She has found other outlets to \nreduce her stress. I believe now that she is aware of the legal ramifications under \nfederal law, that future use is unlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence that the \nabove mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \n\n \n6 \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant has met her burden of persuasion. There is sufficient evidence to \novercome the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nApplicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He is a high school graduate and earned a technical degree in 2006. He never married. He has a 17-year-old child from a previous relationship. He presently works as a software engineer. He estimated his current salary to be around $78,000. He does not have any savings. He is current on his monthly expenses. (Tr. 16-18, 29-31) The SOR alleges Applicant has two delinquent debts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a collection account for an apartment lease. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had a dispute with the landlord about the plumbing in his apartment. He was not going to pay the amount owed due to the dispute, but then decided to resolve it, concluding his job was a higher priority. He stated he did not think this should have an impact on his security clearance eligibility. He provided proof that he paid this debt. It is resolved. (Tr. 18-22; AE B, D) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to State A in the approximate amount of $71,053 for child support arrearages. Applicant admitted the allegation in his answer to the SOR, but stated that for the first five years of his child\u2019s life he lived with his son and his son\u2019s mother and provided financial support.

There \nwere no objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits, and they were admitted into evidence. \nThe record was held open until January 29, 2020, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments, which he did. They were marked as Appellant Exhibits (AE) AE A though D \nand admitted into evidence without objection. (Hearing Exhibit I) DOHA received the \nhearing transcript on January 24, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is a high school graduate and earned a technical \ndegree in 2006. He never married. He has a 17-year-old child from a previous \nrelationship. He presently works as a software engineer. He estimated his current salary \nto be around $78,000. He does not have any savings. He is current on his monthly \nexpenses. (Tr. 16-18, 29-31) \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has two delinquent debts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a \ncollection account for an apartment lease. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that \nhe had a dispute with the landlord about the plumbing in his apartment. He was not going \nto pay the amount owed due to the dispute, but then decided to resolve it, concluding his \njob was a higher priority. He stated he did not think this should have an impact on his \nsecurity clearance eligibility. He provided proof that he paid this debt. It is resolved. (Tr. \n18-22; AE B, D) \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to State A in the \napproximate amount of $71,053 for child support arrearages. Applicant admitted the \nallegation in his answer to the SOR, but stated that for the first five years of his child\u2019s life \nhe lived with his son and his son\u2019s mother and provided financial support. (Record) \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2018. He was \nconfronted by the investigator about his child support arrearages. Applicant said he was \naware of the debt, but did not agree with the past-due amount because he was currently \npaying his child support obligation that is automatically deducted from his pay. (GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his son was born in State A and Applicant lived with his son \nand mother for about four years. Applicant then moved to another state for a year before \nreturning to State A. When he returned, he did not live with his son and the mother. He \ndid not go to court to determine his child support obligation, but said the mother may have \ngone to court, but he does not know. He testified that he has been aware that he was \ndelinquent in his child support payments from the time the delinquency began accruing. \nHe estimated he has been in arrears for at least 10 years. He believes he learned of the \narrearages from a letter he received from State A or when he viewed State A\u2019s website \nabout his child support obligation. (Tr. 22, 33) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant presently has his current child support payments withdrawn directly from \nhis paycheck. He said he was current with his bi-monthly payments. He assumed that \nState A would garnish additional amounts from his paycheck to pay his arrearages or \nwithhold any tax refund he may be due to pay the arrearages. He expected that through \nthese means, the amount would eventually be paid. He has not contacted State A to make \narrangements to pay the arrearages. He explained the only time he did not pay his child \nsupport was when he did not have a job or had no money. He could not provide more \nspecifically what period of time that he was unable to pay. (Tr. 22, 26, 37-38 \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he pays his current child support \npayments and sends extra money and gifts to his son. He further stated: \u201cI am not worried \nabout this debt and do not believe owing child support should be an issue or taken into \nconsideration.\u201d (Record) \n \nApplicant testified: \u201cBut I still send the child money and buy [him] gifts and stuff like \nthat. So I don\u2019t really like, I\u2019ll pay off the debt. I don\u2019t think it is a big deal.\u201d (Tr. 25) He said \nthat he provides for his son when his son needs it. When asked how much he pays in \nmonthly child support, he said he did not know and that he does not look at his paycheck. \nHe thought he paid about $500 a month. In post-hearing documents, he provided a copy \nof his pay stub that shows he pays $257 per pay period, which is twice a month. He said \n\u201cThey just take the money out of my paycheck and I\u2019m just going to pay it until it\u2019s paid \noff.\u201d (Tr. 24) He reiterated that he was not worried about it. As far as any payments made \ntoward the balance in arrears, he stated that his tax refunds are withheld, but no other \npayments are made. He confirmed that he has not contacted State A to increase his \npayments to address the arrearage. (Tr. 23-29; AE C) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was asked what his intent was regarding his child support \narrearages, he stated his number one priority was to give his son money directly and \nprovide for him (Tr. 38-40) He stated: \n \nI think I will try and increase it or see exactly what I can do. But I will have \nto check that out and see what I can do. I could, you know, I guess I will call \nthem and try to see if I could make a plan or get online and see if I could \nmake a plan with them. Like, the mom doesn\u2019t really care. So, I don\u2019t, so I \nhaven\u2019t really tried to do much. She\u2019s kind of happy just the way things are. \nSo, but I will make an effort to pay this off. (Tr. 40) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibit, he stated he would contact the state to try and \narrange a payment plan to resolve the debt. He intended to pay all of his debts in full, \nincluding his child support. He intended to help his child with whatever the child needs \nand help him with college or anything else. He said he intended to pay his child support \ndebt. (AE A) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent child support that began accumulating at least 10 years \nago that he has been unable and unwilling to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n6 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant was aware he had delinquent debts for some time. He resolved the \ndelinquent debt owed for his apartment. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to this debt. Applicant has not \nresolved his child support arrearages that he has been aware of since they began, at \nleast 10 years ago. He has not contacted the state to make arrangements to pay, although \nin his post-hearing documents he said he would. He said he did not pay his child support \nwhen he was unemployed or did not have enough money, but he was unable to provide \na specific time period. These factors were beyond his control, but there is no evidence he \nacted responsibly when he regained employment. Since being employed, he failed to \nprovide evidence as to why he did not pay or arrange a payment plan to satisfy the \narrearages. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. This debt has been ongoing and remains \nunresolved. His failure to understand the importance of resolving his obligation over the \nyears and refusal to take any substantive action on it continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He owes more than $70,000 in arrearages to State A for \ndelinquent child support. He has been aware of his obligation since the obligation became \ndelinquent years ago. He does not seem to appreciate the gravity of his obligation and \ndelinquency and has made no attempt to pay it or reduce it. In his post-hearing statement, \nhe said that he intends to contact the state to make payment arrangements. Intentions to \npay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of responsible actions. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing for a \npublic trust position (eQIP) on November 19, 2018. On May 20, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF \nacted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 27, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On October 16, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 5. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on October 28, 2019, and timely \nsubmitted his response, to which the Government did not object. Items 1 and 2 are the \npleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s FORM \n\n \n2 \n \nresponse included documents that are admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through G. The case was assigned to me on December 13, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), his \neQIP (Item 3), and a summary of his background investigation interview (Item 4). Item 4 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise \nany objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, \nhe could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 4 could be \nconsidered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise any objections in his FORM \nresponse or otherwise. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 31, has been married since 2015. He has four minor children. He \nearned his high school diploma in 2007. He attended college from 2007 through 2010, \nwithout earning a degree. He has been employed by various defense contractors as a \nclerk for the same military medical center since February 2011. He underwent a \nbackground investigation in 2010 for a temporary position he had with a defense \ncontractor. He did not know the level of access, if any, granted to him in connection with \nthat investigation. The current status of his access was not otherwise specified in the \nrecord. \n \nApplicant admitted each of the four student-loan debts alleged in the SOR totaling \n$54,226, at least two of which are federal loans totaling $20,183. In his SOR answer, \nwithout providing any corroborating documents, he denied the $786 credit-card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e on the basis that he resolved it via a $500 settlement. However, in \nhis FORM response, he acknowledged that it remained delinquent and that he set up a \npayment plan to resolve it via $25 monthly payments beginning in November 2019. He \ndid not provide proof that he made any of those payments. Although he asserted, during \nhis January 2019 background investigation interview, that his financial situation was \n\u201cgreat\u201d and that he was willing and able to pay his debts, he has not resolved any of the \nSOR debts. (Items 2, 4; AE A) \n \nApplicant claimed that he fell behind in payments to his student-loan creditors \nbetween about 2013 and 2016 because he could not afford the $500 monthly payments. \nHe also asserted that status of the monthly payments he had been making for the credit-\ncard account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. was unknown after the creditor filed bankruptcy. On \nhis eQIP, he reported one period of unemployment that followed a relocation, from \nJanuary 2010 through March 2010. He has been steadily employed full time since April \n2010. He did not otherwise provide more specific details, such as his relevant income and \nexpense history, to explain not only why his debts occurred, but also why they have \npersisted. (Item 4 at 2)   \n\n \n3 \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant asserted that he made numerous attempts to \nresolve his student-loan debts over the past eleven years, but struggled with the monthly \npayments given the unspecified costs associated with providing for the needs of his family \nof six. He claimed to have been in negotiations with a company to consolidate those loans. \nHowever, he had not yet reached a resolution. He did not provide any documents to \ncorroborate these claims.  \n \nApplicant understands the concerns with persons who may use their sensitive \nposition for financial gain. However, he maintained that he is not a risk because he would \nnever do anything to jeopardize his relationship with his wife and four children. He \nprovided copies of numerous certificates of training he has received in connection with \nhis employment. (FORM response; AE B-G) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2) \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision. \n \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to establish his or her eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure \n3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \n\n \n4 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved, including \nfederal student loans, despite being steadily employed full time since April 2010. He failed \nto establish that his financial situation resulted from circumstances beyond his control or \nthat he acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts. He did not provide proof that \nhe made any of the alleged payments towards his debts. He is credited with negotiating \na payment plan to resolve the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. However, he did not \ndemonstrate that he initiated good-faith efforts to repay or otherwise resolve his student-\nloan debts. Thus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated trustworthiness concerns \nraised by his indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \na public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

On August 15, 2019, Applicant timely submitted a response to the \nallegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n  \nOn October 28, 2019, I was assigned the case. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 14, 2019, setting the \nhearing for December 10, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered 12 documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-12. Without objection, the Government moved to strike \u201cthe words breather and \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nbreathalyzer refusal from [SOR allegation 1.c]. . . . [to] read, in June 2014 you were \nconvicted of DUI and sentenced to 30 days in jail.\u201d It also moved to \u201csubstitute DUI, \nsecond offense, to the words reckless driving\u201d in the second sentence of allegation 1.d., \nwhich was also granted without objection. (Transcript at 10-12) Applicant offered \ntestimony and 24 documents, accepted without objection as Exs. A-X. Additional \nmaterials, marked as Exs. Y-Z, were accepted from Applicant on December 12, 2019.  \n \nA transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on December 26, 2019. Upon \nreceipt of the transcript, the record was closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, and \nrecord as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns raised.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old cybersecurity engineer who has been in his present \npositon for nearly two years. He is considered an excellent employee and has \nmaintained a security clearance without adverse incident since 2006. He appreciates \nthe responsibilities of one maintaining a security clearance. (Tr. 26) Applicant has \nearned a master\u2019s degree in information systems.  \n \nMarried, Applicant is the father of a toddler and is expecting a second child. He is \nthe main wage-earner with an income of about $120,000 a year. His wife, who also \nmaintains a security clearance, works at home as a business analyst generating \napproximately $100,000 a year in salary.  \n \nThe couple own their home, in which no alcohol is present. Applicant has been \nabstinent since March 2018, consuming his last alcoholic beverages at a party for his \nchild. (Tr. 22). This led to his most recent alcohol-related incident, discussed below. \nPrior to that, he had not had alcohol for over three years. (Tr. 25, 62) He has never \nbeen diagnosed as an alcoholic or alcohol-dependent. (Tr. 27) He has had extensive \ncounseling and does not believe he has a problem with, or need for, alcohol. (Tr. 27) \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related issues and legal issues date back to at least 2010. \nOne night in about September 2010, Applicant was spotted by a police officer swerving \nhis car. (Tr. 46)  At the time he was heading back to his hotel after attending an event \nwhere he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 43) He passed the field sobriety test and he had a \n.06 or a .07 result on a breathalyzer reading, under the legal threshold of .08 for \nintoxication. (Tr. 28-29; 41) However. Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI). Being handcuffed and driven to the station was \u201cdevastating \nand it shook [him].\u201d (Tr. 46-47) His lawyer appeared in court and the matter was \ndropped. He no longer has much faith in field sobriety tests or breathalyzers. (Tr. 29) \n \nIn January 2012, Applicant was arraigned for DUI (first offense). Applicant had \nbeen stopped for a broken headlight after drinking at an earlier social event. (Tr. 49) He \ndoes not remember how much time had passed between his imbibing and his being \npulled over, nor does he recall how much alcohol he had consumed. (Tr. 49-50) He \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ndoes not remember the result of a urine test and does not recall whether a breathalyzer \nwas administered at the time of arrest. (Tr. 30, 52) His attorney negotiated a plea \nagreement. (Tr. 53) In February 2012, a deferred sentencing agreement was filed and \nApplicant was enrolled in a diversion program. (Ex. 6) Ultimately, the charges were \ndismissed as part of the plea agreement after successful conclusion of the diversion \nprogram (nolle diversion) in February 2013. (Ex. 6; Tr. 53) \n \nIn about April 2014, Applicant had been out with friends and had a \u201ccouple\u201d of \nalcoholic beverages. (Tr. 57) On the way home, his vehicle was rear-ended by another \ncar. The other driver appeared to be injured and he called the police. After officers \narrived, he was asked to submit to a breathalyzer and a field sobriety test, both of which \nhe refused because he \u201cwasn\u2019t confident to perform the test . . . .[he] did not think [he] \nwas under the influence.\u201d (Tr. 31) He did so because in the past, he had been told to \nrefuse such tests unless a lawyer was present. (Tr. 34) He was arrested and \nhandcuffed, leaving him to feel \u201cawful, not good.\u201d (Tr. 59)  \n \nIn June 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI. He admitted to the DUI charge \nand was convicted of that crime. (Tr. 56) He entered a diversion program, which he \nsuccessfully completed. A counselor gave him a good prognosis. (Tr. 59) He was \nadvised not to drink and drive in the future. After three alcohol-related incidents, \nApplicant began to feel he was \u201crunning out of luck\u201d and, given his job, marriage, and \nbaby, he realized he had too much to lose if his pattern continued. (Tr. 63) He \nunderstood \u201cbad things happen when I consume alcohol.\u201d (Tr. 63) At some point after \nthe 2014 incident, he decided to permanently quit using alcohol. (Tr. 61) He maintained \nthat commitment for \u201cover three years.\u201d (Tr. 62) \n \nDespite his decision to give up alcohol, Applicant again imbibed in March 2018. \nAfter drinking alcohol at a party for his child at home, Applicant and some friends went \nto a bar. (Tr. 65) While driving himself home around 3:30 a.m., he was detained at a \ntraffic stop by police. (Ex. 12; see also Tr. 70, indicating the stop was at about 1:00 \na.m.) His attorney argued that reckless driving was a more appropriate charge. (Tr. 34, \n71; Ex. 12). Applicant attended several alcohol counseling sessions and courses. He \nwas ultimately convicted of reckless driving and breathalyzer refusal, and his driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for three years.  It remains suspended. \n \nAs a consequence of the 2018 incident, Applicant was asked to resign from his \nemployer for violation of a new drug and alcohol policy. (Tr. 55) Applicant and \nmanagement discussed the issue. Applicant knew that even the reckless driving \nconviction could lead to his termination. (Tr. 76) It was ultimately agreed that Applicant \ncould simply resign from his position and keep his record \u201cclean.\u201d (Tr. 40) \n \nToday, Applicant maintains that he has never driven a vehicle under the \ninfluence of alcohol nor ever blown an alcohol level above the legal limit for intoxication \nand DUI. (Tr. 30) He has signed a letter of intent not to return to drinking. (Tr. 35-36, 38; \nEx. E) He believes he is no longer at risk for driving after drinking because he does not \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ndrink. (Tr. 36) After being assessed by a counselor, he was not found to be in need of \ntreatment. (Ex. F) It was noted that he was on a \u201cpositive trajectory.\u201d (Tr. 38) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four arrests within eight years each occurred after he imbibed alcohol.  \nAlthough the matter was dropped for the earliest incident when he was in his 20s, the \nremainder were arranged for alternative disposition so he was not subject to a DUI \nconviction. He was, however, found guilty of refusing to submit to a breathalyzer. These \nfacts potentially give rise to the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nHere, Applicant\u2019s multiple charges have been through the court system. He is \ncommitted to abstinence and, by extension, never driving after drinking again. He has \nbeen abstinent for at least two years. Until his termination, he was considered an \nexcellent employee. The incident in 2018 resulted in conviction and the suspension of \nhis driver\u2019s license. That suspension is still pending. The security concerns raised under \nthis guideline have been mitigated, in part, by the following factor: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nApplicant has been stopped while driving after imbibing alcohol and cited for \nalcohol-related charges on four occasions between 2010 and 2018. In the end, his \nattorney arranged for a dismissal of the 2010 charges; Applicant was alternatively \noffered entrance into a diversion program 2012; another diversion program was \ncompleted in response to the 2014 charges; and charges raised in 2018 for DUI were \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nlowered in favor of charges for reckless driving while he was found guilty of refusing to \ntake a breathalyzer. These incidents of concern are sufficient to raise disqualifying \ncondition: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder. \n \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license remains under suspension for the 2018 incident. His \nmost recent attempt at sobriety began that same year, after a previous attempt at \nsobriety that lasted about three years. Consequently, it is premature to conclude he has \nestablished a clear and established pattern of abstinence or is unlikely to again lapse in \nhis alcohol use despite his commitment to remain abstinent. At best, the facts presented \nraise the following mitigating condition in part:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable to the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nfour traffic stops and legal violations involving alcohol in the past decade, as well his \nloss of employment as a result of his 2018 incident: \n  \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2006. It must be assumed he \nunderstood the gravity of being invested with this credential. In 2010, 2012, 2014, and \n2018, he drove after consuming alcohol, was stopped by police officers, and was \ncharged with, at least, DUI on each occasion. After each occasion, he was aware that \nhis actions were dubious, at best. He found them \u201cdevastating,\u201d they \u201cshook him,\u201d and \nmade him feel \u201cawful,\u201d yet he continued with this practice. After the 2014 arrest, he felt \nhe was \u201crunning out of luck.\u201d He declared himself committed to sobriety that year. His \nluck did run out in 2018, when he was arrested and his pattern resumed. In March 2018, \nhe again decided to commit himself to sobriety, but his conduct still led to his departure \nfrom his employer. He took appropriate counseling and training, and is now waiting for \nhis period of driver\u2019s license suspension to be completed. He is clearly remorseful about \nhis past poor judgment and signed a letter of intent to remain sober.   \n \nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s last drink was in 2018. The Directive does not define \n\u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006). The Judge is required to \nevaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the \nrecency of an applicant's conduct. ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, \n2006).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s latest use of alcohol occurred about two years ago. His prior \ncommitment to sobriety lasted three to four years before relapse. Meanwhile, his \ndriver\u2019s license remains suspended. After considering the record as a whole, \nspecifically, the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s past incidents of driving after \ndrinking and his 2018 lapse in sobriety, I cannot conclude Applicant\u2019s track record for \ndrinking, then driving, and for failing to adhere to his commitment to sobriety \ndemonstrate that another incident is unlikely to recur. More time is also needed to \ndemonstrate his ability to control the temptations that lead have lead him to imbibe, then \ndrive, and rebuild a track record for sound judgment and reliability. Consequently, I find \nthat none of the available mitigating conditions (AG \u00b6 17(a)-(g)) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the three \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, background, age, and maturation. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance vis-\u00e0-vis his ability to \ncomport his personal conduct. In choosing to commit himself to sobriety as a safeguard \nagainst future driving after drinking, or even the appearance of poor judgment that \ncombination of activities represents, he now holds himself to a high standard. This is \ncommendable. However, his last commitment to sobriety lasted only about three or four \nyears before he lapsed. To date, his present commitment has only lasted about two \nyears, and his driver\u2019s license remains suspended. As a result of his behavior, he lost \nhis job. It is not unreasonable for Applicant\u2019s current demonstration of sobriety, sound \njudgment, and comportment with the law to last at least as long as his last period of \nsobriety or the duration of his license suspension.  I thus believe more time is needed to \ndemonstrate his present reliability and good judgment. Consequently, I conclude \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n         Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "full_text": "1 \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n--- \n) \nISCR Case No. 19-01503 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Allison Marie, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/15/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 24, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn an unspecified date, with merely brief comments, Applicant responded to the \nSOR. Because he had failed to \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d the allegations, he was advised to \nrespond more specifically. In a sworn statement dated August 17, 2019, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR, and he elected to have his case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. (Item 4)  A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \non November 1, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to \nthe FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on November 22, 2019. \nHis response was due on December 22, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the \nFORM, for as of January 13, 2020, no response had been received. The case was \nassigned to me on January 13, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his two responses to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.). \nApplicant\u2019s comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of \nthe evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a field and service mechanic with his current employer since March 2018. He served \nas an aircraft mechanic for another company from April 2017 until March 2018. He \npreviously served in an enlisted status with the U.S. Air Force on active duty from May \n2008 until May 2014, when he was honorably discharged. Other than some commentary \nregarding student loans, he reported no specific information regarding his education. He \nwas apparently granted a secret clearance, but while he does not recall the date, \nDepartment Counsel reports the date was 2008. He was married in 2008, and he was \ndivorced in 2017. He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 7 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated May 31, 2018); Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April \n15, 2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 1, 2018); and Item 4 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated August 17, 2019).  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed on three occasions: from March 2008 \nuntil he entered the U.S. Air Force in May 2008; from May 2014, upon his discharge, until \nNovember 2014; and from November 2016, upon returning to the United States from \nemployment overseas, until April 2017. (Item 5 \u2013 SF 86, dated April 9, 2018, at 16-18) He \nattributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: his estimated combined total of \none year of unemployment; his separation and divorce; and his ex-wife\u2019s financial issues \nthat he felt obligated to try to help her with while forgoing his own financial issues. (Item \n5, at 45) He failed to specify the negative impact his separation and divorce had on his \nfinances, or what the specific issues were regarding her finances, and what bills he paid \nfor her.  \nIn April 2018, Applicant contended that he had been in the process of rebuilding \nhis credit for the past year, and that he had already paid down credit cards and \u201ctaken \ncare of things in collections.\u201d (Item 5, at 45) He claimed that almost all of his disposable \nincome is used to pay down his debts whenever he can do so. He also stated that he had \ncontacted the company with his previous student loans, and that he was paying that \ncompany $100 per month, with the intention of increasing his payments once he obtains \na new position. (Item 5, at 45)  Applicant failed to submit any documents to support his \ncontentions that he contacted any creditors; that the U.S. Department of Education had \nplaced his student loans in deferment or forbearance; or that he had been making \npayments to any creditors. \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$71,955, as set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a student loan with an unpaid balance of \n$23,026 that was charged off and transferred to the government, and because it was \ncharged off, Applicant contends that he is no longer responsible for it. (Item 7, at 11; Item \n8, at 1; Item 6, at 7; Item 4, at 1); SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.e. are student loans with unpaid \nbalances of $3,913; $3,721; $3,435; and $1,868 that were in default and assigned to the \ngovernment, but Applicant claims they were consolidated and are being paid while he is \nin school. (Item 8, at 2; Item 6, at 5-8; Item 4, at 1-2); SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a student loan with an \nunpaid balance of $35,992 for which Applicant initially claimed to be paying the collection \nagent $100 per month, but eventually he chose not to make the payments after he learned \nhow creditor procedures work. He initially stated that he intended to wait for \u201cdebt \nforgiveness\u201d until the debt is written off, but if that does not occur by December 2019, he \nintended to pay it off in full with one lump sum at that time. He subsequently changed his \nposition, claiming that the account was \u201cfalsely added and removed from collection credit \nreport.\u201d (Item 7, at 11; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 45; Item 4, at 2; Item 6, at 5)  \nIt is noted that despite Applicant\u2019s claimed inability to maintain the six student-loan \naccounts alleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he \nmanaged to take a variety of personal trips, outside of government travel, to Morocco, \nSpain, and Turkey in June 2016; the Netherlands in May 2017; Greece in July 2017; \nGhana in September 2017; and the United Kingdom in December 2017. (Item 5, at 28-\n37) Furthermore, while Applicant generally referred to insufficient funds as his explanation \nfor failing to maintain his student loans in a current status, it appears that he may have \nhad sufficient funds to make the one promised lump-sum payment of $35,992, but merely \nchose not to do so. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$71,955. Applicant initially claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those \naccounts in a current status. It eventually appeared that he had the ability to pay the \n$35,992 student loan off in full with one lump sum payment in December 2019. As of the \ndate the record closed, he had not resolved any of those delinquent accounts. Because \nof the conflicting nature of Applicant\u2019s stated positions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) \nhave been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent student-loan \naccounts for several years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and \nit is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nattributed his financial issues to a variety of factors: his estimated combined total of one \nyear of unemployment; his separation and divorce; and his ex-wife\u2019s financial issues that \nhe felt obligated to try to help her with while forgoing his own financial issues. As noted \nabove, he failed to specify the negative impact his separation and divorce had on his \nfinances, or what the specific issues were regarding her finances, and what bills he paid \nfor her. It is also troubling that although Applicant initially claimed that he had insufficient \nfunds to maintain his accounts in a current status, he managed to take several personal \ntrips aboard in 2016 and 2017, and he later claimed to have sufficient funds to make a \nlump-sum payment of $35,992 in December 2019, something he failed to do. \n \nBased on the developed evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to \nignore his student-loan obligations: he did so with the loan with the unpaid balance of \n$23,026 that was charged off, claiming that he is no longer responsible for it; and he did \nso with the loan with an unpaid balance of $35,992 that he intended to wait for \u201cdebt \nforgiveness\u201d until the debt is written off. A \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is merely an accounting \nentry. A creditor considers a debt owed to the creditor to be an asset, but when the value \nof the asset is in doubt, the creditor is required to change the status of the debt to reflect \nits current status. When the debt appears to be uncollectible, the creditor can alter the \nstatus for accounting purposes from being an asset to charged-off status. Notwithstanding \nthe change to charged-off status, a creditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, \nand the debtor may still pay or settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-off debts will be \ndropped from the debtor\u2019s credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] \ncredit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at \n3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). \n \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items \nfrom a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. (Title 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-\nfair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.) Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit reports is not reason \nto believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)). \n \nMoreover, the Appeal Board has routinely held that a debtor\u2019s obligations are not \ndischarged as a result of actions taken by the creditor such as the sale of a debt or a \ncharge-off of the account.  \u201c[A] creditor\u2019s choice to charge-off a debt for accounting \npurposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligation to the creditor.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-02760 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 09-01175 at 2, n. 1 \n(App. Bd. May 11, 2010)).  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in April 2018; underwent his OPM interview in November 2018; and \nthe SOR was issued in May 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process \nplaced him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. Other than \nhis unverified claims that he was making some payments to a creditor which he later \nstopped making, and that he would make a lump-sum payment to another creditor in \nDecember 2019, he offered zero documentary evidence to either support his claims, or \nto reflect that he had made any efforts to resolve his delinquent student-loan accounts. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant stated that he was no \nlonger responsible for one debt, but stated that he intended to resolve another debt in \nDecember 2019. His promises appear to be hollow, for there is no evidence that he ever \nfollowed through with them. \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nfield and service mechanic with his current employer since March 2018. He served as an \naircraft mechanic for another company from April 2017 until March 2018. He previously \nserved in an enlisted status with the U.S. Air Force on active duty from May 2008 until \nMay 2014, when he was honorably discharged. He was apparently granted a secret \nclearance in 2008. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has six delinquent student-loan accounts totaling \napproximately $71,955. He intentionally chose to ignore one student-loan that was \ncharged off, claiming that he is no longer responsible for it; and he did so with another \nloan because he intended to wait for \u201cdebt forgiveness\u201d until the debt is written off. And, \nalthough he claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current \nstatus, he managed to take several personal trips overseas, outside of government travel, \nin 2016 and 2017. Moreover, he later claimed to have sufficient funds to make a lump-\nsum payment of $35,992 in December 2019, something he failed to do. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s unverified claims regarding certain payments that were \nreportedly made and eventually stopped, there is no documentary evidence to indicate \nthat any of Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans have been addressed. In fact, he denied \nresponsibility for one student loan because it had been charged off, and he was waiting \nfor another student loan to be written off. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his June 19, 2018 SCA by responding negatively to inquiries concerning whether, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed (SOR \u00b6 2.a). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and asserted they arose to pay for expenses he incurred while he owned a liquor store business that failed. He explained that he was then unemployed for about a year before taking minimum wage jobs. Applicant had an attorney attempting to negotiate settlements for the debts. Applicant responded \u201cAdmit\u201d to the Guideline E allegation, but explained in an affidavit that he would never willingly falsify and that he misunderstood the questions on the SCA. (Item 1.) After considering Items 1 through 5, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 1), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 65 years old and a native of Afghanistan.

In \nDecember 2019, he reached settlement agreements for two of the debts, but he has not \nmade any payments. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal conduct security concerns were not established because Applicant did not \ndeliberately falsify his security clearance application (SCA). Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \n\n2 \n \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 16, 2019, while working as a linguist for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a decision on the written record \nwithout a hearing. On November 22, 2019, the Government submitted a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 5. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and \ninstructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the \nFORM on December 7, 2019. Applicant responded to the FORM on January 7, 2020. On \nJanuary 16, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government had no objection to \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM. On January 24, 2020, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on February 3, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 3 a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on July 30, 2018. The summary report was part of \nthe DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview is being provided to the Administrative Judge for \nconsideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your response to \nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on whether the PSI \nsummary accurately reflects the information you provided to the authorized \nOPM investigator(s) and you can make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nand updates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate. \nAlternatively, you can object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated \nby a Government witness. If no objections are raised in your response to the \nFORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the Administrative Judge may \n\n3 \n \ndetermine that you have waived any objections to the admissibility of the \nsummary and may consider the summary as evidence in your case. \n \nApplicant did not mention the PSI in his response to the FORM. Concerning whether \nApplicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, \nApplicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond \nthose afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of \nthe Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or \nproven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide \nfor a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of \nhis opportunity to object to the admissibility of the PSI, to comment on the PSI, and to \nmake any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the PSI. Applicant is \ndeemed to have waived any objections to the PSI. \n \nAccordingly, Items 1 through 5 were accepted into the record as exhibits for the \nGovernment. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of July 26, 2019, Applicant owes \ncharged-off credit-card debts of $22,580 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $11,737 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and $7,953 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a collection debt of $8,096 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, Applicant is \nalleged to have falsified his June 19, 2018 SCA by responding negatively to inquiries \nconcerning whether, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency, and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed (SOR \u00b6 2.a). (Item 1.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and asserted they arose \nto pay for expenses he incurred while he owned a liquor store business that failed. He \nexplained that he was then unemployed for about a year before taking minimum wage jobs. \nApplicant had an attorney attempting to negotiate settlements for the debts. Applicant \nresponded \u201cAdmit\u201d to the Guideline E allegation, but explained in an affidavit that he would \nnever willingly falsify and that he misunderstood the questions on the SCA. (Item 1.) After \nconsidering Items 1 through 5, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 1), \nand Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 65 years old and a native of Afghanistan. Applicant and his spouse \nmarried in October 1978. They have two grown children ages 38 and 33. Applicant, his \nspouse, and son came to the United States in February 1985 seeking asylum. In May \n2000, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Items 2-3.) \n \nFrom October 1992 to July 2009, Applicant was managing partner of a wholesale \nbusiness until it closed. From July 2009 to November 2009, Applicant worked for his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, as a linguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. military. \n\n4 \n \n(Item 2.) He lost his job after he had left his post to get some food with two co-workers. \nApplicant knew he was not supposed to leave his post, but he had seen others leaving, \nand he was only off the post for 10 to 15 minutes. (Item 3.) Applicant explained on his \nSCA, and to an OPM investigator on July 30, 2018, that he was also having problems at \nhome at the time. (Items 2-3.) \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant explained that he had purchased a liquor \nstore for $300,000 in 2010 with all his savings and a loan obtained from refinancing the \nmortgage on his home. (Item 1.) Available financial information indicates that Applicant \npaid off the $81,933 mortgage on his home and obtained a new mortgage of $150,000 in \nJuly 2010, to be repaid at $2,323 per month. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant inaccurately reported on his SCA that he worked for his spouse only from \nJanuary 2011 to November 2011. (Item 2.) He apparently managed his spouse\u2019s liquor \nstore on his return from Afghanistan. Applicant explained that the liquor store was in a bad \nlocation with low customer traffic, and that almost from the beginning, he \u201chad a hard time \nrunning the store.\u201d Applicant was new to the business, and he lacked knowledge about \ninventory and customer preferences. Almost from the start, he relied on his personal credit \nto stock inventory for the business. He also used his credit cards to pay personal \nexpenses, which included monthly expenses of $2,323 for his mortgage, $500 for utilities, \n$200 for phone service, $1,000 for groceries, and $300 for car insurance. Applicant paid \nthe monthly minimums on his credit cards for awhile. (Item 1.) He defaulted on four credit-\ncard accounts between September 2014 and September 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). (Item 4.) \nIn approximately 2015, he and his spouse sold the liquor store. According to Applicant, he \n\u201creceived very little money for the store and had to practically give it away just to stop [him] \nhaving to use [his] credit cards anymore.\u201d Applicant asserts that he could not find another \njob for over a year. (Item 1.) On his June 2018 SCA, Applicant indicated that he held two \npart-time jobs from August 2016 to May 2018, as a front-desk clerk at a motel and as a \ncashier at a convenience store. (Item 2.) \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant retained an attorney to negotiate settlements for his four \nseriously delinquent credit-card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). Applicant had a little money \nfrom his minimum-wage jobs to make small payments. (Item 1.) In mid-January 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s attorney faxed letters to Applicant\u2019s creditors for three of Applicant\u2019s debts, \nindicating that Applicant could pay ten percent of his balances in settlement, so $1,173 on \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, $809 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and $795 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nAccording to Applicant, his largest debt of $22,580 had not yet been referred to collections, \nso his attorney did not propose a settlement at that time. However, Applicant could not pay \nthe amounts that his credit lenders wanted to settle his debts. (Item 1.) \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant applied for a linguist position with his current employer. On \nJune 18, 2018, Applicant completed a personal financial statement on which he listed net \nmonthly income totaling $4,600 for him and his spouse. After paying their monthly \nexpenses of $2,050 and $2,300 for their mortgage, they had $250 in monthly discretionary \nincome. Applicant listed two accounts other than his mortgage which were current: a credit \ncard with a $2,972 balance and an account with a $180 balance. He reported no monthly \n\n5 \n \npayment on those debts. He also listed the four delinquent accounts in the SOR totaling \n$50,366. The personal financial statement included a remark that \u201cCANDIDATE is in \ncontact with the creditors for HIS unresolved debt.\u201d (Item 5.) \n \nOn June 19, 2018, he completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA. He \nresponded negatively to the SCA inquiries into any delinquency involving routine accounts, \nincluding the following: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency? (Include financial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as \nwell as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor); \n \nIn the last seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? (Include financial \nobligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for which you \nwere a cosigner or guarantor); and \n \nYou are currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt? Include financial \nobligations for which you are the sole debtor, as well as those for which you \nare a cosigner or guarantor). \n \n \nApplicant listed some foreign travel on his SCA, including to Germany in July 2016 \nto visit family, and to Mexico in August 2017, reportedly for volunteer purposes. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on July 30, 2018. He told the \ninvestigator that he worked at his spouse\u2019s liquor store until August 2016 when the \nbusiness closed. He explained that he had not yet started working as a linguist. About his \ntrip to Mexico, Applicant stated that it was a pleasure trip with family and that he had been \nmistaken when he listed it as a volunteer trip. A review of his U.S. passport showed that he \ntraveled to Germany in April 2010, February 2011, August 2011, May 2012, August 2012, \nSeptember 2013, and July 2015. When asked about any financial problems, Applicant \nacknowledged that because of his spouse\u2019s liquor store not being profitable, he has been \nlate about six months on the credit-card accounts with the lenders identified in the SOR, \nbut that he has contacted the creditors and advised them that he would contact them about \nrepayment arrangements once he began working with his employer. He explained that the \ncredit cards were used for his spouse\u2019s liquor business. (Item 3.) There is no indication in \nthe record that Applicant was asked why he had not disclosed the delinquencies on his \nSCA. \n \n \nAs of April 17, 2019, Applicant owed charged-off credit-card balances of $22,580 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a, no activity since September 2014); $11,737 (SOR \u00b6 1.b, no activity since \nSeptember 2015); and $7,953 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, no activity since November 2014). Additionally, \n$8,096 was owed on a credit-card account placed for collection in October 2016 due to \ninactivity since February 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Item 4.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nOn a date not specified in the record, Applicant began working as a linguist in \nAfghanistan for his employer. He was apparently granted a DOD clearance because he \nasks that his security clearance not be revoked. (Item 1.) After Applicant received the SOR, \nhe retained the services of his attorney to again enter into settlement negotiations for him \nwith his creditors. Applicant\u2019s attorney faxed letters to Applicant\u2019s creditors offering \nsettlements of ten percent of Applicant\u2019s outstanding balances. The creditor owed the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b countered by asking for half of Applicant\u2019s balances. The \nattorney then offered settlement terms of 20 percent. If that offer was rejected by the \ncreditor, Applicant\u2019s attorney planned to offer a settlement amount of 25 percent \u201cas a full \nand final offer.\u201d The collection entity for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c could not locate the file. The \ncreditor owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d demanded full payment of Applicant\u2019s $7,953 balance. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney countered by offering 25 percent of the debt \u201cas a full and final offer.\u201d \nAs of Applicant\u2019s August 16, 2019 response to the SOR, no settlements had been reached \non Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts. In notifying Applicant of his attempts to arrange \nsettlements, the attorney added: \n \nI have asked all the credit card companies for a written answer to our \nsettlement offer because it is important to us to prove to the judge in a \nhearing that you tried to settle the debts with the limited money you have but \nthey will not settle with you on reasonable amounts. We will also let the judge \nknow that you are trying very hard to settle but you can\u2019t make an offer for \nmore money than you actually have. (Item 1.) \n \n \nWhile working in Afghanistan, Applicant executed an affidavit in response to the \nSOR in which he expressed his intention to settle his debts because he is in a better \nfinancial situation \u201cnow working in this current job with the Department of Defense.\u201d \nApplicant stated with regard to his failure to disclose his delinquencies on his June 2018 \nSCA: \n \nI am a very honest person and would never willingly falsely answer a \nquestion on an application for employment. In regard to the [SCA], I \nmistakenly answered in the negative to the questions about current and past \ncredit debts because I did not understand the question. (Item 1.) \n \nApplicant did not elaborate in the affidavit about the nature of his reported \nmisunderstanding of the SCA inquiries. \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided a letter from the collection entity for \nthe $8,095 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) confirming that Applicant, through his attorney, arranged on \nDecember 17, 2019, to pay $5,262 by January 30, 2020, in full settlement. Applicant\u2019s \nattorney had arranged, as of December 9, 2019, for Applicant to pay $4,773 by December \n27, 2019, to settle his $7,953 balance with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant consented \nto an entry of judgment against him for the full $7,953 minus any payments if he failed to \npay the settlement amount by the deadline. In a January 7, 2020 affidavit, Applicant \nindicated that his attorney was still waiting for the creditor owed the delinquencies in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to \u201csend [its] settlement agreements on [his] two accounts before I can \n\n7 \n \nmake payments on any of the cards because I have to see if I have enough money to pay \nall these credit- card companies now.\u201d Applicant added that he needs his job as a linguist \nto make the settlement payments and that he is trying his best to save the money to make \nthe payments. Should he not have enough money to pay off the settlements in full, he asks \nthat he be given more time to make the payments \u201cor waive the requirement that [he] must \npay them off all in full in order to keep [his] job with the DOD.\u201d He asserts that he loves the \nUnited States and his job working as a linguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. military, and that \nhe is a reliable and trustworthy person who \u201cjust fell on hard times through a business loss \nand for no other reason.\u201d (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant provided no evidence of any payments toward the debts in the SOR. He \nsubmitted no information about his current income or his savings, thus precluding a \nreasonable assessment of his financial situation. No information was submitted as to \nwhether Applicant has had any financial counseling. \n    \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n8 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Between September 2014 and September 2015, \nApplicant defaulted on four credit-card accounts that presently total $50,366. Under AG \u00b6 \n19, disqualifying conditions 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n\n9 \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), although the debts have been delinquent for some time, they \nremain unresolved. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-\n06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. \n13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his spouse\u2019s failed liquor-store \nbusiness. He indicated, with no evidence to the contrary, that he used his personal credit to \npurchase inventory and cover other business expenses, and to pay household expenses \nwhen finances were tight because of the lack of income from the business. While AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is implicated because he had no control over economic conditions or customer \ndecisions, he took a risk that the business venture may not be profitable. Applicant was \napparently unemployed for a year after he and his spouse closed her business in 2015 \nbefore working two low-paying part-time jobs from August 2016 to May 2018. His \nunemployment and under-employment trigger AG \u00b6 20(b) with respect to his failure to \nmake payments on his delinquent credit cards at that time. \n \n \nEven when factors outside of his control contributed to or caused his financial \nproblems, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when \ndealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n\n10 \n \n2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors. Applicant \nretained an attorney in January 2017 to negotiate settlement terms with his creditors. The \nattorney proposed settlements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d that were not accepted by \nApplicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant acted responsibly in that regard, and he had no control over \nwhether the creditors would accept payments that he could afford. However, he also took a \nfamily vacation to Mexico in August 2017, when he reportedly could not afford to settle his \ndebts. There is no documentation of any ongoing efforts on his part to address his debts \nafter January 2017 until August 2019, when he again retained the services of the attorney \nto negotiate settlements on his behalf. When he completed a personal financial statement \non June 18, 2018, he indicated that he was in contact with his creditors about his \nunresolved debts. However, he provided no corroborating documentation of any such \ncontacts. Sometime between his July 30, 2018 PSI and his August 16, 2019 response to \nthe SOR, Applicant began working as a linguist in Afghanistan. Without knowing his start \ndate or his income for that employment or his income, I cannot make a reasonable finding \nas to whether he acted responsibly under his circumstances by waiting until the SOR was \nissued to resume settlement negotiations for his delinquencies. \n \n \nThe timing of resolution of financial problems is an important consideration in \nevaluating mitigation. Applicant exhibited some good faith toward his creditors under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) by attempting to settle his debts in January 2017, well before he sought security \nclearance eligibility, but he failed to show adequate justification for why he waited until the \nSOR was issued to re-engage in settlement negotiations. In ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2019), the Appeal Board stated that \u201can applicant who takes action to \nresolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her clearance is \nin jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.\u201d \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) fully applies. There is no evidence that Applicant \nhas had any credit counseling, which his required under AG \u00b6 20(c), and could assuage \nconcerns about his financial judgment raised by him incurring personal debt to keep an \nunprofitable business afloat, and taking on a higher mortgage obligation for his home to \npurchase the business. Without any payments on any of the four debts, I cannot \nreasonably conclude that \u201cthere are clear indications\u201d that his financial issues are being \nresolved. Concerning AG \u00b6 20(d), while Applicant is credited with initiating efforts to resolve \nhis debts, without evidence of any payments, it would be premature to conclude that he is \nadhering to a plan that would result in resolution of his delinquencies. \n \n \nApplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has satisfied each \ndebt in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006). \nHowever, he is required under Appeal Board precedent to demonstrate not only that he \nhas a plan to resolve his financial problems, but that he has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006.) \nApplicant indicated on January 7, 2020, that he is trying his best to save the money needed \nto settle his debts. The Appeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt in \nthe future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Applicant has yet to demonstrate a \n\n11 \n \ntrack record of timely repayment on his financial obligations to enable a predicative \njudgment that his financial problems are safely behind him. More progress is needed \ntoward reestablishing financial stability to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA on June 19, 2018, on \nwhich he responded negatively to the financial record inquiries concerning any delinquency \non routine accounts in the last seven years and denied that any of his accounts had been \ncharged off or placed for collection in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Available \ninformation establishes that he knew about the delinquencies well before his SCA because \nhe retained an attorney to help him negotiate settlements in January 2017. A reasonable \ninference of deliberate falsification of his SCA could be drawn because of the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. There had been no activity on any of the accounts since September 2015. \nAlthough Applicant does not dispute that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the financial record inquiries, \nhe asserts that he misunderstood the question and did not willfully falsify his SCA. Thus, I \nfind that the falsification allegation is controverted. \n  \n \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shift to the applicant to present evidence \nto explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, \n2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \n \nThe delinquency dates for the accounts are sufficient to shift the burden to Applicant \nto explain his inaccurate denial to the SCA queries concerning any delinquency involving \nroutine accounts. Applicant did not elaborate as to his claimed misunderstanding of the \n\n12 \n \nquestion. In viewing the evidence as a whole, I note that, on June 18, 2019, the day before \nApplicant completed his SCA, he submitted as a \u201ccandidate\u201d a personal financial statement \n(Item 5) on which he listed the four delinquent credit-card debts and their balances totaling \n$50,366. He indicated that he was making no payments on the debts but that he was in \ncontact with the creditors. Although this did not relieve him of his obligation to report the \ndebts on his SCA, it supports his denial of any intentional falsification of his SCA. The \nevidence falls short of establishing intentional concealment needed under AG \u00b6 16(a), \nwhich does not apply when omissions are due to mistake, lack of recall, or other reason \nnegating willful intent. AG \u00b6 16(a) provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns related to deliberate falsification are not \nsufficiently proven. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nsubmit evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his financial \ndelinquencies. Applicant did not provide information about his current savings or income \nfrom which I could conclude that he will be able to settle his past-due debts in the near \nfuture. Two creditors had agreed to settle his debts for reduced balances. The payment to \nsettle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was not due until January 30, 2020, after the deadline for his \nresponse to the FORM. However, his payment of $4,773 to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nwas due by December 27, 2019. He provided no evidence of any payment with his January \n7, 2020 response to the FORM. \n \nApplicant certainly deserves credit for his work for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. \nHowever, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \n\n13 \n \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility \nfor Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 10, 2017. On July 31, \n2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines B and F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 3, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December \n23, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on January 9, 2020. On January 24, 2020, \n\n \n2 \n \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas scheduled for February 10, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 6, which \nconsisted of several summaries of interviews conducted by security investigators, was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and was not admitted. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through DD, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I kept the record open until February 26, 2020, to enable him to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX EE through OO, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 19, 2020. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iraq. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.) I took administrative notice as requested. On my own \nmotion and without objection from either party, I took administrative notice of the facts \nrecited in the U.S. Department of State fact sheet, U.S. Relations with Iraq (November \n13, 2019) (HX II.) The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of \nfact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since May \n2011. He is seeking to work on a contract that requires a security clearance.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B, based on Applicant\u2019s family \nconnections to Iraq. He was born in Iraq. He married an Iraqi woman in January 2007. \nHis wife is now a U.S. citizen. They have two children, ages 11 and 6, who are native-\nborn U.S. citizens. \n \n \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor and served with U.S. Forces in \nIraq from February 2006 to October 2008. He was involved in direct combat and \nparticipated in numerous security missions, reconnaissance missions, and prisoner \napprehensions. He received numerous accolades and certificates attesting to his hard \nwork, bravery, reliability, and dedication. The Army officers and noncommissioned officers \nwith whom he served strongly supported his application for a special immigrant visa. (AX \nA through AX L; AX T through Y; AX Z.)  \n \nApplicant, his mother, his wife, and his youngest sister came to the United States \nin October 2008 on a special immigrant visa. He and his family lived in the United States \nwith the U.S. Army captain for whom he worked in Iraq. (Tr. 41.) His mother and sister \n\n \n3 \n \nreturned to Iraq after living in the United States for about 11 months. (Tr. 45, 57.) He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in January 2014.  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant decided to enlist in the U.S. Army as a linguist. He took the \nArmed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery twice and failed it. He passed on the third \ntry. Before he could enlist, his wife was hospitalized and disabled for several months. \nInstead of enlisting, he applied for a linguist position with a defense contractor and was \nhired. (Tr. 125-29.)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed by this defense contractor from September 2009 to July \n2011. He worked intermittently as a cultural role player during pre-deployment training in \nthe United States for U.S. Army units on their way to Iraq. (GX 1 at 16-17.) He again \nreceived numerous certificates of appreciation for his dedication and service. (AX N \nthrough R; AX OO.) \n \n \nFrom May 2011 to May 2017, Applicant was employed by a federal contractor as \nan audio technician operating a broadcasting system for another government agency \n(AGA). He was commended for his skill, dedication, and teamwork. (AX OO.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, three sisters, uncle, two brothers-in-law, and mother-\nin-law, are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father served as a bandsman in the Iraqi \nArmy, retired with a pension, and is now deceased. (Tr. 47.). Applicant has monthly \ncontact with his mother by social media. (Tr. 45.) She is supported by his father\u2019s military \npension. (Tr.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is employed by the Iraq Ministry of Interior, was trained by U.S. \nForces in 2005, and works as an unarmed security officer for the Facilities Protection \nService in Iraq. Applicant talks to his brother between two times and four times a year by \nsocial media. (Tr. 50.) \n \nApplicant has had no contact with his oldest sister since he visited her in Iraq in \n2014. The lack of contact is due to a poor relationship between her and Applicant\u2019s wife. \n(Tr. 52.) He talks to his middle sister two or three times a year. His last contact with his \nyoungest sister was in 2014, when she returned to Iraq.  \n \nApplicant has had no personal contact with his mother-in-law and brothers-in-law \nsince 2014. His last personal contact with his uncle was in 2017, when his uncle visited \nthe United States in connection with personal business in Iraq. (Tr. 59.) Applicant \ncommunicates with his uncle about twice a year by text message. (Tr. 61.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to her mother and one of her sisters in Iraq about twice a \nweek. His wife\u2019s other sister lives in Turkey. Applicant exchanges greetings with his wife\u2019s \nmother about twice a year. He last visited her in person in 2014. (Tr. 62-63, 65-66.) \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers-in-law is a teacher in an Iraqi government school. His \nwife talks to her brother about once a month, and Applicant exchanges greetings with him \n\n \n4 \n \noccasionally. (Tr. 67.) Applicant\u2019s other brother-in-law owns a small grocery store. \nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to this brother-in-law about once a month, and Applicant exchanges \ngreetings with him about once a year. (Tr. 69.)  \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraqi parliamentary elections in 2014 \ngenerally met international standards of free and fair elections and led to a peaceful \ntransition of power. The United States regards Iraq as a key partner in the region as well \nas a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East, and it maintains vigorous \nand broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues. \nU.S. assistance to Iraq focuses on economic reform, assistance to vulnerable groups, \ndemocracy, and governance. U.S. security assistance supports the development of a \nmodern, accountable, fiscally sustainable, and professional Iraqi military capable of \ndefending Iraq and its borders. \n \nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization that \ncontrols some areas of Syria on the Iraqi border and remains a threat to public safety in \nIraq through indiscriminate terrorist attacks. ISIS, criminal gangs, and local militias pose \na potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests. The Department of State travel advisory \nfor Iraq is Level 4: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.\u201d \n \nIraq\u2019s most significant human rights issues include allegations of unlawful killings \nby some members of the Iraqi Security Forces, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary \ndetention, and widespread official corruption. Iraqi citizens are not eligible for travel to the \nUnited States under the Visa Waiver program, which permits citizens of certain countries \nto travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $56,779. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from March 2017, May 2017, and April 2019. (GX 3, 4 and 5.) \n \n Applicant testified that his financial problems began in 2017, when his income was \ndrastically reduced. He had been working for a contractor supporting an AGA. He worked \nat night, earning a night differential, and working overtime. He earned $84,000 in 2014 \nand $73,000 in 2015. Due to budget cuts, his employer stopped his night work and \novertime, reducing his annual income to about $31,800. (Tr. 104-09.) When his pay was \nreduced, he kept his house payments current but fell behind on his other debts. (GX 4 at \n1; GX 5 at 1.) He hired a credit-repair company in April 2018. (Enclosure to SOR answer.) \nHe terminated his contract with the company after paying $110 per month for three \nmonths and decided to deal directly with his creditors. (Tr. 114-15.) The evidence \nconcerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: credit-card account charged off for $6,187. Applicant opened this \naccount in October 2011. It was charged off in June 2017. (GX 4 at 2.) He made a \npayment agreement in August 2018 providing for monthly $100 payments. (Attachment \nto SOR answer.) His payments were current through February 10, 2020. (AX EE.)  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: electronics bill referred for collection of $1,980. Applicant testified \nthat he believed this debt was for a cellphone. (Tr. 77.) It was referred for collection in \nDecember 2017. (GX 4 at 2.) He made a payment agreement with the collection agency \nfor this debt and settled it for less than the full amount on February 11, 2020. (AX FF.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: collection account for $624. Applicant testified that this debt was for \nthe purchase of a lawn mower. The account was opened in December 2014 and charged \noff in July 2016. (GX 3 at 4.) In October 2017, it was referred to the same collection \nagency as the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, and it was settled on February 11, 2020. (Tr. \n77; AX FF.)   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: automobile lease referred for collection of $24,965. Applicant \ntestified that he purchased a car for $35,000 with a six-year loan. He was advised by an \nunidentified person that he should lease a car instead of buying one. In 2012, he traded \nin his $35,000 car and leased a luxury car for three years. (Tr. 33; GX 5 at 3.) He had a \ndispute with the dealership about a $2,300 repair that he thought should covered by the \nwarranty. He stopped making payments and the car was repossessed in September \n2015. (Tr. 81-83; GX 5 at 1.) In his answer to the SOR, he submitted evidence that he \nreceived a settlement offer in February 2019, and he settled the debt in April 2019 for less \nthan the full amount.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: electronics bill referred for collection of $2,089. This debt was for \nthe purchase of a television. It was charged off in February 2016 and was referred to the \nsame collection agency as the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. (GX 3 at 3.) He \nsettled this debt for less than the full amount in March 2019. (Enclosure to SOR answer.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.f: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,619. This account \nwas opened in February 2012 and charged off in August 2016. (GX 4 at 2.) It was settled \nfor less than the full amount on February 11, 2020. (AX NN.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.g: department store account charged off for $1,382. This was opened \nin August 2011 and charged off in September 2016. (GX 3 at 4.) It was settled in \nSeptember 2018. (AX II.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.h: home improvement store account charged off for $427. This \naccount was opened in December 2014 and charged off in July 2016. (GX3 at 4.) In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he submitted documentation of a settlement offer he \nreceived and accepted in April 2019. He paid the final installment of $156.77 on February \n11, 2020. (AX JJ.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.i: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,979. This debt is a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. (AX FF.). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.j: credit-card account referred for collection of $15,527. This account \nwas opened in April 2010 and referred for collection in December 2015. (GX 3 at 3.) \nApplicant settled this debt for less than the full amount in September 2018. (AX KK.) The \n\n \n6 \n \ncreditor cancelled $13,826 of the debt. Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C reflecting \nthe cancelled portion of the debt, and he reported it as income on his tax return for 2018. \n(Tr. 96-97; AX LL.)  \n \n \nApplicant is currently employed full time by a local county as an assistant \nbroadcast engineer at an annual salary of $75,000. He also has two part-time jobs as a \nfreelance contractor for an AGA, from which he expects to earn about $30,000 per year. \n(Tr. 100-02.) He has about $50,000 in savings that he has accumulated since 2018. (Tr. \n104.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \n\n \n8 \n \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. When foreign family ties are at issue, \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual \nfamily tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. While Iraq and the United States are allies \nand share many common goals, the activities of terrorists, criminal gangs, and local \nmilitias in Iraq are sufficient to raise the heightened risk in AG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential \nconflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e) is established. Although Applicant\u2019s wife is a U.S. citizen, she has \nnumerous immediate family members in Iraq. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a \nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the \nperson's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR \nCase No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s multiple family ties to immediate family \nmembers and his wife\u2019s family ties preclude a finding that a conflict of interest is unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant served with distinction in combat operations \nwith U.S. forces from February 2009 to July 2011. He and his family were granted special \nimmigrant visas because of his service. He worked as a contractor for an AGA from May \n2011 to May 2017. He sought to enlist in the U.S. Army as a linguist until his plans were \nderailed by his wife\u2019s injury and disability. He owns a home in the United States. His wife \nand children are U.S. citizens. He served with distinction in support of U.S. forces on \nsensitive missions in a combat zone. His deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in U.S. are such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. He \u201chas established by credible, independent evidence that \nhis compliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which [he] had made a significant contribution to \nthe national security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not fully established. Applicant has not overcome the presumption that \ncommunications with immediate family members are not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). However, this mitigating condition is established for \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his uncle, mother-in-law, and brothers-in-law. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n10 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.i are duplicates. When the same conduct \nis alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.i for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his history of delinquent debts reflected in his credit \nreports from March 2017, May 2017, and April 2019 are sufficient to establish following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \n\n \n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are established. Applicant\u2019s drastic pay reduction in 2016 \nwas a condition beyond his control, and he has acted responsibly. Although his income \nhas fluctuated and some jobs have been intermittent, he has been employed continuously \nsince his pay reduction, frequently working in multiple part-time jobs simultaneously. He \ninitiated a payment agreement for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a in August 2018. He \nsettled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.j in September 2018. He settled the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e in March 2019 and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d in April 2019. He \nresolved all these debts before he received the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant did not fully resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.f, and 2.h \nuntil February 11, 2020, four days after the hearing. However, the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \npay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the \nSOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Applicant has been systematically addressing his debts since at least August \n2018. He has succeeded in resolving all the debts alleged in the SOR. He is gainfully \nemployed in one full-time job and two part-time jobs and has accumulated substantial \nsavings.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s brief contract with a credit-repair \ncompany did not provide the type of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating \ncondition. However, there are \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial situation is under \ncontrol. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n12 \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. In 2014 and 2015, he found himself earning more money than he had previously \nexperienced, and he rewarded himself and his family with expensive purchases. He \nlearned his lesson after his pay reduction and the resulting financial distress. He is now \nfinancially secure.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 4), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 47 years old. He has been married to his spouse since November 1997. They have two sons, ages 20 and 18, and a daughter age 14. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1995 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2002. He has spent his career in software engineering for the U.S. defense industry, holding positions of increasing responsibility for a succession of defense contractors. Since April 1, 2014, he has been employed as vice president of a small business providing services to the DOD intelligence community. (Items 5, 13.) He held a DOD clearance dating back to September 29, 1998, and was granted sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility by AGA on March 28, 2014. (Item 8.) As of the September 2019 FORM, he held a Top Secret clearance. (Item 13.) His SCI access eligibility was revoked on September 4, 2018, for the conduct alleged in the SOR. (Items 9, 12.) To renew his SCI access eligibility, Applicant had a polygraph in May 2018 that was apparently inconclusive. (Items 6, 13.) Applicant was then re-tested by AGA on June 18, 2018. During pre-polygraph questioning, Applicant felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to disclose an incident that happened around November or December 2005. He related that he was at home alone with his two or three-month-old daughter and watching television, when, for some unknown reason, he exposed his pe",

In approximately 2006, he attempted to lure a neighbor\u2019s 15 or 16-year-old \ndaughter to his basement with the intent of kissing and, if she consented, also fondling \nher. A 2018 clinical evaluation was negative for pedophilia, but it is undermined by \nApplicant\u2019s failure to be fully candid about his sexual behaviors with the clinician. \nApplicant also misrepresented the circumstances of his sexual misconduct involving his \ndaughter during a pre-polygraph interview for another government agency (AGA). \nClearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline D (sexual behavior). The \nSOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \n\n2 \n \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 19, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), referencing 13 exhibits (Items \n1-13). On September 20, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him that any response was \ndue within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on September 25, 2019. No \nresponse was received by the October 25, 2019 deadline. On January 8, 2020, the case \nwas assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the \ncase file on January 13, 2020.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 13, summary reports of personal subject \ninterviews (PSI) of Applicant conducted on January 3, 2019, and February 8, 2019. The \nsummary reports were part of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise \nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary reports did not bear the \nauthentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal \nBoard held that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a \nsummary of personal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his \nor her opportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no \nobjection to it; and there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate \ninformation. In this case, Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his \nopportunity to submit objections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to \nconsider. In the FORM, Applicant was advised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary(s) of your \nPersonal Subject Interview(s) is/are being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on \nwhether the summary(s) of your Personal Subject Interview(s) accurately \nreflect(s) the information you provided to the authorized OPM \ninvestigator(s) and you can make any corrections, additions, deletions, and \nupdates necessary to make the summary(s) clear and accurate. \nAlternatively, you can object on the ground that the report(s) is/are \nunauthenticated by a Government witness and the document may not be \n\n3 \n \nconsidered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your response to the \nFORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the Administrative Judge may \ndetermine that you have waived any objections to the admissibility of the \nsummary(s) and may consider the summary(s) as evidence in your case. \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. Concerning whether Applicant understood \nthe meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se \nstatus does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond those afforded him \nif he was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that \nhe may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for \npresenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by \nDepartment Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a waiver \nof the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of his \nopportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary report, to comment on \nthe interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the \ninformation in the report. In the absence of any objections, I accepted Item 13 in evidence, \nsubject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Response \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1) and cross-alleges under Guideline \nD (SOR \u00b6 2.a) that Applicant searched the Internet 10 to 15 times between 2002 and \n2003 for pornographic images of females ages 15 to 17 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he placed his \npenis against the lips of his three-month-old daughter in approximately 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand that sometime between 2006 and 2008, he devised a plan, which was foiled by a text \nto his wife from the intended victim, to lure a 15 or 16-year-old neighbor to his basement \nwith the intent to kiss her, and, with consent, fondle her (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Additionally under \nGuideline E, Applicant is alleged to have intentionally omitted relevant facts concerning \nhis 2005 sexual misconduct involving his then-infant daughter (SOR \u00b6 1.d) during a \nsecurity interview by AGA in June 2018. (Item 1.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a detailed Answer in which he admitted the behaviors alleged \nin the SOR, but cited the passage of time without recurrence of the incidents; a \npsychosexual risk assessment negative for pedophilia as indication of the aberrational \nnature of his sexual misconduct involving his daughter; and a brief period of immaturity \nand poor judgment fueled by alcohol for the plan involving a then-teenage neighbor. As \nfor his alleged lack of candor concerning his sexual misconduct with his daughter, \nApplicant asserted that the incident was out of character for him and explained that he \nhad internally \u201csuppressed\u201d the incident for nearly 13 years before being \u201ccompelled\u201d to \ndivulge the information during a pre-polygraph interview. As for not revealing significant \nimplicating details about his misconduct with his daughter and denying any other \ninappropriate contact with his daughter, Applicant claimed he misunderstood the question \nof the interviewer during that interview, and he denied any intention to withhold details of \nhis behavior. He also denied any vulnerability to coercion because his spouse is aware \nof the incident involving their daughter. (Item 4.) \n\n4 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item \n4), I make the following findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He has been married to his spouse since November \n1997. They have two sons, ages 20 and 18, and a daughter age 14. Applicant earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 1995 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2002. He has spent his \ncareer in software engineering for the U.S. defense industry, holding positions of \nincreasing responsibility for a succession of defense contractors. Since April 1, 2014, he \nhas been employed as vice president of a small business providing services to the DOD \nintelligence community. (Items 5, 13.) He held a DOD clearance dating back to \nSeptember 29, 1998, and was granted sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access \neligibility by AGA on March 28, 2014. (Item 8.) As of the September 2019 FORM, he held \na Top Secret clearance. (Item 13.) His SCI access eligibility was revoked on September \n4, 2018, for the conduct alleged in the SOR. (Items 9, 12.) \n \n \nTo renew his SCI access eligibility, Applicant had a polygraph in May 2018 that \nwas apparently inconclusive. (Items 6, 13.) Applicant was then re-tested by AGA on June \n18, 2018. During pre-polygraph questioning, Applicant felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to disclose an \nincident that happened around November or December 2005. He related that he was at \nhome alone with his two or three-month-old daughter and watching television, when, for \nsome unknown reason, he exposed his penis to his daughter. He claimed to not recall if \nhe guided his daughter\u2019s hand or she acted on her own, but she grabbed his penis, and \nhe became aroused. He stated that he immediately realized the inappropriateness of his \nbehavior, pulled up his shorts, and laid his daughter on her blanket. He denied any other \ninappropriate contact with his daughter. (Items 6, 8.) \n \n \nOn June 19, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by AGA during a special \ninvestigation into the conduct involving his daughter that he had reported the previous \nday. About the incident involving his daughter in 2005, he related that he had grabbed \nthe back of his daughter\u2019s head and pulled it toward his semi-erect penis, causing her lips \nto touch his penis for one to two seconds. After his daughter pulled her head away, he \nsaid to himself, \u201cThis is not right, this is not me, I don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d and he then laid \nhis daughter on the ground without further incident. He acknowledged to AGA\u2019s \nrepresentative that he had exposed his penis with the purpose of having his daughter \nplay with it and suck it. When asked why he had not provided these details during his \nJune 18, 2018 polygraph interview, he stated that \u201c[he] did not want [AGA\u2019s polygraph \nexaminer] to know the details.\u201d Applicant then revealed that he attempted to lure a 15 or \n16-year-old female neighbor to his basement on one occasion between 2006 and 2008. \nHe recounted that during a \u201cget together with friends and neighbors,\u201d the teen had brought \na child-development doll to his house. At some point, he took the doll to his basement \nand texted the teen, telling her to come to the basement to collect the doll. The teen \ninstead showed the text to Applicant\u2019s wife, who then confronted him in their basement. \nApplicant acknowledged to AGA\u2019s representative that he had intended to kiss the \nteenager and would have fondled her if she consented. He expressed his belief that he \n\n5 \n \nwould have stopped before having sex with the teenager because of his morals. He \nexplained that he had consumed too much beer that night, which may have contributed \nto his behavior. During his June 19, 2018 interview, Applicant also stated that on 10 to 15 \noccasions between 2002 and 2003, he conducted Internet searches for teenage \npornography with the intention of viewing images of naked girls ages 15 to 17. He stated \nthat he no longer attempts to view pornography of teenage girls as he now prefers viewing \nadult lesbian pornography. He denied he could be blackmailed for any of the incidents \nbecause he would tell his wife before anyone could coerce or blackmail him. (Items 7-8.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SCI access eligibility was suspended on June 20, 2018, and revoked \non August 30, 2018, by AGA, because of his inappropriate sexual contact with his \ndaughter; his failure to discuss the full extent of that incident during his June 18, 2018 \npolygraph interview; his intentional online searches for teenage pornography; and his \nattempt to lure a teenage female neighbor into his basement with the intention to kiss \nand, if she consented, fondle her. Although the incidents happened over a decade ago, \nthey showed a concerning pattern of inappropriate and illegal behavior and occurred while \nApplicant had SCI access eligibility. (Item 8.) Applicant was notified of the access \nrevocation on September 4, 2018. (Item 9.) Applicant\u2019s inappropriate sexual contact with \nhis daughter was reported to his county\u2019s Department of Social Services (hereafter Social \nServices). (Item 10.) \n \n \nOn October 25, 2018, Applicant formally appealed the revocation of his SCI access \neligibility. In a detailed statement, he expressed his belief that the behaviors were out of \ncharacter for him and an isolated occurrence. In relating what had transpired over the \nsummer of 2018 while he was investigated by Social Services and the police for his \ninappropriate sexual contact with his daughter almost 13 years earlier, Applicant stated \nthat, on being informed by Social Services that allegations of sexual misconduct had been \nmade against him, he \u201cprovided [his wife] the details that [he] had been strictly keeping to \n[himself] for the last 12+ years,\u201d adding: \n \nFor the obvious reason of losing her forever and the only person I ever truly \ndidn\u2019t want to find out was my wife, I now had been forced to divulge this \nsecret to her. She was obviously in a state of shock . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant explained that Social Services restricted him from having any \nunsupervised contact with his children, which he obeyed, and he voluntarily at his own \nexpense underwent a psychological risk assessment by a clinician, who found no risk of \na future incident and gave him an excellent prognosis. Applicant indicated that the Social \nServices\u2019 investigation was closed with a required finding of \u201cIndicated,\u201d but that the \ncontact restriction was lifted because Social Services felt he was not a risk to his children. \nFurthermore, the state\u2019s criminal investigation ran its course without any charges being \nfiled against him. He added that the pressures and stresses that could have led to this \naberration in his behavior were no longer present in his life, and he lived through situations \nof higher pressure and stress without incident. As to any vulnerability concerns, Applicant \nstated: \n \n\n6 \n \n[His and his spouse\u2019s] relationship and bond are stronger than ever and \ncontinues to grow each day. I had chosen to bury this inside of me, intending \nfor it to be buried forever, because I did not want to lose my wife and family. \nAfter it resurfaced during my polygraph, I had no other alternative but to tell \nmy wife and select others in a need-to-know capacity and was ready to live \nwith the consequences. There is no one else in this world that I fear finding \nout about any of this. Those who I care the most about know, they still love \nand support me and that is enough for me. In my opinion, at this point, this \nbehavior cannot be used against me in a coercive or blackmailing fashion. \n. . . Although any behavior of this kind is uncalled for and extremely \ninappropriate, it was behavior that never escalated, it was minor on the \nscale of such incidents, and this behavior has never occurred again. \nLikewise, I have alleviated any concern of coercion and exploitation by \nrevealing this behavior to those who need to know and anyone else who \nlearns of this is of no consequence to me. (Item 10.) \n \nOn November 26, 2018, AGA sustained the revocation of Applicant\u2019s SCI access \neligibility. (Items 11-12.) \n \n \nOn December 10, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for an investigation into whether he \nshould retain his Top Secret clearance. Applicant disclosed the revocation of his SCI \naccess eligibility on his SF 86, stating: \n \n[AGA] revoked my SCI access based on something I mentioned before my \nlast CI [counterintelligence] polygraph. I had buried something from my \npersonal life, not security-related nor work-related, that had happened more \nthan 13 years ago. Based on something the polygraph technician said \nbefore starting the test, brought this back to my memory. I felt compelled to \ntell her at this point because I feared it would cause inaccurate results on \nmy polygraph examination. Subsequently, I did pass that CI polygraph that \nday, but mentioning this personal matter resulted in the suspension of my \nSCI access pending further investigation. Following investigation, I was \ninformed that my SCI was being revoked because they questioned my \nintegrity and character for keeping this completely buried within me and \nkeeping it from them for so long. This is the only blemish on my otherwise \nimpeccable character and level of integrity. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on January 3, 2019. He explained about his SCI access revocation \nthat he was asked a personal question during a polygraph that brought back a negative \nmemory of an issue from 13 years ago. He stated that he divulged all information that \nwas asked of him and passed the polygraph, and that after his SCI access was \nsuspended, he was moved to a new role at work involving business development and \nstaffing that did not require SCI access eligibility. Applicant indicated that he had many \npolygraphs for AGA over the years, and the issue had not previously come up. Applicant \n\n7 \n \ndeclined to discuss the specifics of the incident with the OPM investigator beyond that it \nwas sexual in nature. He identified his spouse and four current co-workers as the only \npeople who know his SCI access eligibility has been revoked. He stated that only the \npeople that need to know what happened are aware of what happened, and asserted the \nissue in question would never happen again. (Item 13.)  \n \n \nOn February 8, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a different OPM investigator. \nHe responded negatively to whether he has had any sexual contact with his daughter \nsince the 2005 incident, but admitted that nobody knew about the incident before his June \n18, 2018 polygraph examination. He stated that his spouse was made aware of the \nincident after his polygraph. As for his behavior involving the underage teen neighbor, \nApplicant stated that the girl was babysitting at his home when he returned with his \nspouse. He was intoxicated and texted the teen from his basement, asking her to come \nmeet him. The teen showed his wife the text message, and his wife confronted him. \nApplicant denied any other such incidents involving the teen. Regarding his online \nsearches for pornography, he explained that he focused on 15 to 17-year-old females, \nand attributed his conduct to immaturity. He denied conducting any similar searches since \nhe stopped, sometime between the births of his first and second children. Applicant \nadmitted that his spouse was unaware of his online pornographic searches, but he \nbelieved she would attribute his searches for teen porn to where he was in his life at the \ntime. He surmised that his relationship with his neighbors would probably be altered if \nthey learned of the activity, but denied he could be blackmailed or coerced because his \nspouse knows of his past poor judgment and has accepted it. He indicated that he would \nnot be concerned if others became aware, because the behavior was in the past and he \nis prepared to go forward. When asked why he had not been fully forthcoming about his \nsexual behavior during his polygraph interview with AGA on June 18, 2018, Applicant \nresponded that he did not believe the information was pertinent to the investigation \nbecause it was personal in nature and had occurred so long ago. He admitted that that \nhe had not told his wife about the incident with his daughter at the time it occurred \nbecause he was fearful of her reaction. (Item 13.) \n \n \nOn June 26, 2019, the DOD CAF issued the SOR (Item 1), which was received by \nApplicant on July 16, 2019. (Item 3.) In his August 2, 2019 Answer, Applicant described \nhis Internet searches for nude female minors as not appropriate and immature behavior \nthat was out of character for him. He stated that he has not searched for any type of \npornography in more than 16 years as it no longer interested him. He also stated that he \nhad \u201cno explanation, only remorse\u201d for his sexual contact with his daughter, and he cited \na psychological risk assessment negative for pedophilia as evidence that the behavior \nwas an aberration. He denied any risk of recurrence, explaining that since the Social \nServices\u2019 investigation of summer 2018, he has \u201cleaned harder into [his] faith, [and] \nsurrounded [himself] with positivity to best guide [him] through good, bad and indifferent \ntimes of [his] life.\u201d Concerning the incident with the teenage neighbor, Applicant related \nthat on \u201cdeeper recollection, it was more closely aligned with early 2006,\u201d and that it was \n\u201cpotentially fostered by having more alcoholic drinks than appropriate on the evening in \nquestion.\u201d He expressed his belief that he would not have [sexually] acted on the incident \nhad the teen \u201centertained [his] shenanigans and come to the basement.\u201d Applicant cited \n\n8 \n \nhis maturity since \u201cthis moment of poor (and inebriated) judgment\u201d as proof it would not \nrecur. Regarding his alleged failure to be fully forthcoming during his polygraph interview \nwith AGA, Applicant stated: \n \nThe \u201cdenial to the investigator\u201d described in 1.d [of the SOR] was not denial, \nbut a misinterpretation of the question on my part. My interpretation of her \nquestion was that there was no \u201cother inappropriate contact\u201d outside of this \nincident as a whole. There was no preconceived notion of being deceptive \nor purposely withholding any details. The incident had rushed back into my \nhead prior to the start of the examination, I felt it was necessary to reveal \nthe incident in order to clear my mind and focus on the task at hand; the CI \npolygraph. After reading paragraph 1.d. above, I understand the \ninterpretation as provided, and unfortunately, my interpretation of the \nquestioning by the investigator was different from the intended meaning of \nthe questioning, and not \u201cintentionally omitting relevant facts.\u201d (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant believes that his more than 20 years \u201cof impeccably protecting and \nserving our nation and government as a contractor employee speaks volumes towards \n[his] reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified and sensitive information.\u201d  \nHe asserted, without any corroborating documentation, that every government civilian \nand colleague with whom he has worked on programs for AGA \u201ccan and would attest to \n[his] level of trustworthiness, integrity and ability to know right from wrong.\u201d He also \nasserted that everyone would attest to him being \u201can honest and forthright person with a \nhigh level of integrity and trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant denied that the incidents in the SOR \ncould be a source of coercion, because his wife is aware \u201cof the incident\u201d and there is no \none that could learn of his \u201cpast indiscretions\u201d that would cause him to reveal information \nhe has promised to protect. (Item 4.) Applicant\u2019s work records apparently show that he \nhas had annual reviews with his current employer and that he received the highest \npossible remarks in each review, performing above and beyond his employer\u2019s \nexpectations. (Item 13.) \n \n \nWith his Answer, Applicant submitted the report of the psychosexual risk \nassessment completed in early July 2018. According to the evaluating clinician, a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW), Applicant disclosed that he \u201cimpulsively\u201d had his daughter \ntouch his penis when she was between two and four months old, and that he felt \u201cterrible \nand confused\u201d and had no idea why he \u201cdid such a thing to [his] daughter.\u201d Applicant \nadvised the LCSW that he had suppressed the incident and did not intend to ever reveal \nit to anyone. He denied having any other urge or desire to engage his daughter or any \nother child sexually. The LCSW found nothing in Applicant\u2019s life that would trigger the \nconduct; \u201cno evidence of Pedophilia (an enduring sexual attraction to prepubescents) or \nany other mental health disorders that could cause him to act out sexually;\u201d and no pattern \nof sexual conduct suggesting that Applicant would be likely to seek out sex with children. \nApplicant reported to the LCSW that he felt \u201cdistressed and disgusted with himself for \ncommitting the offense and hiding it from his wife and family.\u201d In the opinion of the LCSW, \nApplicant expressed remorse and an adequate level of empathy for his daughter and \nothers hurt by his behavior. He found Applicant to be honest about his sexual misconduct. \n\n9 \n \nNoting that Applicant was not at a stressful stage in his life and that there was no evidence \nthat Applicant acted out sexually prior to or after the incident involving his daughter, the \nLCSW concluded that the sexual conduct was an aberration and not indicative of a sexual \ndisorder or preferential interest in children. The LCSW found no current mental health \nconcerns and gave Applicant an excellent prognosis. (Item 4.) In reviewing the LCSW\u2019s \nreport, I note there is nothing that indicates that Applicant made the clinician aware of his \nonline searches to view nude teens or his attempt to lure his teenage neighbor for sexual \ncontact. \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government notified Applicant of its ongoing concern about his \n\u201cgross lack of judgment on various occasions,\u201d which was viewed so seriously as to be \nnot mitigated by the passage of time; that the behaviors make him vulnerable to \nexploitation or coercion; and that his vulnerability is \u201chighlighted\u201d by his dishonesty about \nthe facts surrounding his sexual behaviors. The Government noted that Applicant claimed \nduring his polygraph with AGA that his daughter had only touched his penis with her hand \nin 2005 and had not disclosed that he had pulled his infant daughter\u2019s head to position \nher mouth on his penis with the intention of having her suck it. Applicant was also informed \nin the FORM of the Government\u2019s concerns that he may not have been forthcoming during \nhis psychosexual risk assessment in July 2018 in that nothing was said about Applicant \nhaving placed his daughter\u2019s mouth on his penis, about the incident involving his teenage \nneighbor, or about his online searches for naked teens. The Government also noted that \nit is unclear to what extent his spouse is aware of the details of the incident involving their \ndaughter or of the other sexual behaviors. (FORM.) Applicant apparently chose not to \nrespond to the FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n10 \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigations or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nApplicant exercised extremely poor judgment within the context of Guideline E in \nseveral aspects. He conducted online searches to view images of nude female minors \nbetween 2002 and 2003. In late 2005, when his daughter was only an infant, he pulled \nhis daughter\u2019s head to his semi-erect and exposed penis, causing her lips to come in \ncontact with his penis with the intention of having her suck it. His sexual contact was not \nonly inappropriate and a betrayal of trust, it was criminal in nature. In approximately 2006, \nhe attempted to lure a teenage neighbor to his basement with a plan to kiss her, and if \nshe consented, fondle her. The security concerns are no less serious because his plan \nwas thwarted by the teen, who exercised sound judgment and showed his wife the text in \nwhich he asked the teen to come to his basement. He attributes the incident to alcohol \n\n11 \n \nand asserts that he would not likely have allowed the sexual contact to proceed to \nintercourse with the teen because of his morals. However, alcohol does not adequately \nexplain his disturbing sexual behavior. \n \n \nGuideline E security concerns were also alleged because, during his polygraph \ninterview conducted on June 18, 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), Applicant disclosed that he had \nexposed his penis to his infant daughter, but claimed that she had grabbed at his penis \nor he may have placed her hand there, causing his penis to become erect. He denied to \nthe AGA polygraph examiner that he had engaged in any other inappropriate contact with \nhis daughter. Applicant asserts that he did not purposely withhold any details from the \npolygraph examiner, explaining that he misinterpreted the question as whether there were \nother incidents involving his daughter beyond the incident disclosed. In analyzing an \napplicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s answers in light \nof the evidence as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017); \nISCR Case No. 10-04821 App. Bd. May 21, 2012). I have considered Applicant\u2019s denial \nof any intentional misrepresentation or omission, but found his explanation not credible in \nlight of other evidence. Most notably, his June 19, 2018 account of the incident with his \ndaughter differs significantly from that provided during the polygraph interview. He \nadmitted during AGA\u2019s investigation that he had pulled his daughter\u2019s head toward him \nand pushed her lips to his penis, causing his penis to become erect. He also admitted \nthat he had not been completely forthright during the polygraph because he did not want \nthe female polygraph examiner to know the details. Moreover, although not specifically \nalleged, he had not disclosed to the polygraph examiner on June 18, 2018, his efforts to \nview child pornography online, or his attempt to lure his teen neighbor for sexual contact. \n \n \nGuideline E notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n\n12 \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) applies because Applicant misrepresented details of his sexual \nmisconduct with his daughter when he was interviewed by AGA\u2019s polygraph examiner. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies in both aspects. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior is personal conduct, \nwhich if known, could reasonably affect his personal, professional, or community \nstanding, and he concealed relevant and material facts of his behavior. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his personal \nconduct raised by his sexual behavior and lack of candor. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17. One or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) warrants some consideration, given Applicant was the sole source of \nthe information concerning his sexual contact with his daughter, and he admitted during \nAGA\u2019s investigation following his polygraph that he had caused the sexual contact with \nhis daughter. However, the mitigating impact of AG \u00b6 17(a) is undermined by his present \ndenial of any intentional misrepresentation and other evidence casting doubt on his \nrepresentations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies in that \u201cso much time has passed\u201d since he conducted online \nsearches for, and likely viewed, teen nudity between 2002 and 2003; since he had \ninappropriate sexual contact with his then-infant daughter in late 2005; and since he \nattempted to lure his then 15 or 16-year-old neighbor for sexual contact in approximately \n2006. However, his misrepresentations or obfuscations during his June 18, 2018 pre-\npolygraph interview, which occurred when he had SCI access eligibility and a Top Secret \nclearance, are neither so minor nor so distant in time to qualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n17(c). Moreover, it appears that Applicant was not completely forthright with the LCSW \n\n13 \n \nwho evaluated him for psychosexual tendencies in July 2018. There is nothing in the \nLCSW\u2019s report that indicates Applicant advised him about his online searches for \npornographic images of minor females or about his attempt to lure a teenage neighbor to \nhis basement for kissing and possible fondling. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is likewise only partially established. Applicant acknowledged the \ninappropriate sexual behavior. He attributes his online searches for naked images of \nunderage females to his immaturity, and the incident involving the teenage neighbor to \nbeing under the influence alcohol at the time. He has been unable or unwilling to explain \nhis sexual contact with his infant daughter. In Applicant\u2019s favor, there is no evidence of \nany recurrence of the sexual misconduct in over a decade. Applicant admitted to AGA \nduring its June 2018 investigation that he now prefers lesbian pornography. He provided \nno details as to the extent of his viewing of adult pornography, but it is not illegal conduct. \nHe has a positive prognosis from the LCSW, who believes Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct \nwas an aberration and not an indication of a sexual disorder or preferential interest in \nchildren. This positive assessment must be viewed in light of the possibility that the LCSW \ndid not know about Applicant\u2019s other conduct of a sexual nature, and Applicant\u2019s \nminimization of his incident with his daughter to the LCSW where he claimed he \n\u201cimpulsively\u201d took out his penis and helped his daughter touch it. The LCSW\u2019s evaluation \ndoes not mention Applicant\u2019s online searches for pornographic images of underage teens \nor of his attempt to lure his teenage neighbor for sexual contact.  \n \n \nApplicant has yet to convincingly establish that his representations can be \nreasonably relied on. As a longtime security clearance holder, he had an obligation to \nrespond to lawful questions of investigators, and he declined to discuss the incidents of \nsexual misconduct during his first OPM interview. He told AGA during its June 2018 \ninvestigation that he no longer attempts to view pornography of teenage girls as he prefers \nviewing adult lesbian pornography. Yet, when he answered the SOR in August 2019, he \nstated, \u201cSince this time period [2002 and 2003], I have not searched for this type, nor any \ntype of pornography,\u201d which is seemingly inconsistent with what he told AGA. As \npreviously discussed, there is no indication that he told the LCSW in July 2018 about his \nonline searches for pornographic images of teens or about his attempt to lure a teen for \nsexual contact. He undermines his credibility by claiming that he misinterpreted the \nquestion of the polygraph examiner about his sexual contact with his daughter. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated under either AG \u00b6 17(c) or AG \n\u00b6 17(d). \n \n \nVulnerability issues raised by his sexual behavior are only minimally mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 17(e). Given Social Services\u2019 investigation into his conduct in the summer of \n2018, Applicant was \u201cforced\u201d into telling his spouse about the incident involving their \ndaughter. However, as aptly noted in the Government\u2019s FORM, it is not clear to what \nextent his spouse is aware of the details of his conduct involving their daughter. He \nrevealed during AGA\u2019s investigation in June 2018 that he no longer attempts to view \npornography of teenage girls and now prefers viewing adult lesbian pornography. There \nis no evidence that his spouse (or his children for that matter) knows of his interest in \nlesbian pornography. Applicant admitted to an OPM investigator in February 2019 that \n\n14 \n \nhis spouse was unaware of his online searches for pornographic images of underage \nteens. He also stated that his neighbors lack knowledge and that their friendship would \nprobably be altered if it became known. Applicant claims that all those persons who have \na need to know are aware, but he did not elaborate about who these persons are or what \nthey know. He provided no letters from his spouse, children, co-workers, friends, or \nneighbors that could have alleviated vulnerability concerns. Applicant asserted in \nresponse to the SOR that \u201cthere is no one in this world that could learn of [his] past \nindiscretions\u201d that would cause him to reveal information he has promised to protect. The \nGovernment is not required to wait to see what Applicant would do before taking actions \nto protect national security. For the reasons noted, the personal conduct security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is articulated in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified for sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. . . . \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Internet searches to view pornographic images of teens between 2002 \nand 2003 on 10 to 15 occasions and his sexual contact with his then-infant daughter in \nlate 2005 are criminal in nature. Applicant had criminal intent when he attempted to lure \nhis teenage neighbor to his basement in approximately 2006. Applicant exhibited a \nserious lack of judgment in each instance, and as discussed under Guideline E, his sexual \nbehavior is conduct that could make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) apply. \n \n \nSexual behavior security concerns may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 14. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n\n15 \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or received a favorable \nprognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the \nbehavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 14(b), it cannot be reasonably ignored that the conduct happened \nso long ago. AG \u00b6 14(d) has no applicability to his sexual conduct, which could have been \ncriminally prosecuted had it become known at the time. Regarding AG \u00b6 14(e), Applicant \nhas not completed any treatment for his sexual behaviors. He has a favorable prognosis \nfrom a LCSW, who opined in July 2018 that Applicant did not exhibit a sexual disorder or \na preferential interest in children and did not need formal sexual offender treatment or \nmental health intervention. The passage of time without any evidence of recurrence of \nthe sexual behavior provides support for this clinical assessment. However, as previously \ndiscussed, that assessment is undermined by the LCSW\u2019s apparent lack of knowledge \nabout Applicant\u2019s involvement in child pornography and attempt to lure his 15 or 16-year-\nold neighbor to his basement for sexual contact. Despite the passage of time, the risk of \nvulnerability to coercion or pressure cannot be ruled out, and his sexual behavior remains \nof concern on that basis. Applicant has yet to tell his spouse about his interest in viewing \npornography. It is unclear what she, or others know, about his sexual behavior. Concerns \nabout the reliability of his representations make it difficult to accept without corroboration \nhis assertions that those who have a need to know are aware of his sexual behaviors and \nthat he cannot be coerced or pressured. Unmitigated vulnerability concerns exist \nirrespective of whether the sexual behaviors reoccur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n16 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline D, Guideline \nE, and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts that \u201canyone [he has] ever come in contact with would attest to \n[him] being an honest and forthright person with a high level of integrity and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d His uncorroborated assertion is not enough to overcome the serious \nconcerns for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness raised by his criminal sexual \nbehavior committed on his daughter, who fortunately was too young to understand or be \naffected by his behavior; by the fact that he kept his misconduct secret for so many years; \nand by his recent lack of complete candor during government investigations. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n17 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions to two of the three SOR allegations, Applicant\u2019s testimony and that of her witness at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant, 60, has worked as a software engineer for a major U.S. Government contractor since 2003. She has held a security clearance since at least 2008. She was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. In addition, she has earned two professional certifications in her field. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2003. She has no children. She has owned her present home since at least 2011. (Tr. at 39, 40, 42.) In her SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had not filed her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years (TY) 2012 through 2016. In her September 2018 background interview, she stated that she had filed for an extension to file her TY 2017 tax returns that expired in October 2018. In her SOR answer, she admitted that she still had not filed her 2012 through 2016 federal and state tax returns and that she had not filed her 2017 returns. At the hearing, she testified that these returns remained unfiled and that she had also not filed her TY 2018 federal and state tax returns. Since her failure to file her 2018 returns was not alle",

Myers, Esq. \nFebruary 26, 2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant failed to file her federal personal income tax returns for the \nyears 2012 through 2017, and failed to provide satisfactory evidence to show that she \nhad filed her state tax returns for the same period. Applicant\u2019s evidence was insufficient \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by her six-year pattern of not filing her tax returns. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 11, 2018, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 31, 2019, setting forth three allegations under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \n\n2 \n \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective for all \nadjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 28, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR. She requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn October 31, 2019, the case was initially assigned to another administrative judge, and \nwas reassigned to me on November 26, 2019. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 19, 2019, scheduling the hearing on January 9, 2020.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented three \nproposed exhibits. I marked her exhibits as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and I \nmarked her exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant testified, called one additional \nwitness, and offered no documentary evidence at the hearing, but requested additional \ntime to submit proposed exhibits after the hearing. I granted her request and gave her a \ndeadline of February 14, 2020. On February 10, 2020, her attorney\u2019s office emailed seven \nproposed exhibits to DOHA, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G. I \nmarked that email as Hearing Exhibit II. Absent any objections, I admitted all exhibits into \nthe record. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 21, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions to two of the three SOR allegations, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and that of her witness at the hearing, and the documentary \nevidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 60, has worked as a software engineer for a major U.S. Government \ncontractor since 2003. She has held a security clearance since at least 2008. She was \nawarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a master\u2019s degree in 2008. In addition, she has \nearned two professional certifications in her field. She married in 1987 and divorced in \n2003. She has no children. She has owned her present home since at least 2011. (Tr. at \n39, 40, 42.) \n \n \nIn her SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had not filed her federal and state income \ntax returns for the tax years (TY) 2012 through 2016. In her September 2018 background \ninterview, she stated that she had filed for an extension to file her TY 2017 tax returns \nthat expired in October 2018. In her SOR answer, she admitted that she still had not filed \nher 2012 through 2016 federal and state tax returns and that she had not filed her 2017 \nreturns. At the hearing, she testified that these returns remained unfiled and that she had \nalso not filed her TY 2018 federal and state tax returns. Since her failure to file her 2018 \nreturns was not alleged in the SOR, this fact will only be used to determine mitigation. \n(GE 2 at 2; Tr. at 52, 57-58.) \n \n \nApplicant claims that she did not file her federal and state personal income tax \nreturns for TY 2012 through 2015 because her 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns were \n\n3 \n \nunder audit by the IRS. The IRS examined certain tax deductions taken by Applicant in \nthose returns. She testified that she felt strongly that her deductions were proper. The \nIRS disagreed in part and the audits were concluded in January 2016. The IRS advised \nher in a letter what deductions were permissible and what were not. She was also advised \nthat she would be subjected to penalties for failing to file her returns on time. (Tr. at 47-\n51, 60-63.) \n \n \nAs noted, the IRS disallowed some of Applicant\u2019s contested tax deductions in 2010 \nand 2011. She claimed that she has paid the taxes due for 2010. Applicant Exhibit A, \nhowever, reflects that she has an outstanding balance of about $2,000. The exhibit also \nnotes that the balance is \u201ccurrently not collectable.\u201d She admitted that she owed about \n$16,000 for 2011. She claims she is paying that debt, but AE B reflects that her last \npayment on her TY 2012 taxes was made in April 2016. AE B also states that as of March \n2019, this tax debt is \u201ccurrently not collectable.\u201d (AE A at 2; AE B at 4; Tr. at 47-52.) \n \n \nSince the completion of the audits for TY 2010 and 2011 in 2016, Applicant has \nnot filed her returns for TY 2012 through 2015, nor has she filed her more recent returns. \nShe claims that she had extenuating circumstances that prevented her from filing. Her \n2012 tax returns were not filed on time because the mortgage lender on her home was \nseeking to foreclose on the property. In 2013, she was successful in obtaining a \nmodification of the mortgage loan. At that point, she was involved in a contentious dispute \nwith the IRS over her tax deductions. She refused to file any further returns until the issue \nwas resolved because she knew she would be claiming the same deductions in her \nreturns for the years after 2011. (Tr. at 45-48.) \n \n \nApplicant had a number of other excuses for her delay after the completion of the \naudit. The main one was that she learned in 2016 that she had mold in her house. She \nbegan to experience health issues due to the mold. She was on disability for four months \nat the end of 2016. More mold was discovered in 2017. She was also busy traveling to \nEurope for work. On one occasion her roof leaked and caused additional mold problems. \nOn another occasion, her garage was flooded causing more mold. She kept her tax \npaperwork in the garage. She was frequently displaced from her house while contractors \nrepaired the recurring mold damage. At the time of the hearing, she had been living in a \nhotel for most of 2019. (Tr. at 37-38, 52-58.) \n \n \nApplicant hired a tax advisor a week or two before the hearing. The advisor testified \nthat the returns would be filed by February 6, 2020, because that was the deadline \nimposed by the IRS. She had contacted the IRS and was told that the IRS did not require \nApplicant to file returns for TY 2012 and 2013. Applicant testified that her home \ncontractors are helping her by removing boxes of financial records from her residence so \nthat she can turn the records over to her tax advisor. After the hearing, no evidence was \nprovided that the delinquent federal tax returns were filed. Also, no reason was given to \nexplain the lack of such evidence. (Tr. at 16-17, 57-58.) \n \n \nAfter the hearing, the office of Applicant\u2019s counsel provided the first page of state \ntax returns for TY 2014 through 2017. The exhibits only reflect Applicant\u2019s identifying \n\n4 \n \ninformation, filing status, and single personal exemption. There is no indication that these \nreturns have been completed, signed, and filed or whether she owes any state taxes. \nThere is also no accompanying representation from Applicant, her tax advisor, or her \nattorney that these returns have been filed. Furthermore, there is no explanation for the \nomission of state tax returns TY 2012 and 2013, the first two years alleged in the SOR. \nThe record is similarly silent as to whether Applicant filed her 2018 state tax returns. \nApplicant Exhibit C, however, is a letter from her state tax authorities. It reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s state taxes for TY 2014 were fully paid in 2018. (AE C-G.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n\n5 \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline potentially apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d),  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . as required.\u201d)  \n \n\n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) are established by Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions, testimony, \nand the documentary evidence in the record. Applicant failed to meet her financial \nobligation to file her tax returns. However, AG \u00b6 19(a) is not established because there is \nno SOR allegation that Applicant had a tax debt or that she was unable to satisfy it. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal and state tax returns for TY 2012 \nthrough 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that the IRS had selected for audit Applicant\u2019s federal \nincome tax returns for TY 2010 and 2011. This subparagraph also alleges that as of the \ndate of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s taxes for those years \u201cremain unresolved.\u201d The evidence \nestablished that the audits were resolved by 2016. Department Counsel moved to delete \nthe second sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.c regarding the absence of a resolution of the audits. \n(Tr. at 72.) I grant that request.  \n \nThe fact that the IRS audited two years of Applicant\u2019s tax returns is not \ndisqualifying. The SOR does not allege that Applicant owes any taxes for either TY 2010 \nor 2011. Department Counsel declined to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence at \nthe hearing that Applicant had an outstanding federal tax debt for TY 2011. She elected \ninstead to leave the unpaid 2011 tax debt for consideration as part of the entirety of the \nrecord evidence. (Tr. at 72-73.) \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nThe facts established by the record evidence demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s tax filing \ndelinquencies are recent, frequent, and did not occur under any unusual circumstances. \n\n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file her tax returns was due to her refusal to comply with her filing \nrequirement, and her desire to prove that the IRS was wrong in not allowing all of her tax \ndeductions. After the audits were concluded in 2016, Applicant blames her failure to file \nher past and ongoing returns on various excuses, none of which persuade me that the \ncircumstances she experienced in the more recent years were the actual cause of her \nfailure to file her state and federal tax returns. The current state of the record is that she \nstill has not filed her federal tax returns, and has not convincingly established that she \nhas filed her state tax returns, for the limited period of TY 2014 through 2017. Applicant\u2019s \nactions cast doubts about her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Moreover, \nshe has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not \nestablished.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Days before the hearing, Applicant hired a tax \nprofessional to assist her in preparing her delinquent tax returns. The absence of \nevidence that Applicant has filed her 2014 to 2017 federal tax returns by the deadline \nimposed by the IRS suggests that the tax advisor was unsuccessful in meeting the \ndeadline or the last date for the submission of additional evidence in this proceeding. With \nrespect to the partial state tax returns in the record, I conclude that the evidence is \ninconclusive that these returns were fully prepared, signed, and filed. I note that I received \nno requests from Applicant for additional time to make an additional submission. Given \nthe state of the record, there are no clear indications that Applicant\u2019s tax filing \ndelinquencies are under control or are being resolved.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is inapplicable because the SOR contains no allegation regarding any \ndebts owed by Applicant.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant \nhas filed any tax returns for the years in question. As noted above, I reject Applicant\u2019s \nscant evidence regarding her state tax returns as persuasive evidence that any state \nreturns have been completed, signed, and filed. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all of the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her tax filing delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He mitigated the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. He denies the risk of recurrence of providing money \nfor intimacy, but concerns persist about his personal conduct. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n   \n \n2 \n \n \nOn August 24, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On December 12, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on January 16, 2020. \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the evidence presentation, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR to conform with the evidence admitted, under under \u00b6 E3.1.17of the \nDirective, to which Applicant had no objection. (Tr. 80) The SOR was amended to read: \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E \u2013 Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAvailable information raising this concern shows that:  \n \na. In the late 1990s and again from 2012 through at least 2019, you paid \nvarious women specifically for sexual acts and services. (Tr. 80)  \n \nFour Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 4) and nine Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 I) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the hearing \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On March 9, 2020, four documents \nwere received and admitted into evidence without objection as Ex. J \u2013 M. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on January 29, 2020. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old software engineer who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2014 when he changed from being a contractor for the company \nto being a full-time permanent employee.

A, Tr. 70) \n \nApplicant took his credit card accounts to unsafe levels, cashed out his 401(k) \nretirement plan of approximately $300,000, and sold investments worth $83,242 to \nprovide money to women he met at gentlemen\u2019s clubs. (Tr. 14, Tr. 30, Ex. K and L) He \nacknowledged his poor judgment for these actions. (Tr. 14) Applicant owed $112,280 in \nfederal income taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Ex. 2)  \n \nThere are no credit card accounts currently of concern. On Applicant\u2019s May 2017 \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he stated he had paid off two credit \n\n   \n \n3 \n \n \ncard accounts and two credit union accounts totaling $70,637. (Ex. 1) He asserted he had \nentered into a debt-relief program to successfully pay off all of his accounts. (Ex. 1) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2017 and March 2019 credit reports indicate Applicant has no past due \naccounts. (Ex. 3, 4)  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2017 e-QIP, he indicated he had not filed or paid his federal \nincome taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Ex. 1) He stated: \n \nI filed my 2014 taxes as required, requesting and receiving an extension. At \nthe due date of my extension I made a payment of less that the complete \namount due as, after cashing out my 401k, I ended up not having the funds \nto pay the additional taxes due to early withdrawal penalties. Note: the 401k \nfunds were withdrawn largely as a result of my having been laid off in \nFebruary of 2014 and I wanted to pay off existing credit card debt. I was not \ncontacted to pay the remainder of the 2014 taxes and, after hiring [tax firm] \nto assist in reaching a settlement with both the 2015 and 2014 taxes, \ndiscovered there had been an identity theft and the IRS had no record of \nmy filing. Thankfully, the record of payments, insufficient though they were, \nwas found. \n \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s e-QIP he stated about tax year 2015, \u201cI had insufficient funds to \npay the balanced owed at the conclusion of my extension. The amount owed was higher \nthan expected due to the money saved by my credit card settlements being charged as \nincome.\u201d (Ex. 1) He listing owing federal income taxes of $36,385 for tax year 2015 and \nestimated he owed $50,000 for tax year 2014.

(Ex. I) The June 2019 \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \ninstallment agreement with the IRS lists $60,487 owed for tax year 2014, and $112,280 \nin total federal income taxes due for tax years 2014 through tax year 2016. (Ex. 2) \n**** The $1,329 tax refund for tax year 2018 was applied to Applicant\u2019s tax balance for \ntax year 2015. (Ex. I) \nOn July 5, 2019, Applicant completed his responses to written interrogatories in \nwhich he stated he had a tax preparer file an extension for his 2014 federal income tax \nreturn (Ex. 2, Tr. 52) Applicant believed his tax preparer would file his return within the \nextended deadline. His tax preparer never contacted him again to inform him how much \nwas owed for tax year 2014. (Tr. 53) The 2014 federal income tax return was not filed \nuntil 2017. (Tr. 33) Applicant did not file his 2015 tax return until December 2016. (Ex. 2, \nTr.55) He lives in a state that does not have a state income tax obligation. \n \nOn November 2018, Applicant made an unsworn declaration during an enhanced \nsubject interview. (Ex. 2) He stated he had hired a tax firm to help him address his past-\ndue federal taxes. (Tr. 20) The firm was attempting to negotiate a reduction of his tax \nburden. (Tr. 62) There was to be a hearing with the IRS at which the tax firm was to \nrepresent his interests before the IRS. (Tr. 62) In March 2017, Applicant made an initial \npayment of $6,000 to a tax firm to help him with his federal taxes. (Ex. D) He then started \nmaking $600 monthly payments to the firm. Between March 2017 and January 2020, he \npaid the tax firm $25,200 for assistance in obtaining a reduction of this federal tax \ndelinquency. (Ex. D, J) As of March 2020, the attempt was unsuccessful, and he ended \nthe $600 monthly payment to the tax firm. (Ex. J) \n \nApplicant had entered into an installment agreement with the IRS and paid $10,000 \non April 15, 2015, on his 2014 federal income tax obligation. On October 20, 2015, he \nmade a payment of $100 on his 2014 tax obligation. (Ex. F) In 2016, he made two \nadditional payments totaling $121 to address his 2015 federal tax obligation. (Ex. F) In \nMay 2019, entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS agreeing to make monthly \npayments of $1,387 to repay past-due taxes with his first payment due June 28, 2019. \n(Ex. 2, Tr. 20) His monthly installment payments to the IRS remain timely and \nuninterrupted. (Ex. J., Tr. 60) Between March 16, 2016, and February 24, 2019, he made \n11 payments totaling $13,696 to the IRS toward his 2014, 2015, and 2017 tax year taxes. \n(Ex. F, M) \n \n \nIn 1997-1998, Applicant provided $6,000 to a woman not further identified in the \nrecord. In 2000, he provided $60,000 to another woman SA. (Tr. 38) Those funds were \nnot repaid. (Tr. 39) He had a sexual relationship with SA, but he asserts the money \nprovided was not payment for a sexual relationship or sexual conduct. (Tr. 43) He denied \nhaving had sexual intercourse with the other woman, but had \u201cintimate relations,\u201d which \nwere not further explained in the record. (Tr. 43) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s November 2018 subject interview, he was questioned about \n$28,725 in payments he had made to three women. He acknowledges he used poor \njudgment in providing money to women (AB, LW, and JS) that he met in gentlemen\u2019s \n\n   \n \n5 \n \n \nclubs. (Ex. 2, Tr. 36) He started lending money to these individuals starting in 2010. (Tr. \n35) When he provided the money, he believed AB would not repay the money he gave \nher. He believed LW and JS would repay him. (Ex. 2) He stated he provided money to \nLW to help her with her Lupus treatment including nursing care and medical costs. As of \nNovember 2018, he was still providing monies to help LW with her medical expenses. \n(Ex. 2) He was intimate with some, but not all of the women that he provided with money. \n(Tr. 40)  \n \n \nApplicant met LW at a gentleman\u2019s club, where she was a dancer. (Tr. 36) On June \n14, 2012, a loan agreement was written between Applicant and LW. (Ex. C) However, the \nagreement was never signed not notarized by LW. The loan document listed the collateral \nprovided and the 16.99% interest rate, but did not list the amount of the loan or the \npurpose of the loan. (Ex. C) The loan agreement gave Applicant the assurance and belief \nthat the money provided would ultimately be repaid. (Tr. 15) He had known LW for two \nyears at the time the contract was written and in 2012, they lived together for \napproximately four months. (Tr. 23) In total, he provided her with $350,000. (Tr. 24) He \nbelieves he will be repaid the funds in May or June 2020. (Tr. 25) She anticipated \nreceiving funds from an automobile accident. (Tr. 25) Applicant still maintains contact with \nLW. He had received a text message from LW the day of the hearing. (Tr. 43)  \n \nApplicant met JS at the same gentleman\u2019s club where she was and LW were \nbother dancers. (Tr. 36) He stopped going to gentleman\u2019s clubs in 2012, because he had \nno more money. (Tr. 46) He knew JS approximately three years and he provided her \nmoney over a course of time. (Tr. 27) He provided her approximately $177,000, believing \nthe money would be repaid from an insurance payoff she was expecting. (Tr. 29) The \nmoney he gave JS was used by her for child care and living expenses. (Tr. 29) He last \nsaw JS six to eight months ago. (Tr. 29) He now believes the funds will not be repaid and \nthat if she received an insurance payout, the money has been spent. (Tr. 30) He also \nprovided JS\u2019s sister $64,000. (Tr. 33) \n \n \nApplicant knew AB approximately three years when he loaned her money. (Tr. 27) \nAB worked as a waitress at the same gentleman\u2019s club, where JS and MW were dancers. \n(Tr. 36) Applicant and AB were friends and he provided her approximately $10,000 over \na period of time, believing the money would not be repaid. (Tr. 27, 47) The money was \nprovided in a number of transactions with her using the money for child care, medical \nexpenses, and living expenses. (Tr. 27-28) He last saw her eight months ago. (Tr. 28) \n \nApplicant asserts he has known the woman he provided the money to for more \nthan ten years. Over that period he had intimacy with them less than ten times. (Ex. J) \nThe most recent contact he had with any of the individuals was in June 2019. (Ex. J)  \n \nThree of the women: ML, AB, and JS performed sexual acts on Applicant after \nwhich he provided them with money. (Tr. 40) However, he initially asserted the money \nprovided was not payment for sexual acts. (Tr. 41) He then stated the money was for the \nintimate acts but not for sexual intercourse. (Tr. 41) He acknowledged the women would \ncome to his location, a sexual act (not intercourse) would take place, money was \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \nexchanged, and the women would leave. (Tr. 42) He then agreed the money was for \nsexual services. (Tr. 43) He was last intimate with ML in 2014, with AB two years ago, \nand with JS six months ago. (Tr. 45, 47, 48, 82) During 2018 and 2019, Applicant provided \nno money to any women other than ML. (Tr. 81) During that time period, he gave ML $200 \non one occasion and $500 on another. (Tr. 82) During those two years, he had less than \nten contact with the women. (Tr. 83)  \n \n \nApplicant stated he provided the financial assistance expecting in good faith to be \npaid back. Three of the individuals were waiting for legal settlements to receive delinquent \nchild support payments, funds from being injured in an automobile accident, and \nsettlement on the death of a spouse. (Tr. 20) He asserted about his financial issues,  \n \nThe needs of my friends, couple with their delayed repayments, forced me \nto use credit cards to an unsafe level. The increased credit card usage and \naccompanying bills resulted in my borrowing against my 401(k) and selling \nmy investments. (Tr. 20) \n \n \nAfter Applicant was laid off from his job in March 2014, he thought liquidating his \n401(k) retirement fund was a reasonable course of action. (Tr. 21) He feared the \nimpending loss of income when his severance pay expired, and with the assurance of \nimminent repayment of the funds provided his friends, he believed he could repay the \nfunds withdrawn from his 401(k). (Tr. 21) He had approximately $300,000 in his 401(k) at \nthe time he liquidated it. (Tr. 30) \n \n \nAs Applicant\u2019s severance pay was ending, he was rehired as a contractor by the \ncompany from which he had been laid off. However, his new pay when rehired was only \ntwo-thirds of his previous pay. (Tr. 21) With reduced income and high credit card bills, he \nentered into a high-interest loan in a credit card resettlement agreement in 2016. (Tr. 20, \n64) Through the credit relief service he consolidated his credit-card accounts and \nobtained a $31,000 personal loan with a 21% interest rate to address his credit-card \ndebts. (Tr. 66, 67) He says payment on the loan will continue for many more years. (Tr. \n20) His budget includes a monthly amount of $1,036 to a financial company. (Ex. H) The \ncompany lists itself as a financial network helping people overcome debt to achieve \nfinancial stability through their proven solutions for debt settlement, mortgage shopping, \nand personal loans. All services provided by the financial company ended with he \nobtained the loan. (Tr. 67) He no longer makes payment to the credit relief service, but \nstill makes timely monthly payments on the loan. (Tr. 66)  \nApplicant does not appear to be living above his means. His monthly income is \n$6,638, and his budget showed expenses of $6,073, which left $565 of disposable \nincome. (Ex. H) The budget as presented included monthly payments of $600 to the tax \nfirm, $1,387 to the IRS, and $1,036 to the debt relief program. (Ex. H) It also included an \nadditional $3,600 for utilities, insurance, rent, food, automobile payment, food, clothing, \nand credit card payment. (Ex. H) He drives a 2009 automobile. (Tr. 76) As previously \nstated he no longer makes the $600 monthly payments to the tax firm, which increases \nhis monthly disposable income to $1,165. \n\n   \n \n7 \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2014 and 2015 income tax returns in a timely manner \nand owed approximately $112,000 in federal income taxes for tax years 2014 through \n2016. AG \u00b6 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations;\u201d and (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nEven though a willful failure to timely file a completed federal income tax return is \na misdemeanor-level criminal offense under federal law, for the purposes of this decision, \nI am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2014 \nand 2015 against him as a federal crime. The failure to timely file federal tax returns has \nsecurity implications for the reasons noted by the Appeal Board:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \nFailing to timely file tax returns indicates an individual fails to demonstrate the \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified \ninformation. Even so, Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file returns for 2014 and 2015 was not \nalleged in the SOR, so it cannot be considered for disqualification purposes. However, \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax delinquency, which includes penalties for late filing or nonpayment, \nfor tax years 2014 and 2015 establishes the aforesaid disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant owed delinquent income taxes totaling approximately $112,000 for tax \nyears 2014 through 2016.  \n \nThe mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the behavior \ndid not happen long ago. Even though there were only two years of non-filing of returns \na concern remains because the full amount of the taxes have yet to be paid. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were partially caused \nby factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He was out of work for several months in 2014, but  \n\n   \n \n11 \n \n \nwhen his severance pay was ending, he decided to cash in his 401(k) account, cash in \nother investments, and use his credit cards unwisely. He was not victimized by predatory \nlending practices, but he was clearly victimized by women friends of his to whom he lent \nmoney anticipating some of it would be returned. The money was not returned.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a \nnon-profit credit counseling service. However, there are there are clear indications his tax \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does apply. He obtained a loan \nand addressed his credit card and credit union accounts. However, the cancellation of his \ncredit debt resulted in additional taxable income, which led to an increase in his tax \nliability. He has a high monthly payment on the loan, but he is current on the loan. He \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay those accounts or otherwise resolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply because Applicant is not disputing the legitimacy of any of his debts.  \n \nIn this instance AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all tax returns and \nhas reached a repayment agreement with the IRS for his delinquent taxes. His installment \npayments remain timely and uninterrupted since June 2019. The current balance of \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt is unknown. It is known that he has made more than $14,000 in \npayments to the IRS since June 2019. Not knowing the amount of interest being charged \nby the IRS, it is not possible to estimate the current balance owed. The period of payments \nis sufficient for me to believe he will continue making his required payments until the \nrepayment agreement is completed. With the application of AG \u00b6 20(g), under the \ncircumstances, he has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nApplicant provided money to a number of women and received acts of sexual \nintimacy from some of them. Not all of the more than $660,000 was provided for sexual \nintimacy. Some funds were provided to women he considered friends to help them with \ntheir medical, child care, and other living expenses. Some of the funds were provided with \nthe expectation of repayment when two of the women received reimbursement from \nlawsuits in which they were engaged. His extremely poor judgment establishes the \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 15, and support \u201ca whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \n\n   \n \n12 \n \n \ncomply with rules and regulations,\u201d as contemplated in disqualifying condition AG \n\u00b6\u00b616(d)and 16(e), which state: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) Engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a personal with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n\n   \n \n13 \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant showed that he could be \nvulnerable to exploitation or duress by others who might seek to exploit his empathy or \ndesire for personal intimacy. Although he maintains that there is no risk of recurrence of \npaying women for sexual intimacy, he has not had any counseling, and not enough time \nhas passed for me to conclude that the conduct will not recur. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant owed approximately $112,000 in federal tax delinquency for years 2014 \nthrough 2016. However, in May 2019, he entered into a repayment agreement with the \nIRS, and his payments remain timely and uninterrupted. He has repaid more than $14,000 \nin accord with the repayment agreement. Applicant says he has learned from the \nexperience and is resolved to continue with his payments. \n \n \nApplicant also asserts he has learned from the experience with providing money \nfor sexual intimacy. He used extremely poor judgment in providing money in exchange \n\n   \n \n14 \n \n \nfor sexual favors to several women. His conduct in this regard is recent, and there is little \nindication that the behavior is safely in the past, notwithstanding that his depleted finances \nwould make such large transfers of funds impossible in the near future. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for specific past \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, \nand other characteristics essential to protecting national security information. The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility \nto fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without \nregard to their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised \nenough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401(9th Cir. 1990). I have carefully applied the \nlaw, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. The issue is not simply whether all the \ndelinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) The security \nconcerns are not mitigated over the large sums of money he provided women for sexual \nintimacy. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations concerns, but failed to mitigate \nthe personal conduct concerns. His personal conduct security concerns lead me to \nconclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n \n15 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, due to collection, charged-off, \nand delinquent accounts. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 31, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \nOn June 27, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On December 11, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on January 15, 2020. \n \nFour Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 4) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 C) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the hearing \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On January 21, 2020, five \ndocuments were received and admitted into evidence without objection as Ex. D \u2013 H. On \nFebruary 5, 2020, an additional document was received and admitted into evidence \nwithout objection as Ex. I. Applicant and his second-line supervisor testified, as reflected \nin a transcript (Tr.) received on January 29, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied a $603 medical collection account \nand a $728 collection account. He admitted the two charged-off accounts for two \nrepossessed vehicles and the other charged-off, delinquent, and collection accounts \nlisted in the SOR. After a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old manufacturing supervisor who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since July 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 1, Tr. 16) From \nJuly 2008 through July 2014, he served honorably in the U.S. Air Force before separating \nas an airman first class (A1C) (E-4). (Ex. 1) The U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs \n(VA) rates Applicant\u2019s disability at 60 per-cent due to back issues, knee problems, \nmigraines, sleep apnea, irritable bowel syndrome, and hearing problems. (Tr. 57) His \ndisability pay is approximately $1,400 monthly. (Tr. 57) When hired at his current job, his \nstarting salary was approximately $57,000. (Tr. 26) His current base annual income is \napproximately $77,000 and, with overtime, is approximately $108,000. (Tr. 16, 54, 55)  \n \nPrior to leaving the Air Force, Applicant had received an offer for a position as an \nairfield operations manager. However, after leaving the Air Force, he discovered the \nposition had been filled by another. (SOR Response) Not having the anticipated job, he \nstruggled financially to adapt to civilian life. He decided to go to college. While going to \nschool, he had a job at a supermarket and then at a guitar store. He later obtained a \nposition as a motorcycle sales representative. During his first four years after leaving the \nAir Force, his credit suffered as did his finances generally.  \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant married. He and his spouse have four children ages \n2, 3, 6, and 10. (Tr. 11) He is current on his vehicle payments and on his $1,700 monthly \nhome mortgage payments, which he had purchased in August 2019 for $203,000. (SOR \nResponse, Tr. 41, 58) He has two credit cards that are in good standing. He no longer \nlives paycheck to paycheck and contributes eight percent of his salary to his company\u2019s \n401(k) retirement plan. (SOR Response) He is current on his $292 monthly payments for \nhis Department of Education student loan debt. (Ex. E) The student loan debt is not listed \n\n \n3 \nin the SOR as a debt of concern. He asserted that since gaining his current employment, \nhe has paid a number of debts not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 39)  \n \nIn August 2015, while Applicant was working for a motorcycle dealership, he \npurchased a motorcycle. Initially, he was making a good income selling motorcycles, but \nthis did not last. The owner of the dealership fired him when the owner found out Applicant \nwas seeking different employment. (Tr. 24) Unable to make his monthly payments, the \nmotorcycle was repossessed and resold, which left a $7,962 delinquency (SOR 1.b). (Ex. \n2) In September 2019, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $3,184 with monthly \npayments of $61.25 starting in September 2019. (Ex. A, Tr. 33, Tr. 43) Applicant accepted \nthe offer. Between September 2019 and January 2020, he made 15 payments totaling \n$918. (Ex. C, Ex. H) Applicant asserts the last payment of the settlement agreement is to \nbe made in August 2020. (Ex. A, Tr. 33) \n \nIn 2013, while Applicant was still on active duty, he purchased an automobile. (Ex. \n2, Tr. 29) In March 2016, he was unable to make his monthly payment, and the vehicle \nwas repossessed resulting in a $12,958 balance owed (SOR 1.a). (Ex. 2) Between the \nrepossession and September 2018, when he provided a subject interview, he contacted \nthe creditor a few times. (Ex. 2, Tr. 45) In January 2020, the automobile finance company \nagreed to accept $9,070 to settle the debt. (Ex. D) The finance company also agreed to \nnotify the credit bureaus to update the account to \u201cCharged off \u2013 settlement in full\u201d once \nthe account is paid. (Ex, D) \n \nIn 2014, Applicant, then age 24, was working part time at a guitar store while \nattending college full time when he opened a line of credit and purchased a guitar. (Ex. \n2, Tr. 34, SOR Response) He admits not handling his finances properly, and the account \nbecame delinquent. The debt was charged off in the amount of $997 (SOR 1.c). At the \ntime of the hearing, Applicant was attempting to determine who currently holds the debt. \n(Tr. 49) When he went to the guitar store\u2019s website seeking information on the debt, no \nrecord was disclosed. (Tr. 52) A January 2020 letter from the creditor states the account \nhas a zero balance. (Ex. I) \n \nWhen Applicant made his SOR Response, he denied owing a $728 account that \nwas placed for collection (SOR 1.e) However, during his September 2018 enhanced \nsubject interview, he did not dispute the debt. (Ex. 2) The debt is reportedly a cell phone \nbill with Verizon. A collection agency is attempting to collect the delinquent amount. In the \nspring of 2019, he contacted the collection agency\u2019s website in an attempt to verify the \ndebt and found no record of the account. (Tr. 36, 52, SOR Response) His February 2018 \ncredit report indicates the \u201caccount was disputed.\u201d (Ex. 4) The account no longer appears \non any of his three January 18, 2020 credit reports. (Ex. E \u2013 G) The credit reports list \nnumerous other accounts as being paid as agreed. (Ex. 3) \n \nIn 2015, Applicant had his appendix removed. (Tr. 36) He incurred a $603 medical \ndebt for anesthesia services (SOR 1.d). This debt is listed only as delinquent and not \nlisted as charged off or in collection. In April 2019, Applicant made a $100 payment to \naddress an emergency physicians\u2019 debt. (Ex. B) In May 2019, this debt was settled and \npaid leaving a zero balance. (Ex. I, SOR Response, Tr. 35) His surgery also resulted in a \n\n \n4 \n$1,692 medical account (SOR 1.f) that was placed for collection. Applicant contacted the \ncollection company to discuss settlement of the debt. (Tr. 37) The company was not \nwilling to negotiate a lower settlement and payment arrangements were discussed. (SOR \nResponse) He had previously believed this debt had been paid. (Tr. 54) His January 16, \n2020 credit report lists zero balances on two anesthesia accounts and a balance of $602 \non another anesthesia account. (Ex. F)  \n \nApplicant owed a $480 cell phone debt (SOR 1.g) that was placed for collection. \nIn June 2017, the debt was incurred when he changed mobile phone carriers. He paid \nthe debt in full after the collection agency was unwilling to reduce the amount of the debt. \n(Tr. 37) At the hearing, he asserted he would provide documentation showing payment \nhad been made. He owed a $219 power and light debt (SOR 1.h) that was placed for \ncollection. He entered into a \u201cpay to delete agreement.\u201d (Tr. 38) However, each time he \ncontacted the company, he was unable to reach anyone to resolve the debt. (SOR \nResponse) His February 2018 credit report indicates the \u201caccount was disputed.\u201d (Ex. 4) \nThe debt does not appear on his most recent credit reports. (Ex. D \u2013 G) \n \nIn July 2018, when Applicant started his current job, he wanted to get himself on a \nsolid financial footing. (Tr. 44) He applied his funds to making his car payments, paying \nhis rent, and providing for food. (Tr. 44) He currently maintains his budget through an \nExcel spreadsheet. (Tr. 55) He is current on his $533 monthly car payments and his \n$1,700 mortgage payments. (Tr. 77) He has $22,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. \n56) Applicant is not receiving calls or letters from creditors demanding payment. (Tr. 40) \nHe is current on his student loans, which total approximately $20,000. (Tr. 59) He intends \nto pay all of his debts. (Tr. 77) He has not had any financial counseling. (Tr. 61) He asserts \nhe has grown and matured since leaving the Air Force. (Tr. 76) He no longer thinks he \nhas the world figured out.  \n \nCharacter Statement \n \nApplicant\u2019s second-line supervisor, a multi-functional manufacturing manager, who \nhas mentored Applicant for more than a year and a half, states Applicant is a hard-\nworking, dedicated member of the team. He said Applicant\u2019s morals and ethics are above \nreproach. Applicant has a willingness to learn from his past mistakes, to change for the \nbetter, and see things through. (SOR Response) He has discussed with Applicant the \nApplicant\u2019s finances, including how to address his debts, and states Applicant is actively \nworking to pay down his debts. (Tr. 64, SOR Response)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n \n6 \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied two collection accounts totaling \n$1,331 and admitted the remaining delinquent obligations totaling approximately $30,000. \nThe debts resulting from two repossessed vehicles accounted for approximately $27,000 \nof the $30,000 amount. The record having established disqualifying conditions, additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has \nthe burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n\n \n7 \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \n \nApplicant paid the guitar account (SOR 1.c) and a cell phone service account (SOR \n1 g). He accepted a settlement agreement on his repossessed automobile that he had \npurchased in 2013 when he was on active duty. In January 2020, the automobile finance \ncompany agreed to accept $9,070 to settle the debt (SOR 1.a), which he accepted. He \nhas made numerous payments under a repayment agreement on the repossessed \nmotorcycle (SOR 1.b). Those payments are persuasive evidence that he will continue to \nmake payments until the debt has been paid in full. His track record of payments on that \nrepayment agreement gives me reason to believe he will also honor the repayment \nagreement on the repossessed automobile debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debts he has \npaid and the debts that he is resolving under established repayment agreements. \n \nApplicant disputes a $728 collection account (SOR 1.e). The debt arose as a cell \nphone bill. His February 2018 credit report indicates the \u201caccount was disputed.\u201d In the \nspring of 2019, he contacted the collection agency in an attempt to verify the debt and no \nrecord of the account was found. The account no longer appears on any of his three \nJanuary 18, 2020 credit reports. He also disputes a $219 delinquent electric utility debt \n(SOR 1.h). He had entered into a \u201cpay to delete agreement\u201d with the company. Each time \nhe contacted the company, he was unable to reach anyone that could resolve the debt. \nHis February 2018 credit report indicates the \u201caccount was disputed,\u201d and the debt does \nnot appear on his most recent credit reports. The evidence falls short of establishing \nApplicant\u2019s liability for those debts. \n \n \nThe remaining two debts, both medical debts, resulted when Applicant had his \nappendix removed in 2015. The $603 medical debt (SOR 1.d), for anesthesia services is \nlisted as delinquent, but not as charged off or in collection. In May 2019, this debt was \nsettled and paid leaving a zero balance. His surgery resulted in a second medical debt \n(SOR 1.f) that was placed for collection. He had previously believed this matter had been \npaid. He contacted the collection company to discuss settlement of the debt. However, \nthe company was not willing to negotiate a lower settlement and payment arrangements \nwere discussed. His January 16, 2020 credit report lists a zero balance on two anesthesia \naccounts and a balance of $602 on another anesthesia account.  \n\n \n8 \nWhile he was on active duty in the Air Force, he purchased a car that was later \nrepossessed. Prior to leaving the Air Force, he had received an offer for a position as an \nairfield operations manager, but discovered after his discharge that the position had been \nfilled by another after he had left the Air Force. This placed him in an unexpected position \nof being unemployed. He decided to go to college and worked while in school at a \nsupermarket and then at a guitar store. He later obtained a position as a motorcycle sales \nrepresentative. While working in these positions he purchased a guitar and a motorcycle. \nHis guitar debt has been paid; he is repaying the motorcycle debt; and he has a \nrepayment agreement on the repossessed car debt. He owes a little over $11,000 on the \nloans for the repossessed motorcycle and car, which accounts for 88 percent of the SOR \ndebt.  \n \nThe purchase of the car, motorcycle, and guitar all occurred while he was \nemployed. It was the loss of employment that contributed to his inability to repay the \ndebts. These purchases happened a while ago, there are only three, which indicates they \nare infrequent, and occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur. Having resolved the \nguitar debt and with repayment agreements on the vehicle loans, these debts do not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \napplies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment after the purchases was a condition beyond his \ncontrol. Additionally, the medical debts resulted from having his appendix removed, which \nis an unexpected medical emergency. He has acted responsibly to address the debts, \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n \nIn July 2017, when Applicant started his current job, he wanted to get himself on a \nsolid financial footing. In August 2019, his finances were sufficiently meritorious that he \nwas able to obtain a mortgage to purchase a $203,000 home. Routinely, mortgage \ncompanies do not approve mortgages unless they believe the borrower is a good financial \nrisk. He maintains a budget, is current on his mortgage payments, vehicle payments, \nutility bills, student loans, and is not receiving call or letters from creditors demanding \npayment. He has $22,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. He no longer lives paycheck to \npaycheck. Even though he has not had any formal financial counseling, there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved and is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is also established because Applicant has paid in full or settled some debts, \nand has taken significant steps toward addressing the delinquent vehicles loans that \naccount for most of the indebtedness of concern to the DoD.  \n \nApplicant disputes two small SOR debts (SOR 1.e and 1.h). When he contacted \nthe creditors, they could provide no information on the debts. He disputed them on his \ncredit reports, and they no longer appear on his current credit reports. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nto these two small debts. \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his \ndebts and that he has taken significant steps to implement his plan, which he has done. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n\n \n9 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable active duty service in the U.S. Air Force. \nHis military service resulted in disabilities rated by the VA at 60 per-cent due to back \nissues, knee problems, migraines, sleep apnea, irritable bowel syndrome, and hearing \nproblems. His military service merits respect and consideration. \n \nSupervisors\u2019 character evaluations are important and often more accurate \nbecause they have observed individuals over longer periods of time and under a variety \nof events and stresses. Supervisors are required to evaluate individuals and describe \ntheir performance, trustworthiness, reliability, and dedication. Applicant\u2019s second-line \nsupervisor has mentored Applicant for more than a year and a half. He states Applicant \nis a hard-working, dedicated member of the team whose morals and ethics are above \nreproach. Applicant has a willingness to learn from his past mistakes, to change for the \nbetter, and see things through. He has discussed Applicant\u2019s finances with him, including \nhow to address his debts, and states Applicant is actively working to pay down his debts. \nThese comments inspire confidence that Applicant will follow through on his repayment \nagreements and address his financial obligations.  \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \n\n \n10 \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on July 15, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n10, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 29, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE G through M and admitted \nwithout objection. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2011, but he moved to a different location in 2015. He seeks \nto retain a security clearance, which he has held since about 2011. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree that was awarded in 2011 and additional credits but no post-graduate degree. \nHe is single without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40-41, 43; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant asserted that his move to a different location for his job in 2015 was \nmore costly than he anticipated. His rent increased by $400 per month. His car was \nwrecked in an accident in 2015, and he had to buy a new car. With the added \nexpenses, he was unable to pay all his bills. A number of accounts became delinquent, \nand his student loans went into default. (Tr. at 17, 28-31; GE 2-4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four defaulted student loans totaling $91,624, with two of the \nloans reduced to judgments, and four miscellaneous delinquent debts with balances \ntotaling about $28,000. Applicant admitted owing all the debts, but he stated that he was \nmaking arrangements to pay them. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2018. He reported his four defaulted student loans as well as the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h, which he listed as being $1,345 and $2,132. Those figures \nreflected the past-due amounts, not the balances. He indicated that he planned to take \nout a loan from his 401(k) retirement plan to pay the majority of his student loans. He \nstated that he was working overtime and putting money aside, which he planned to use \nto pay the two delinquent debts the following month. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in June 2018. He \ndiscussed his financial problems. He stated that he planned to pay his delinquent debts \nand defaulted student loans. He indicated that he was considering using his 401(k) \nfunds to pay his debts. (GE 2) \n \n \nThe DOD obtained Applicant\u2019s credit report in April 2019. The report listed all of \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. The report listed the account for the past-due debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was opened in June 2018, and the last payment was made in \nOctober 2018. The most recent payment on the other delinquent debts and defaulted \nloans was made in May 2018. The credit report also listed that Applicant was $1,167 \npast due on his auto loan, and that he was past due a total of $174 on three other small \ndebts. He had to travel internationally after a family member passed away in a foreign \ncountry. He testified that he is still two months behind on the auto loan, but he is \nattempting to get caught up.1 (Tr. at 38-39; GE 4) \n \n                                                          \n1 The auto loan and the three small past-due debts were not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not \nalleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-\nperson analysis. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe same lender owns the four defaulted student loans. The lender obtained \njudgments against Applicant for at least two of the loans. His wages were garnished \n$8,447 in 2019 to satisfy the judgment for the $8,076 defaulted loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. He has not documented any payments toward the three other defaulted student \nloans. The lender may attempt to enforce the other judgment or judgments by \ngarnishment. Applicant testified that he owed $975 on the loan against his 401(k), and \nafter that loan is paid, he will take out another loan to pay his two smaller student loans \n($26,802 and $15,464). His pay statement for the one-week pay period ending \nDecember 20, 2019, indicated that $51 was deducted for his 401(k) loan, and that \n$2,686 had been deducted year-to-date. (Tr. at 17-22, 31-34, 39; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, G, K-M) \n \n \nThe bank that is owed the $7,295 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f sued Applicant for \npayment. In July 2019, the bank and Applicant entered into a stipulation for payment in \nfull. Applicant agreed to pay at least $200 a month until $7,295 plus $364 court costs is \npaid in full. He provided documentation that he made the four required $200 payments \nsince August 2019. (Tr. at 21-25, 34-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, \nG, J) \n \n \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement with the collection company for the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He agreed to pay $53 until the $637 balance (alleged as \n$544 in SOR) is paid in full. He provided documentation that he made the four required \n$53 payments since September 2019, which reduced the balance to $424. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE D-G, I) \n \n \nApplicant and the collection company for the $11,673 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h \nentered into a $98 per month payment agreement, with the first payment made on May \n17, 2019. The payments are electronically withdrawn from his bank account. He has \nmade all seven required payments. The balance in December 2019 was $11,317. (Tr. at \n26-27, 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE C, G, H) \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payment arrangements for the $8,815 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d. He stated that he intends to pay his debts. He will continue with the \npayment plans in place, pay off two student loans with the proceeds from a loan against \nhis 401(k), and arrange payment plans for the fourth student loan and remaining \ndelinquent debt. He has conducted independent research on finances, but he has not \nreceived formal financial counseling. (T. at 35-36, 41-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 3, 4) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a move to a different location for his \njob in 2015 and a car accident the same year. More recently, he had to travel \n\n \n6 \n \ninternationally after a family member passed away in a foreign country. The car accident \nand the death of a family member constitute conditions that were beyond his control. \n \n \nApplicant has worked consistently, albeit at two locations, since 2011. He \ncommented on his financial problems in his April 2018 SF 86 and during his background \ninterview in June 2018. He stated that he planned to pay his delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. He indicated that he was considering using his 401(k) funds to \npay his debts. His finances had actually deteriorated by the time the DOD obtained his \ncredit report in April 2019. The account for the SOR \u00b6 1.g debt was opened in June \n2018, the same month as the interview, and the last payment was made in October \n2018. As of the April 2019 credit report, he had not made any payments toward his \nother debts, and his auto loan and other small debts were past due. \n \nApplicant did not take any real action until after the SOR was issued. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). The only debt that is \ncompletely resolved is the $8,076 defaulted loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which was paid \nby garnishment. That debt is mitigated. However, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary \nmeans of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight than means \ninitiated and carried through by the debtor himself. Id. at 4. Finally, he stated that he \nintends to address his defaulted student loans and delinquent debts. However, \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \nUltimately in this case, no matter how much I want to believe Applicant, he does \nnot have a sufficient track record to enable me to trust that he will pay his debts. There \nis insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial problems will be resolved \nwithin a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues \nare recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant may reach a point where his finances \nare sufficiently in order to warrant a security clearance, but he has not established that \nhe is there at this time. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain \ndespite the presence of some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor since October 2016. He was employed as an enrollment advisor at a university from April 2015 to October 2016, and he left this job voluntarily to accept his current employment. (FORM Item 2 at 13-14.) He also has been self-employed since August 2005 as a process server. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1996 to April 2005 and received an honorable discharge. His security clearance application reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 2 at 36.) Applicant married in July 1996 and divorced in May 2005. He has three children, ages 25, 22, and 9. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2011. The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $29,852, which are reflected in credit reports from May 30, 2019; April 19, 2019; and February 10, 2018 (FORM Items 4-6.). The debts consist of collection accounts for $14,250 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $1,544 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a delinquent charge account for $3,492 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and four 1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 3 delinquent credit-card accounts for $4,280 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $2,921 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $2,349 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and $1.016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 16, 2018. On June \n13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 6, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on October 9, 2019. On October 24, 2019, a complete copy of the file of \n\n \n2 \n \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on November 6, 2019, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted in evidence without objection. The case was assigned \nto me on January 29, 2020.  \n \nEvidentiary Issue \n \nThe FORM included a summary of an interview with Applicant conducted by a \nsecurity investigator on December 31, 2018. (FORM Item 3.) The interview summary was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed \nApplicant that he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the interview summary; \nmake any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the \nPSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant submitted a response \nto the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy or completeness of the interview \nsummary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived any objections to FORM Item \n3. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case \nNo. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. \n13, 2018) (holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any \nobjection had been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the \nright to object). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor since \nOctober 2016. He was employed as an enrollment advisor at a university from April 2015 \nto October 2016, and he left this job voluntarily to accept his current employment. (FORM \nItem 2 at 13-14.) He also has been self-employed since August 2005 as a process server. \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1996 to April 2005 and received \nan honorable discharge. His security clearance application reflects that he has never held \na security clearance. (FORM Item 2 at 36.) \n \n \nApplicant married in July 1996 and divorced in May 2005. He has three children, \nages 25, 22, and 9. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2011. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $29,852, which are \nreflected in credit reports from May 30, 2019; April 19, 2019; and February 10, 2018 \n(FORM Items 4-6.). The debts consist of collection accounts for $14,250 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and \n$1,544 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a delinquent charge account for $3,492 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and four \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \ndelinquent credit-card accounts for $4,280 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $2,921 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $2,349 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e); and $1.016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant entered into an agreement to settle the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b for $1,800, to be paid at the rate of $150 per month beginning in July 2019 \nand ending in June 2020. (AX A.) He submitted AX A in his December 2019 response to \nthe FORM, but he submitted no evidence that he had made any of the required monthly \npayments from July through December 2019. He also submitted no evidence of \npayments, payment agreements, or other resolution of the other debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator, he attributed his debts \nto a slowdown in his process-server business. (FORM Item 3 at 4.) In his SOR answer, \nhe stated that he used credit cards to pay living expenses due to having a change in \ncareers. He provided no evidence explaining how a change in careers affected his ability \nto pay his debts. He stated he has cut down on his spending, but he submitted no \nevidence of a budget or plan to gain control of his finances. He submitted no evidence of \nfinancial counseling and no evidence of negotiations or other actions to resolve the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c-1.g.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. The downturn in Applicant\u2019s business as a process \nserver was a condition largely beyond his control, but he has not provided evidence of \nresponsible conduct. He submitted no evidence that he has complied with the settlement \nagreement for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and no evidence of efforts to resolve the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c-1.g.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments under \nthe settlement agreement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. A promise to pay a delinquent debt \nin the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR \nCase No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). He submitted no efforts of payments \nor other resolution of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant, 33, has worked as a tech specialist for a defense contractor since September 2017. He graduated from high school in June 2004 and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2005. He served for nine years and held the rank of sergeant (E-5) at the time of his honorable discharge. He has never deployed to a war zone. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. Applicant has been unemployed or under employed from the time of his September 2014 discharge until his current employment in 2017. From October 2014 through February 2016, he was a full-time college student and was receiving a stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. He supplemented his income working as a bouncer in bars. He has not earned a college degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Tr. at 24-30.) Applicant was indebted when he was discharged from the Marine Corps. Thereafter, his finances worsened without a regular paycheck equal to what he was making in the military until he began his current employment. He incurred a number of additional debts that he has been unable to pay. (Tr. 31-32.) 3 GUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j, Three Bank Accounts C",

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 26, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn June 7, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) setting forth allegations under \nGuidelines F and J and concluding that it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him access to classified information. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n\n2 \n \n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 9, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). He provided \na supplemental \u201cAddendum\u201d to his SOR answer on September 30, 2019. On December \n2, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On the same day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing on January 7, 2020.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented ten \nproposed exhibits, which she marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10. \nApplicant had attached two exhibits to his original SOR answer, which I marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B. At the hearing, he presented three additional proposed \nexhibits, which I marked as AE C through E. I have marked Department Counsel\u2019s Exhibit \nList as Hearing Exhibit I. The exhibits of both parties were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 21, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 33, has worked as a tech specialist for a defense contractor since \nSeptember 2017. He graduated from high school in June 2004 and enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps in September 2005. He served for nine years and held the rank of sergeant \n(E-5) at the time of his honorable discharge. He has never deployed to a war zone. He \nheld a security clearance while in the Marine Corps.  \n \n \nApplicant has been unemployed or under employed from the time of his September \n2014 discharge until his current employment in 2017. From October 2014 through \nFebruary 2016, he was a full-time college student and was receiving a stipend under the \nPost-9/11 GI Bill. He supplemented his income working as a bouncer in bars. He has not \nearned a college degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Tr. at 24-30.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted when he was discharged from the Marine Corps. \nThereafter, his finances worsened without a regular paycheck equal to what he was \nmaking in the military until he began his current employment. He incurred a number of \nadditional debts that he has been unable to pay. (Tr. 31-32.) \n \n \n\n3 \n \nGUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j, Three Bank Accounts Charged-Off in the Total Amount of \n$12,097 \u2013 The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($9,802) is for a loan used to purchase a vehicle. \nApplicant opened the loan in October 2016. He subsequently defaulted on the loan, and \nthe vehicle was repossessed. After the resale of the vehicle, Applicant was responsible \nfor the remaining balance. At one time, the creditor offered to settle the debt for about \n$1,400, but Applicant was unable to make any payments. This debt is not resolved. (GE \n2 at 6; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 14; Tr. at 34-36.) \n \n \nThe debts owed to the same creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($1,143) and 1.j \n($1,152) are for an unpaid credit card and an overdrawn bank account. He wrote in his \nSOR answer that he had reached an agreement with the bank to settle these debts with \npartial payments if made by July 19, 2019. He credibly testified that he paid these \nsettlements on time. He offered an exhibit, dated July 19, 2019, to show a payment of the \ntwo debts, which are listed on the exhibit. These debts are resolved. (SOR answer \naddendum; AE C; Tr. at 49-53.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f, Two Education Loans Placed for Collection in the Total Amount \nof $7,853. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,937) is for a student loan for a course that \nApplicant failed and was obligated to repay at that time. The education debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($916) is also owed to the same lender. Applicant has not been able to pay \nthese obligations. These debts are not resolved. (SOR answer at 2; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at \n2; Tr. at 36-40.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, Credit Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $4,419. This debt \nis for an unpaid military credit card. Applicant defaulted on this debt in July 2016. A federal \nlien has been levied against him. Payments have been made to the U.S. Government \nthrough the diversion of his federal tax refunds. Applicant has voluntarily made some \nminor payments on this account, but he has not established a repayment plan. This debt \nis not resolved. (GE 2 at 7-8; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5; Tr. at 40-41.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, Unpaid Education Account in the Amount of $3,744. In May 2016, \nApplicant opened this student loan with a second education lender. The loan is presently \nwith a collection agency acting on behalf of the Federal Government. He defaulted on the \nloan in December 2018. Applicant attached to his SOR answer a copy of a receipt \nreflecting a June 2019 payment on this account in the amount of $150. Applicant testified \nthat he is \u201cstill paying on it regularly.\u201d He tries to pay $50 or $100 on this account every \npay period \u201cas I can.\u201d He asserted that for the last eight months, he has been making \npayments at least once a month, but this is uncorroborated. A November 25, 2019 credit \nreport reflects a balance on this account of $3,685, just $59 less than the original debt \namount. Applicant is trying to pay down this debt, but has not established a payment plan \nwith the bank and has not provided documentary evidence of an appropriate track record \nof payments. This debt is not resolved. (SOR answer at 2; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. at 41-43.)  \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, Unpaid Rent in the Amount of $2,550. This debt is for unpaid rent Applicant \nowes to his former landlord. After his September 2014 discharge, when he was no longer \nreceiving his basic housing allowance, he fell behind on his rent and was evicted in June \n2015. The creditor will not work with Applicant to accept a partial payment in settlement \nof this debt. He has not made any payments on this account. This debt is not resolved. \n(SOR answer; GE 2 at 2, 7; GE 4 at 2; Tr. at 44-45.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, Unpaid Communication Accounts Placed for Collection in the \nTotal Amount of $615. Applicant testified that he has paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g \n($516) in the last couple of years while he was working for his current employer. He points \nout that the debt does not appear on his current credit report that he reviewed prior to the \nhearing. The debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s two most recent credit reports. \nThe debt is listed in GE 5, which is dated December 16, 2017. Applicant testified that he \nneeds to investigate further to establish that this debt is paid. He also believes he has \npaid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($99), but he has no record of the payment. As with \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, the smaller debt only appears on the oldest credit report \nin the record. The fact that debts are no longer listed on recent credit reports, however, \nis not reliable evidence of payment of a debts. Debts are often removed from credit reports \nfor reasons other than payments. Applicant has not established that these debts have \nbeen paid. These debts are not resolved. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 45-49.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k, Unpaid Court Costs and Fine in Amount of $161. Applicant testified that \nhe first learned about the debt when he received the SOR. He believes this debt is for a \nfee related to a substance abuse program he entered as part of the disposition of a Driving \nWhile Intoxicated (DWI) charge discussed below. He claims he was advised that he can \nonly pay this small debt if he pays his defense attorney $2,000 to resolve it for him. He \nclaims that the state will not accept a check from him directly because he had counsel in \nhis criminal case. Actually, the record evidence reflects that this debt is for a ticket he \nreceived on February 13, 2017, for operating an unlicensed motor vehicle. He did not \nappear on the April 12, 2017 trial date and was found guilty in absentia. He was fined $50 \nand ordered to pay costs of $101, for a total debt of $151. The $10 discrepancy with the \ndebt amount in the SOR allegation appears to be a typographical error. This debt is not \nresolved. (SOR answer at 3-4; GE 6; Tr. at 53-55.) \n \n \nApplicant wants to resolve his largest debts first. He has no savings and no ability \nto pay the unresolved debts. His take-home pay appears to be more than sufficient to \ncover his basic living expenses. His rent is very modest. He owns no motor vehicles, \nexcept a motorcycle. He cannot explain where he spends all of his income. (Tr. at 56-74.) \n \n \nTwo other incidents have impacted Applicant\u2019s finances. Recently, Applicant was \ninvolved in an incident with another person and a torts claim was made against him for \ncausing emotional distress. He settled the claim and made some payments to the other \nparty. In March 2018, Applicant was involved in a serious accident while riding his \nmotorcycle. He was badly injured and needed surgery. He lost work for an extended \nperiod of time, though he eventually received disability pay. He also received a settlement \nin the gross amount of about $30,000. He used those funds to pay off the loan on his \n\n5 \n \nmotorcycle and to pay his attorney. After that settlement, he did not seek financial \ncounseling to help him return to financial stability. (SOR answer at 4; AE B; Tr. at 56-74.) \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b62.a and 2.b, June 2016 DWI, 1st Offense Conviction and Warrant for Failure \nto attend Court-Ordered Alcohol Abuse Classes.  \n \n \nApplicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a that in June 2016, he was convicted \nof DWI 1st and sentenced in October 2016 to serve five days in jail. The record evidence \nreflects that the charge he pled guilty to involved a blood alcohol content, or BAC, of \n0.15% to 0.20%. He was also sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation and his \ndriver\u2019s license was restricted for limited use until October 2017. In addition, the court \nordered Applicant to attend a state alcohol substance abuse program (Program). He \nmistakenly believed that he had fulfilled all of the requirements of that Program in State 1 \nbefore he moved to State 2 to begin his employment with his current employer in \nSeptember 2017. On July 10, 2017, a charge was filed against him in State 1 for non-\ncompliance with the Program. On August 10, 2017, he was tried in absentia in State 1 \ncourt and found guilty. The court issued a capias for his arrest. Applicant has been \ndeclared to be a fugitive by State 1. (GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7 at 5; GE 8 at 1-2; GE 9 at 1.) As \nof the date of the hearing, the warrant remained outstanding.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n6 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n\n7 \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, his testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline for the eleven SOR allegations: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \n(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior has been recent, frequent, and was not under any circumstances that were so \nunusual as to make it unlikely to recur. Applicant did experience a period of \nunemployment and underemployment that was beyond his control. He had difficulty \ntransitioning from his life in the Marine Corps to civilian life from an employment \nstandpoint. Also, his March 2018 accident created additional difficulties. The record \nevidence, however, does not show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe has not sought financial counseling. His plan to pay his large debts first is a non-starter \nsince he has no savings and does not appear to have the ability to control his spending \nand save money, even though he earns a good income. Since starting his current job in \nSeptember 2017, he has not been able to make even regular small payments on his \n\n8 \n \ndebts. He has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay or resolve his debts with only two \nexceptions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j). He claims he has paid two other small debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.h), but he is unable to provide evidence of any payments. He does not dispute \nany of the remaining SOR debts. Overall, his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of DWI 1st (BAC 0.15% to 0.20%) in June 2016. He failed \nto satisfy the terms and conditions of the court-ordered Program for alcohol abuse. In July \n2016, he was charged with non-compliance. There is an outstanding warrant for his arrest \nthat he has not addressed since learning about it when he received the June 2019 SOR. \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n\n9 \n \n \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions apply. The DWI conviction occurred a \nnumber of years ago, but Applicant failed to comply with the terms of his sentence. The \ncourt subsequently issued a capias for his arrest, which remains outstanding. Applicant\u2019s \ninactions suggest that similar behavior could recur in the future and cast doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant has attempted to improve \nhimself by pursuing a college education. He eventually found a good job and has kept his \nemployment for over two years. That evidence, however, is insufficient. His \nnoncompliance with the terms of his DWI sentence and his unresolved arrest warrant are \nserious issues. It should be obvious, but it is nonetheless stated here, that any applicant \nwith an outstanding arrest warrant is not a good candidate for a security clearance. Under \nthese circumstances, it is impossible to conclude that he has experienced a successful \nrehabilitation.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. Applicant \nexperienced a difficult transition from being a Marine sergeant to a civilian. He was unable \nto complete his college degree requirements and experienced a long period of \nunemployment and underemployment. He was fortunate to find a good-paying job and to \nbegin to get his life back on track, but even then he has not been completely successful. \nHe has not sought professional help with his finances. Applicant has a strong character \nand sincerely wants to do the right thing, but he seems somewhat at a loss as to how to \nresolve his problems and to regain a solid footing after his years of honorable military \nservice.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to address the security concerns \nraised by the SOR allegations and his admissions thereto. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and J and evaluating all of the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial delinquencies and criminal conduct. \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance. (Tr. 5-6) He works as an aircraft mechanic for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since May 2017. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology awarded in October 2016. He is married, and he and his spouse share their household with five children, ages 14, 13, 12, 7, and 5. The 13-year-old child is a niece. His wife is recently employed at a call center. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force beginning in April 2003 until his release from active duty in May 2013. His separation was voluntary, although he stated that he felt forced out, and he left with a separation payment of $10,000. (Tr. 25-26) He was trained and worked as an aircraft mechanic while on active duty. After his honorable discharge from the Air Force, Applicant was unemployed from June 2013 to January 2015. He was a student during this time working on his bachelor\u2019s degree.

Nagel, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n09/15/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He also made deliberately false statements about \nhis financial record in response to questions on his security clearance application. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 15, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. He responded to written interrogatories on June 6, 2019. Thereafter, on \nJune 24, 2019, after reviewing the application and the information gathered during a \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining \nit was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \n\n \n2 \n \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline E for personal conduct (falsification) and Guideline F for financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 11, 2019. He admitted the factual \nallegations under both guidelines and provided a few explanatory remarks. He also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 3, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on December 4, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-9, with the \nexception of Exhibits 3 and 4, which were withdrawn. Applicant did not offer \ndocumentary exhibits. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on December 13, 2019.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 5-6) He works as an aircraft mechanic for a company in the defense \nindustry. He has been so employed since May 2017. His educational background \nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology awarded in October 2016. He is \nmarried, and he and his spouse share their household with five children, ages 14, 13, \n12, 7, and 5. The 13-year-old child is a niece. His wife is recently employed at a call \ncenter. (Tr. 49)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force \nbeginning in April 2003 until his release from active duty in May 2013. His separation \nwas voluntary, although he stated that he felt forced out, and he left with a separation \npayment of $10,000. (Tr. 25-26) He was trained and worked as an aircraft mechanic \nwhile on active duty.  \n \nAfter his honorable discharge from the Air Force, Applicant was unemployed \nfrom June 2013 to January 2015. He was a student during this time working on his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He had a part-time job with an aviation company from February 2015 \nto October 2016, while at the same time working on his bachelor\u2019s degree. He was then \nunemployed for a few months, from November 2016 to April 2017. He began his current \njob in May 2017, more than two years before the hearing.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2, 5-9) The SOR concerns the following matters: (1) a \nmortgage loan that went into foreclosure in 2013; (2) three car loans that ended with \nrepossession and deficiency balances of $8,313, 4,238, and $1,922; (3) five collection \nor charged-off accounts in amounts ranging from $380 to $2,299 for a total of $4,784; \nand (4) two unpaid judgments in amounts of $12,067 and $982. Applicant did not \npresent documentation to establish that any of these delinquent debts were paid, \n\n \n3 \n \nsettled, in a payment arrangement, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. (Tr. 31-\n46) A couple of these matters require further discussion.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2014Applicant obtained a mortgage loan in 2009 to buy a home for about \n$158,000. (Exhibit 6; Tr. 31-33) He bought the home with the assistance of a VA home \nloan. He was unable to make the loan payments due to a decline in income related to \nhis reduction in pay and his subsequent honorable discharge from the Air Force. A \nnotice of trustee\u2019s sale was made in September 2013 and the house was sold at auction \nin 2014. There is no indication of a deficiency balance after foreclosure; indeed, the \nJune 2017 credit report shows $0 past due. (Exhibit 7 at 5) The state where the home is \nlocated has an anti-deficiency statute that would normally prevent a lender from seeking \na deficiency judgment after foreclosure. Given the circumstances, I find this matter is \nresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2014Applicant explained that the $12,067 judgment, filed in July 2013, \nwas paid via garnishment of his wages from his current job over a two-year period. \n(Exhibit 5; Tr. 42-43) The wage garnishment took about $1,100 per month. The \njudgment does not appear in the most recent credit reports from 2019. (Exhibits 8-9) \nGiven these circumstances, I find the judgment is resolved. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant made four deliberately false statements \nwhen completing his May 2017 security clearance application and a fifth false statement \nduring the course of his November 2018 background investigation. Three of the \nallegations concerned, essentially, his failure to disclose that he was subject to non-\njudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, in about January 2013, while on active duty \nwith the Air Force. Although he admitted the allegations in his answer to the SOR, he \nclarified that he did not understand or realize that he had been subject to Article 15 \nproceedings in addition to a reduction or demotion in pay grade from E-5 to E-4. At the \nhearing, he further explained his mistaken belief or confusion concerning the Article 15 \nproceedings. (Tr. 27-30, 47-48) He stated that he received a demotion because he \nfailed to follow a technical data order while performing aircraft maintenance, but he \nunderstood the matter was limited to a demotion and no more. I found his explanation \nodd, but nonetheless credible and worthy of belief.  \n \n \nThe other two falsification allegations concern failure to disclose adverse \nfinancial information (e.g., delinquent accounts, judgments) in response to two \nquestions in the May 2017 security clearance application. Applicant admitted he lied in \nresponse to the two questions because he was worried he would not obtain the security \nclearance or his current job. (Tr. 48-49)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n\n \n4 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to \nhis separation from military service and the corresponding decline in pay and benefits. \nThose circumstances occurred several years ago in 2013. His financial problems are \nalso related to his periods of unemployment, although he has had his present full-time \njob since May 2017. While those matters were largely beyond his control, I cannot \nconclude that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has done little to \naddress his delinquent debts. The foreclosure on the mortgage loan essentially took \ncare of itself, with the benefit of a VA loan and a state with an anti-deficiency statute. \nThe single delinquent debt that was paid, the $12,067 judgment, was by wage \ngarnishment, which is not a form of voluntary payment. Otherwise, he has taken no \naction to resolve the remaining nine delinquent accounts in the SOR. Given the \ncircumstances, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, the following disqualifying condition applies  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant made two deliberately false \nstatements during the security clearance process. He omitted derogatory information \nabout his financial record in response to two questions on his May 2017 security \nclearance application. He did so because he was concerned that truthful answers would \nhave negative consequences for him. The disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.  \n \n \nIn mitigation, I have considered all the information Applicant presented, including \nhis honorable military service. I have also considered the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17, and none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Making deliberately false statements \nduring the security clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily \nexplained away, excused, or otherwise mitigated.    \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h - k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c -2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant responded to the SOR on October 16, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on December 17, 2019, and reassigned to me on January 8, 2020.  \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 15, 2020. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1, 4, and 6 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. The \nobjection to the three credit reports identified as GE 2, 3, and 5 as cumulative was \noverruled, and the exhibits were admitted.

In his response to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted owing all the debts, except he indicated that he paid the \n$413 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \n \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a debt-resolution company in June 2018. He \nenrolled ten debts in the company\u2019s debt-relief program (DRP). It appears that all but \nthe accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were included in the DRP.

The bank obtained a $1,815 judgment against him in \nAugust 2018. From July 2018 through September 2019, the company paid the law firm \n$1,347. The SOR alleges the debt with a balance of $413, which was based on an April \n2019 credit report. However, the debt was larger before the SOR was issued. The \nAugust 2018 credit report lists the balance as $1,322. The August 2019 credit report \nlists the balance as $312. The law firm accepted $185 in September 2019, as final \nsettlement of the debt. (GE 2, 3, 5, 7; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, C, J, K, P, Q, \nR) \n \n \nApplicant paid $144 in December 2019 and $146 in January 2020 to resolve the \n$275 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He also paid other debts outside the DRP. He \npaid $313 in September 2019 and $274 in December 2019 to pay two debts that were \nnot alleged in the SOR. He paid in full two payday loans that were not alleged in the \nSOR.

He lives frugally on a budget. He is \ncurrent on his student loan, which has a workable balance of about $10,700. He \ncredibly stated that he is committed to paying all his debts and to eventually becoming \ndebt free.

The supervisor described Applicant as \u201ca dedicated, capable, and \nfaithful person.\u201d (AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n4 \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent consumer \ndebts and an unpaid medical debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment. He went to \ncommunity college to learn a trade, then served an apprenticeship, and finally received \na job with his current employer in February 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a debt-resolution company in June 2018, \nmore than a year before the SOR was issued. Between June 2018 and October 2019, \nhe paid the company a total of $3,492. Only one debt alleged in the SOR was settled by \nthe company, but Applicant paid at least five other debts outside the DRP, including the \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He credibly stated that he is committed to paying all \nhis debts and to eventually becoming debt free. \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. It may take time, but I am convinced that he will \neventually resolve his financial problems.1 The above mitigating conditions are \nsufficiently applicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be \npaid off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on \nSeptember 9, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to me on November 20, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 19, 2019.

The record was held open \nfor Applicant to submit additional information.

She did not earn much money when she first \nstarted working for her employer.

(Tr. at 21-22, 27, 30-43; GE1-4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight defaulted federal student loans totaling about $38,600; a \ndefaulted $1,830 private student loan from the college Applicant attended; and six \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $487. The loans and debts are established through \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s pay is being garnished to pay her federal student loans. Her pay \nstatement from Match 19, 2020, shows that $93 was garnished from her paycheck, and \n$568 was garnished year-to-date. She retained a company that specializes in assisting \npeople manage their student loans. She paid the company $300 in January 2020 and \nanother $300 in February 2020. She entered into a $5 per month payment plan for her \nDepartment of Education loans, which should stop the garnishment. She made the first \ntwo required payments. When she completes the payment plan in January 2021, she \nshould be eligible for an income-based payment plan.1 (AE A-E) \n \nApplicant cosigned a car loan for her mother. Her mother is making the \npayments, and the loan is current. That car loan is the only non-SOR debt with a \nbalance on Applicant\u2019s credit report. Except for what she may have received from the \nstudent loan company, Applicant has not received financial counseling. She did not \nprovide proof of payments toward the medical debts and private student loan. She \nindicated that she wants to pay all of her loans and debts and reach financial stability. \n(Tr. at 45-46, 51-54; GE 3, 4) \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2018. She did not report any adverse information under the financial questions. \nShe credibly denied intentionally providing false information about her finances. She \nstated that she did not think she had to list her student loans, and she was unaware of \nher medical debts. (Tr. at 26-27, 43; GE 1) \n \n                                                        \n1 See https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven.  \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent medical debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant thought that her medical expenses were being paid by medical \ninsurance through her college. Her student loans were managed by her mother. \nApplicant did not earn much after she left college, and her student loans were not paid. \nHer pay has been garnished $568 for the federal student loans. She paid $600 to a \ncompany that specializes in assisting people manage their student loans. She entered \ninto a $5 per month payment plan for her federal student loans, which should stop the \ngarnishment. When she completes the payment plan in January 2021, she should be \neligible for an income-based payment plan.  \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are not the result of frivolous or extravagant spending, they are \nstudent loans and medical debts. Of note, the cosigned car loan for Applicant\u2019s mother \nis the only non-SOR debt with a balance on Applicant\u2019s credit report. She has a strong \nincentive to continue to pay her federal student loans, which comprise more than 90% \nof the SOR debts. The garnishment of her pay should stop, and with her federal loans in \na repayment plan, she should not have to continue to pay the student loan company. \nWith a security clearance, she will also receive additional pay. Applicant has a plan to \nresolve her financial problems. There are clear indications that they are being resolved \nand are under control. Applicant provided sufficient information to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not report any adverse information under the financial questions on \nher August 2018 SF 86. She credibly denied intentionally providing false information \nabout her finances. She stated that he did not think she had to list her student loans, \nand she was unaware of her medical debts. I found her to be honest, but \nunsophisticated about her finances. After considering all the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, age, education, and experience, I find that she did not \nintentionally provide false information about her finances on the August 2018 SF 86. AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal conduct security concerns are concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns and mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Items 2, 3, 4) Applicant graduated from high school in 1968. He served honorably in the U.S. military from 1970 to 1991. As of his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he worked as a pier riser/cable technician for a DOD contractor since November 2016. He worked for a previous DOD contractor in the same capacity from 2005 to 2016. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1972. (Items 3, 4) The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016. It also alleges that he is indebted to the U.S. Government for $38,244 in unpaid federal income taxes for tax years 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2013 through 2016, as well as incurring two federal tax liens in the amounts of $9,808 and $5,868 entered against him in June 2009 and January 2013, respectively.

In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant listed in his SCA that he failed to file and pay his 2014 through 2016 federal income returns and taxes, in the amounts of $3,192, $10,388, and $6,560, respectively.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 11, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 13, 2020 (Answer), and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government \n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted its written case on March 4, 2020. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the Government\u2019s FORM on March 20, 2020. He did not respond to \nthe Government\u2019s FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 6, 2020. The \nGovernment\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection.    \n \nSOR Amendment \n \nDepartment Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 1.j so that it reads: \u201cYou are indebted to \nAARGON COLLECTION AG for a medical account #1790192053 that has been placed \nfor collection in the approximate amount of $111.00. As of the date of this Statement of \nReasons, the account remains delinquent.\u201d  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 71 years old, \nmarried, and he has one stepchild and three children, all adults. (Items 2, 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1968. He served honorably in the U.S. \nmilitary from 1970 to 1991. As of his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he \nworked as a pier riser/cable technician for a DOD contractor since November 2016. He \nworked for a previous DOD contractor in the same capacity from 2005 to 2016. He was \nfirst granted a DOD security clearance in 1972. (Items 3, 4) \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for \ntax years 2014 through 2016. It also alleges that he is indebted to the U.S. Government \nfor $38,244 in unpaid federal income taxes for tax years 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2013 \nthrough 2016, as well as incurring two federal tax liens in the amounts of $9,808 and \n$5,868 entered against him in June 2009 and January 2013, respectively. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.d). The SOR and amended SOR also allege that he has an $823 delinquent \nconsumer debt and five delinquent medical debts totaling $2,773 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j).  \n \n \nIn addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant listed in his SCA that he \nfailed to file and pay his 2014 through 2016 federal income returns and taxes, in the \namounts of $3,192, $10,388, and $6,560, respectively. He further discussed his \nfinancial issues, to include his delinquent federal income taxes of $38,244 and his \nfederal tax liens totaling $15,676, during his October 2015 and August 2018 interviews \nwith a background investigator and in his July 2019 response to interrogatories. His tax \nliens and his medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are reported on his 2015 credit \nbureau report. His tax liens, his consumer debt, and all of his medical debts are \nreported on his 2018 credit bureau report. (Items 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax liens, in his 2015 background interview, to his wife \nlosing money in her 401(k) retirement account in tax year 2000, his withdrawal of money \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfrom his 401(k) retirement account in tax year 2001, and their failure to pay the correct \namount of federal income taxes for tax periods 2000 and 2001. He stated that after the \nIRS informed them of their resultant tax indebtedness, they worked with a tax attorney \nand reached a payment plan with the IRS of $250 monthly to resolve his liens, which he \npaid from 2005 to January 2015. He stated that he contacted the IRS in 2015 because \nhe was not employed full time, and the collection of his liens were consequently placed \non hold. (Item 4)  \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent federal income taxes for tax periods 2014 \nthrough 2016, in his 2018 background interview, to his tax preparer\u2019s failure to file, \nunbeknownst to him and his wife, their joint federal income tax returns for those years. \nHe also stated that their tax preparer told them that they did not owe any federal income \ntaxes for those years. He stated that he first learned about his predicament in \napproximately 2017, when the IRS mailed him and his wife correspondence informing \nthem about their federal tax indebtedness for tax periods 2014 through 2016. He stated \nthat when he and his wife were set to begin paying their delinquent taxes for those \nyears, they received another letter from the IRS in around mid-2017 stating that their \ntaxes were not in collection, though they were still responsible for paying them. He \nfurther stated that the IRS told them not to begin repaying their delinquent federal taxes \nuntil they were told to do so, and they had not since heard from the IRS. He stated in his \n2019 response to interrogatories that he was in a payment plan with the IRS of $265 \nmonthly. (Items 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent medical debts, in his 2015 background \ninterview, to a 2012 surgery. He stated that he would contact his medical creditors to \nverify the debts and make efforts to resolve them. In his 2018 background interview, he \nstated that he was unaware of his delinquent consumer and medical debts, as his wife \nhandled their finances, but he would look into and pay them if they were valid. (Items 3, \n4) \n \n \nIRS documentation from August 2017 reflects that Applicant and his wife owe \n$38,244 in federal taxes for tax years 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2013 through 2016. It \nreflects that the IRS \u201ctemporarily closed [their] collection case\u201d after determining that it \nwas \u201ccurrently not collectible\u201d and Applicant could not \u201cpay the money [he] owe[d] at this \ntime.\u201d However, it also reflects that Applicant still owed the amount, which included \npenalty and interest calculated to September 1, 2017, and that the IRS would continue \nto charge penalties and interest until he paid the amount owed in full. It also reflects that \nthe IRS would file a federal tax lien to protect the U.S. Government\u2019s interest, and that \nthe IRS \u201cmay re-open [his] case and resume collection activities in the future if [his] \nfinancial situation improves.\u201d (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his 2015 background interview that he had not received any \nfinancial counseling or engaged any debt consolidation services. In his 2019 response \nto interrogatories, he stated that he was working with a tax attorney to resolve his tax \nissues. (Item 4) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to pay $38,244 in federal income taxes for tax years 2005, 2009, \n2010, and 2013 through 2016, as required. He was also unable to pay his consumer \nand medical debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e to 1.j. \nSince SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d essentially duplicate the underlying facts of SOR \u00b6 1.b, I \nfind for Applicant on those allegations.   \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe following conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems: Applicant\u2019s 2012 surgery; Applicant\u2019s tax preparer\u2019s failure to file, \nunbeknownst to him and his wife, their joint federal income tax returns for tax years \n2014 through 2016; the tax preparer\u2019s indication to them that they did not owe federal \nincome taxes for those tax years; and Applicant\u2019s loss of full-time employment in 2015.  \n \n \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he \nacted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant has not demonstrated that he \nmade efforts to resolve or is currently resolving his outstanding federal taxes. He has \nnot provided any documentation to corroborate his claims of payment to the IRS. A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017). \nIn addition, he has not demonstrated that he has taken any steps toward resolving his \ndelinquent consumer and medical debts. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) are not established.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b, 1.e-1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq. \n \n \n04/29/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 15, 2018. On \nJune 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), \napplicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 6, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 6, 2019, and the hearing was convened on January 8, \n2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. The \nrecord was held open until January 21, 2020, to permit submission of additional \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant submitted additional documents collectively marked as \nAE I, and admitted into evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript \non January 16, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old mobility services engineer for a defense contractor, \nemployed since September 2018. His spouse works for another government agency, and \nthey maintain separate finances. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2004, and \nattended employment certification training programs. He served on active duty in the \nUnited States Navy from 1988 to 1995, and in the Navy Reserve from 1995 to 1997. He \nalso served in the Navy Reserve from 2005 to 2018, but left with an administrative \nseparation due to unsatisfactory performance. Applicant deployed to the Arabian Gulf for \nOperation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990 to 1991, and was awarded the Combat \nAction Ribbon and Presidential Unit Citation after his ship struck a mine. He also deployed \nto Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010 for Operation Enduring Freedom. All periods of military \nservice resulted in honorable discharges.  \n \nApplicant married in 1999, and has two children. He and his spouse were \nphysically separated from 2015 to 2017 while his spouse was assigned overseas. He \ntestified that he was unemployed from about June 2013 to March 2015 while helping his \nill father. He claims self-employment from January to December 2017, which conflicts \nwith his SCA report of being out of work for all of 2017. Applicant testified that he was \nhomeless for three to four months in 2017, then lived with his father. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nwas not aware of his homelessness, but he was supported by his rental income and help \nfrom his spouse, while working on investment properties he and his father own. He and \nhis spouse reunited in September 2017. Applicant has had previous security clearances \nfrom DOD and another government agency. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $64,000 in 13 delinquent debts. \nIn addition, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA by deliberately failing to \ndisclose his debts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m. Applicant admitted all of the SOR \ndebts with explanations, but denied the falsification allegation. The SOR debts include \ncollections for two recreational vehicle loans, credit cards, medical collections, and two \nlines of credit.  \n \nApplicant testified that all of the SOR debts were incurred to pay expenses or were \ndefaults during periods of unemployment or underemployment, or from medical expenses \npossibly from an accident and hernia operation. He stated he has some tentative payment \nplans, but is waiting to enter into agreements until he knows if his security clearance will \n\n \n3 \n \nbe granted and he will maintain his job. Applicant\u2019s employer, friend and coworker \nprovided letters of support, stating that he is a valued member, trusted, honest, \nexperienced, and loyal. His employer recommends him for a security clearance. \n \nIn Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s SCA, Applicant was asked about his financial record. \nHe reported that he was out of work from June 2013 to March 2015, and that he was \nunemployed for the entire year of 2017, and helping his father transition to new housing. \nHe noted in his SCA that he was currently utilizing financial assistance from a consumer \ncredit counselor, beginning in 2013. He stated the counseling agency provided a \nconfidential comprehensive personal money management interview, and they created a \ncase action plan for himself. He noted several counseling sessions since 2013 to update \nthe information, and that he was currently using the plan to stay on financial track and \nassist him with his financial difficulties. In an optional comment, he noted that the detailed \nsummary of his financial difficulties are listed in the action plan, generated by the credit \ncounselor. \n \nIn SCA Section 26, he was also asked to disclose delinquencies involving routine \naccounts; including whether in the past seven years he had a judgment; lien; \nrepossession; defaulted loans; debts in collections; suspended, charged off, or canceled \ncredit cards; or if he had been over 120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt or currently over \n120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant claimed that when \nhe completed his SCA, he attached an \u201caction plan\u201d detailing his debts and his intended \nplan to resolve them. Nowhere in the comments to the SCA did Applicant state that the \naction plan was separately attached to the SCA, or included with his electronic \nsubmission. Department Counsel stated that he did not have any attachments from the \nSCA, nor were any attachments mentioned or noted in the SCA. In Applicant\u2019s interview \nwith a Government investigator, he noted that he did have debts turned over to \ncollections, and that he attached a copy of his credit counseling report to his SCA, \ndetailing his collection accounts. Applicant believes that by attaching the action plan to \nhis SCA submission, he provided sufficient notice to the Government about his delinquent \ndebts. Attached to his Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a \u201ccase action plan\u201d from \nthe credit counseling company dated May 16, 2016.  \n \nApplicant submitted in evidence, information from another credit management \ncompany, dated November 27, 2018, and January 15, 2020 (AE E and I). He also \nsubmitted an enrollment letter from a financial education company, dated July 26, 2019 \n(AE H). Applicant\u2019s January 2020 personal financial statement shows a negative $1,296 \nnet remainder, but his proposed financial statement shows a positive $533 net remainder. \nAs of January 2020, his salary was substantially increased to $80,000 per year, and he \nreceives income from two investment properties. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n4 \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \n\n \n5 \n \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n6 \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant history of financial delinquencies likely resulted from his periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, but the debts remain unresolved. Applicant \nintends to resolve the accounts if he is assured of a security clearance and a job, but is \nreluctant to obligate himself to payment plans if he is to lose his job for lack of a clearance.  \nPromises or plans for future debt resolution are insufficient to apply mitigation credit for \nresponsible actions or good-faith efforts. Applicant has not shown that he has undertaken \nreasonable efforts to resolve his delinquent debts, has not proffered settlement plans, \nand there is insufficient evidence to show that the debts will be resolved within a \nreasonable time.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status has been poor for some time, and there is insufficient \nevidence that it will improve in the near future. He has provided evidence of attending \nfinancial counseling and showed an intent to continue with that, and he has worked on a \nbudget to get back in fiscal health. However, he is reluctant to pursue recommended \nremedies until he is assured of security eligibility and continued employment, so he has \nnot shown clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial status continues to raise significant doubts about his \nfinancial management decisions, personal responsibility, and ability to address his \ndelinquent debts. I am not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, and his \nfinancial status continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. No mitigating condition fully applies. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the \nburden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. (See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)) An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010)) \n \n  \nI find Applicant made a good-faith effort to report his delinquent debts on his SCA \nby discussing his financial counseling and later disclosing his debts in his interview. He \nreported that he attached an action plan to his SCA, despite none being included in the \nrecord. There is sufficient evidence that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SCA by \nknowingly omitting financial delinquencies. I find that based on Applicant\u2019s answer and \ntestimony, his failure to report the SOR debts on his SCA was not intentional. He provided \nplausible explanations for his omissions, and intentional falsification is not supported by \nthe evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. The personal conduct security \nconcern is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, employment history, financial difficulties, unemployment and \nunderemployment. However, I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility and \nability, intent, and desire to resolve his financial obligations. The personal conduct \nallegation is resolved in favor of Applicant. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nMay 7, 2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn June 11, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 1, 2019.  She requested that her case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 1.)  On \nOctober 31, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, was \nmailed to Applicant and received by her on November 13, 2019.  The FORM notified \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant \nsubmitted no response to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Government Items 1 \nthrough 8, and they are admitted into evidence, referenced hereinafter as Government \nExhibits 1 through 8.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 46 years old, and married with three children, and one step-child.  \nShe has a high school diploma.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Stock \nClerk.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant incurred five delinquent debts owed to creditors \non accounts that were charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately \n$87,517.  In her answer, Applicant partially admits and partially denies each of the \ndebts.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 22, 2017; April 16, 2019; and \nOctober 23, 2019, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 8.)   \n \nApplicant began working for her current employer in 2007.  Since then, there \nhave been no noted interruptions in her employment.  Applicant asserts that each of the \naccounts listed in the SOR have now been brought current or have been disputed with \nthe collection company.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  Applicant has not provided any \nevidence to support this assertion.  \n   \n \n  The following delinquent debts are of security concern: \n \na. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for a home equity line of credit account was \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $64,108.  Applicant denies the debt, \nclaiming that it was brought current in July 2019.  Applicant\u2019s credit reports \ndisclose that this was a joint account that was last paid in 2017, and was \ncharged-off in October 2019.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  Applicant has provided no \ndocumentary evidence in the record to show that the account is current.  \nAccordingly, this allegation is found against the Applicant. \n \nb. A delinquent debt owed to a bank in the amount of $12,749 was charged off.  \nApplicant denies the debt and claims that she disputed the debt with the \ncollection agency.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant provided no documentary \nevidence to show that the debt was disputed or resolved.  However, since \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that she was only an authorized user on the \n\n \n3 \n \naccount, this allegation is considered to be mitigated.  Accordingly, this allegation \nin found for the Applicant.   \n \nc.  A delinquent debt owed to a bank in the amount of $7,503 was placed for \ncollection.  Applicant denies this debt, claiming that it is not her debt.  Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report indicates that this was a joint account that was last paid in 2014.  \n(Government Exhibit 6.)  Her most recent credit report reflects, \u201cConsumer \ndisputes after resolution\u201d and reflects that the account continues to have a \nbalance of $7,503.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  Applicant provided no documentary \nevidence to show that the debt is not her debt.  Accordingly, this allegation is \nfound against the Applicant.   \n \nd.  A delinquent debt owed to a bank in the amount of $2,875 was charged-off.  \nApplicant admits this debt and claims that she has paid it.  Applicant has \nprovided no documentary evidence to show that the debt has been resolved.  \nApplicant\u2019s credit report reflect that this is a joint account that was charged off for \n$7,875 in October 2017 and continues to have a balance due of $1,195.  \n(Government Exhibit 6.)  Accordingly, this allegation is found against the \nApplicant.    \n \ne.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $282 was placed for \ncollection.  Applicant admits the debt and claims that she paid it.  One of \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflects that the account had been placed for collection \nand had a balance due of $282 as of November 2017.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  \nApplicant has not provided any documentary evidence to show that she resolved \nthe debt.  However, since her most recent credit report does not reflect the debt \nas owing, this allegation will be considered mitigated.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  \nAccordingly, this allegation is found for the Applicant.  \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n  \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated August 21, 2017.  In \nresponse to Section 26, Financial, she was asked, \u201cIn the past seven years have you \nhad any possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed? \n. . . In the past seven years have you defaulted on any type of loan? . . . In the past \nseven years have you had bills or debt turned over to a collection agency? . . . In the \npast seven years, have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled for failing to pay as agreed? . . . In the past seven years have you been over \n120 days delinquent on any debt not previously entered? . . . Are you currently over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt?\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d, and failed to list that she had \nbeen delinquent on debts in the past seven years, as noted in Guideline F above.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn December 21, 2018, as part of her security clearance background \ninvestigation, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nDepartment of Defense.  During the interview, Applicant disclosed that her husband had \nbeen laid off from approximately April 2014 to December 2015, and that they had fallen \nbehind on paying their bills.  Applicant was unsure why she had not listed the debts on \nthe security clearance application, and was unable to provide details regarding the \ndelinquent accounts.  She stated that she intended to speak to her spouse regarding \nthe debts.  According to the investigator\u2019s summary, the Applicant was given the \nopportunity to provide additional documentation regarding the financial delinquencies \nand she did not do so despite being contacted several times via phone and e-mail.  \n(Government Exhibit 5.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that she has not paid.  At this time \nthere is insufficient information in the record to conclude that she is financially stable, or \nthat she can afford her lifestyle, or that she has the financial resources available to \nhandle her financial obligations.  There is no evidence in the record to show that any \n\n \n6 \n \nregular monthly payments of any sort are being made toward her debts.  The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \nDuring her security clearance interview with the investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged her financial difficulties, and said that her husband was laid off from April \n2014 to December 2015.  However, she provided no further details about this situation.  \nWithout more information, the record is void of mitigation.  There is no evidence in the \nrecord to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her \nfinancial difficulties.  There is no detail in the record to show how or why Applicant \nbecame so delinquently indebted.  Nor is there evidence to show that Applicant has \nmade any effort to resolve her debts.  To date, Applicant has not provided any \ndocumentation corroborating her claims to have brought the accounts current or \ndisputed them and/or has been released from responsibility.  What is known is that \nApplicant has been gainfully employed since 2007 and yet remains excessively \nindebted.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  This guideline is found against the \nApplicant.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reveal that she was very far behind on several accounts \nat the time she completed the security clearance application in August 2017.  \nFurthermore, several accounts were charged off only a short time after completing the \napplication, in October 2017.  It can be presumed that she knew about her delinquent \ndebts at the time she completed the security clearance application.  Applicant \ndeliberately concealed her financial delinquencies from the government on this \napplication.    There is no excuse for this dishonesty.  Deliberately concealing material \ninformation from the government on a security clearance application raises serious \nquestions about one\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness.  None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable.  This guideline is found against the Applicant.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was given several \nopportunities to provide documentation to support her assertions concerning her \nfinancial delinquencies and chose not to submit anything.  First, Applicant did not take \nadvantage of the opportunity she was given by the investigator to provide \ndocumentation, despite several attempts following her interview to obtain this \ninformation.  Second, Applicant did not provide this evidence in her answer to the SOR.  \nThird, Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM.  Insufficient mitigation has \nbeen shown.  Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.c, and 1.d.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b., and 1.e. \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 17, 2017. After a \nbackground investigation, which included Applicant\u2019s interview by a security investigator \nin April 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhis application. On July 17, 2019, the DOD CAF sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 16, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on October 3, 2019. On October 4, 2019, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on October 23, 2019, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 9, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, \n1.g-1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.j. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor and is currently \ndeployed overseas. He has been employed by defense contractors since May 2017. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1996 to November 2016, when he \nretired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). He held a security clearance in the \nArmy and retained it as an employee of a defense contractor.  \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1996. He and his wife have three daughters, ages 26, \n22, and 21. He has a 13-year-old son from a relationship that occurred while he was \nseparated from his wife in 2005. He pays child support of $400 per month for his son. \n(FORM Item 5 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2002, listing assets of \n$22,506 and liabilities of $20,300. He completed the payment plan and received a \ndischarge in October 2005. (FORM Item 12.) This bankruptcy was not alleged in the \nSOR. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four Chapter 13 bankruptcies that he filed between April 2014 \nand January 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). The evidence concerning these bankruptcies is \nsummarized below.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant filed a bankruptcy petition on April 1, 2014, while he was on \nactive duty. (FORM Item 11.) He owned and occupied a home near his military duty \nstation. He was reassigned to another duty station and decided to rent his home. When \nhis tenants stopped paying their rent, Applicant was unable to pay the mortgage loan on \nthe home as well as his rent at the new duty station. He stopped making payments on \nthe mortgage loan in June 2013, and the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings. \nApplicant filed the bankruptcy petition in April 2014 to stop the foreclosure.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant filed this petition, his monthly pay and allowances were $6,435. \nHis wife, a joint debtor, was not employed outside the home. He listed assets of \n$213,859 and liabilities of $296,818. His secured debts were his mortgage loan, home \n\n \n3 \n \nfurniture, and two vehicles. He listed unsecured debts totaling $28,122, including \n$13,975 in student loans.  \n \nThe petition was dismissed in June 2014. Applicant attributed the dismissal to his \nattorney\u2019s failure to timely file required documents. However, the bankruptcy record \nreflects that it was dismissed in response to the trustee\u2019s objection to confirmation of the \npayment plan and a motion to dismiss on several grounds, including the following: that \nApplicant failed to make payments into the plan; that the plan would extend beyond 60 \nmonths; that it failed to include Applicant\u2019s child-support obligation and his rental \nexpense at his new residence; that it provided for an excessive amount of disposable \nincome toward automobile debt; and that it proposed to retain his rental property with \nnegative equity. (FORM Item 11.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant filed another bankruptcy petition on July 3, 2014. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he asserted that he dismissed this petition because the \nbankruptcy attorney failed to stop the foreclosure process. However, the bankruptcy \nrecord reflects that the bankruptcy was dismissed on motion of the trustee. The trustee \nobjected to the plan on multiple grounds, including the following: that the plan as \nproposed would extend beyond 60 months; that Applicant had failed to maintain the \nrequired payments; that the plan proposed to pay $29,068 for two automobiles, \nindicating a lack of good faith by \u201cattempting to refinance an auto purchase through the \nChapter 13 plan\u201d; and that Applicant proposed to retain non-residential real property \n\u201cthat only serves as a drain on the estate.\u201d The trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss the \nbankruptcy was granted in September 2014, rendering Applicant ineligible to file \nanother bankruptcy petition for 180 days. (FORM Item 10.) The foreclosure of the rental \nproperty was completed in July 2015, ten months after this bankruptcy was dismissed. \n(FORM Item 14.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September \n2016, when he was on terminal leave before retiring from active duty in November \n2016. It was dismissed in December 2016 on motion of the trustee for several defects in \nthe proposed payment plan and for failure to make the payments. (FORM Item 9 at 2, \ndocuments 19 and 23.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he decided not \nto pursue the bankruptcy because he had a job offer to start work in December 2016. \nHowever, his SCA reflects that he was unemployed from November 2016 to May 2017. \n(FORM Item 4 at 12.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in January \n2017, which was dismissed in April 2017. In his answer to the SOR, he asserted that he \ndismissed the petition because he had obtained employment overseas and had begun \nearning sufficient income to address his financial obligations. The trustee\u2019s motion to \ndismiss cited Applicant\u2019s failure to make payments, pointed out that the plan failed to \nprovide for Applicant\u2019s monthly $400 child-support obligation, and pointed out that the \nplan proposed to pay $38,617 for four automobiles, indicating a lack of good faith. The \npetition was dismissed with prejudice, rendering Applicant ineligible to file another \npetition for 180 days. (FORM Item 9, document 23.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges 12 delinquent debts, totaling about $30,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-\n1.l). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: auto loan charged off for $16,706. This debt arose when Applicant \nco-signed a loan for his daughter. (FORM Item 5 at 4.) It was charged off in January \n2019 and was settled in June 2019 for less than the full balance. (FORM Items 6 at 4; \nFORM Item 13 at 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: auto loan charged off for $4,992. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe asserted that he had been making monthly payments since 2017 on this debt and \nthat the account was current. The credit report from March 2019 reflects that the debt \nwas charged off for $10,554 in January 2017, that the debt was disputed, and that a \nreinvestigation was in process. (FORM Item 6 at 4.) The reduction in the amount \ncharged off supports Applicant\u2019s assertion that he had been making payments. The debt \nis not reflected in the September 2019 credit report and is too recent to have aged off \nhis credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, indicating that the dispute was \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (FORM Item 13.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: line of credit charged off for $1,522. This debt was included in the \nJuly 2014 and January 2017 bankruptcies. (FORM Items 8 and 10.) In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he asserted that a law firm was assisting him in resolving the debt. \nIt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: installment sales contract for furniture, placed for collection of \n$1,204. Applicant stopped making payments on this debt in August 2016, and it was \nincluded in the January 2017 bankruptcy. (FORM Item 8.) The September 2019 credit \nreport reflects that the debt is charged off. (FORM Item 13.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he asserted that a law firm was assisting him in resolving this debt. It is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: credit-union debt, placed for collection of $428. This debt was \nincluded in the January 2017 bankruptcy. (FORM Item 8.) The September 2019 credit \nreport reflects that the debt is unpaid. (FORM Item 13 at 2.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he asserted that a law firm was assisting him in resolving this debt. It is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: military credit-card account past due for $106. The September \n2019 credit report reflects that this account is current. (FORM Item 13 at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: cellphone account placed for collection of $3,683. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that his monthly service bill with his cellphone provider \nwas current, but that this debt is for six cellphones that the provider refused to take \nback. This account was referred for collection after Applicant\u2019s last bankruptcy was filed \nand dismissed. The March 2019 credit report reflects that this debt is disputed. (FORM \nItem 6 at 9.) The debt is not reflected in the September 2019 credit report and is too \n\n \n5 \n \nrecent to have aged off his credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, indicating \nthat the dispute was resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (FORM Item 13.). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: credit-union debt, placed for collection of $428. This debt appears \nto be a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n6 \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in May 2002 was not alleged in the SOR and \nmay not be an independent ground for revoking Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nHowever, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s \ncredibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person \nanalysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the \nMay 2002 bankruptcy for these limited purposes. In this case, the May 2002 bankruptcy \nreflects Applicant\u2019s long history of financial problems and his familiarity with the \nbankruptcy process that he relied on to abuse it during his four subsequent \nbankruptcies. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe same debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i alleging the debt to original creditor and \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleging the debt to the collection agency hired by the original creditor. When \nthe same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR \u00b6 1.l for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s reassignment while on active duty, the \nfailure of his tenant to pay the rent, and his unemployment for five months after retiring \nwere conditions beyond his control. Although he received retired pay during his five \nmonths of unemployment, it was considerably less than his active-duty pay, and he no \nlonger received the non-taxable allowances for housing and subsistence. However, he \ndid not act responsibly. He abused the bankruptcy process by repeatedly failing to make \n\n \n8 \n \nrequired payments and proposing unrealistic payment plans. He took no significant \nactions to resolve his debts after his last bankruptcy was dismissed in April 2017, until \nhe was questioned about his debts by a security investigator in April 2019 and realized \nthat his security clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who waits until his clearance is \nin jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those \nwith access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant received financial counseling in \nconnection with his bankruptcies, but his financial problems are not yet resolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which was resolved \nshortly after it was charged off; the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which has been resolved; \nand the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, on which the payments are current. It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, because Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence of payments, payment plans, or other resolution of these debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.k, which were \nsuccessfully disputed. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \n\n \n9 \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d and 1.g-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.f, and 1.j-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n  \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n08/26/2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for access to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate \nhis history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non October 21, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on June 21, 2019, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 15, 2019. He admitted the factual \nallegations, he provided a two-page memorandum in explanation, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 6, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 25, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-3. Applicant \ndid not offer documentary exhibits. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 7, 2019.    \n \nThe record was kept open until October 9, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. He made a timely \nsubmission, and the documents (along with the e-mail correspondence) are admitted \nwithout objections as Exhibits A-G.      \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to retain or obtain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 5-7) He works as a mission or quality assurance manager for a large \ncompany in the defense industry. He has been so employed since September 2013. His \neducational background includes a high school diploma and some college. His \nemployment history also includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force beginning in \n2001 until his release from active duty in September 2013. (Exhibit C) His decorations \ninclude the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 2 service stars.  \n \nApplicant has been separated from his wife, whom he married in 2009, since \nSeptember 2013. He has three minor children, one before the marriage and two after \nthe separation. (Tr. 29-33) He pays $667 per month in court-ordered child support for \nhis first child, and he pays about $800 per month in voluntary child support for his \nyounger children. In total, his child-support obligation is about $1,467 per month. He \nprovides health insurance for his three children via his own policy. (Tr. 65-66)  He also \nprovides spending money to his son and helps pay for daycare for a daughter. (Tr. 64-\n65)  \n \nApplicant has done well in his employment in the defense industry, as shown by \nreceiving promotions and pay raises over the last several years. He increased his \nannual earnings from about $48,000 in 2014 to about $115,000 in 2019. (Answer; \nExhibit G)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2-3) The SOR concerns 11 charged-off, in collection, \nor past-due accounts ranging in amounts from $191 to $5,496 for a total of \napproximately $18,584.  \n \nApplicant explained and presented documentation to show that he is making \nmonthly payments on three collection accounts placed with the same creditor, as \n\n \n3 \n \nreflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g in the amounts of $1,025, $1,014, and $958, \nrespectively. (Exhibits A, B, D, and F) He is paying a total of $160 per month, and he \nhas reduced the outstanding balances to $641, $936, and $889, respectively, as of \nOctober 2019. (Exhibits D and F). His plan is to repay the delinquent debts three at a \ntime unless he receives another promotion with a salary increase that would allow him \nto accelerate debt repayment. (Tr. 25-26) The other eight delinquent debts in the SOR \nhave not been paid, settled, entered into a repayment arrangement, cancelled, forgiven, \nor otherwise resolved.  \n \nApplicant presented an October 2019 credit report that is consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. (Exhibit D) It reflects 11 adverse accounts, 10 of which are \nalleged in the SOR. It also reflects six satisfactory accounts, some of which are closed. \nHis credit score ranges from 585 to 579, which is described as \u201cneeds work.\u201d (Exhibit E)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent indebtedness to the financial setback he \nexperienced upon his honorable discharge from military service in 2013. (Answer; Tr. \n22-25) He points to a combination of circumstances: (1) his premature separation from \nthe Air Force and his concurrent separation from his spouse; (2) the loss of various \nfinancial benefits he enjoyed due to his military service; (3) the initial decline in pay \ncompared with his military pay; and (4) providing family and friends with financial \nassistance (e.g., he co-signed an auto loan for a friend that ended in repossession of \nthe vehicle and a $5,496 charged-off account as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a). He also \nacknowledged being young and irresponsible with money by buying new cars every few \nyears when he was in the Air Force and also by helping others. (Tr. 56-57) He has a \ndifferent attitude today and is motivated by his desire to provide for his children. (Tr. 57)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to \nseparation from military service and the corresponding decline in pay and benefits, and \nthe separation from his spouse. Both events occurred in 2013. Those are significant life \nevents that can effect if not overwhelm even a well-adjusted person. While those \nmatters were largely beyond his control, given the passage of about six years \n(September 2013 to September 2019), I cannot conclude that he has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He has done little to address his delinquent debts. His recent \nremedial actions beginning in 2019 were likely motivated by this case. Given the \ncircumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor.   \n \n \nApplicant made a belated effort to resolve his delinquent financial accounts. He \nreceives credit for making $160 monthly payments on the three collection accounts \nplaced for collection with the same creditor, as mentioned above. He has reduced the \nbalances on each debt, but has nearly $2,500 more to repay (or about 15 monthly \npayments) as of October 2019. The other eight delinquent debts remain untouched until \nhe completes repaying the first three collection accounts. Given the circumstances, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor, but only to a limited \nextent.  \n \n \nApplicant was both sincere and candid when he expressed his intention to \nresolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow \nthrough on his stated plan and repay his delinquent debts, a task he neglected for \nseveral years. Although there is some evidence in mitigation, the evidence is not \nsufficient at this point to justify full mitigation of the security concern stemming from his \nhistory of financial problems. \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I gave him credit for his honorable \nmilitary service, which includes deployments to Afghanistan. I conclude that he did not \n\n \n6 \n \nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 51 years old. He has been married since 1993, and has a 24-year-old son and a teenage daughter. In 1990, he received a diploma after attending a two-year technical program. He has worked as an electrical and electronics mechanic for a defense contractor since August 2002. This is his second security clearance application. (Item 3; Item 4) The SOR alleges four consumer debts totaling $21,448 and $17,500 in outstanding federal income taxes. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all five of the allegations without explanation. According to Applicant, his financial issues were the result of car repairs for a vehicle, paying for his son\u2019s college education, a 2018 reduction in income, and co-signing an automobile loan for his son, who subsequently failed to make the payments. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4) During his September 2018 personal subject interview, Applicant told the government investigator that the alleged $1,752 credit-card debt was incurred to pay for vehicle repairs. In approximately June 2015, he fell behind on the payments and paid less than the required monthly minimum payment. The account was ultimately placed for collection and charged off. Although Applicant told the investigator that he would contact the creditor to resolve the debt by December 2018, the debt remains outstanding and unpaid.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n06/08/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts and outstanding federal taxes. National security eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 2, 2018. On July 23, \n2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant answered \n(Answer) the SOR on August 31, 2019, and requested a decision on the written record \nwithout a hearing.  \n \nOn January 2, 2020, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was mailed to Applicant. He received the FORM on January 9, 2020. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, and the case was assigned to me on May 12, \n2020. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \n \n\n \n \n2 \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He has been married since 1993, and has a 24-year-old \nson and a teenage daughter. In 1990, he received a diploma after attending a two-year \ntechnical program. He has worked as an electrical and electronics mechanic for a defense \ncontractor since August 2002. This is his second security clearance application. (Item 3; \nItem 4) \n \nThe SOR alleges four consumer debts totaling $21,448 and $17,500 in outstanding \nfederal income taxes. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all five of the \nallegations without explanation. According to Applicant, his financial issues were the \nresult of car repairs for a vehicle, paying for his son\u2019s college education, a 2018 reduction \nin income, and co-signing an automobile loan for his son, who subsequently failed to \nmake the payments. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4)  \n \nDuring his September 2018 personal subject interview, Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that the alleged $1,752 credit-card debt was incurred to pay for \nvehicle repairs. In approximately June 2015, he fell behind on the payments and paid less \nthan the required monthly minimum payment. The account was ultimately placed for \ncollection and charged off. Although Applicant told the investigator that he would contact \nthe creditor to resolve the debt by December 2018, the debt remains outstanding and \nunpaid. (Item 3 at 31-32; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8) \n \nApplicant purchased a vehicle in August 2015 for $15,787. In November 2016, he \nfell behind on the payments because he was providing financial support to his son who \nwas in college. The vehicle was repossessed in August 2017 and sold at auction. The \noutstanding balance for the vehicle is $5,758, which remains unpaid and unresolved. \n(Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 6 at 9) \n \nAccording to Applicant, he closed his cellular-phone account with Company A in \nSeptember 2016 and paid the bill in full. Company A sent an additional bill to him for $193, \nwhich he failed to pay. He told the investigator that he would resolve the debt shortly after \nthe September 2018 interview. This debt does not appear in his most recent credit report; \nhowever, he provided no documentation to show that the debt has been paid and \nresolved. (Item 4 at 7; Item 6 at 8) \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant co-signed an automobile loan for his son\u2019s vehicle. \nIn April 2017, his son fell behind on the monthly loan payments. Applicant sent his son \nmoney to help him catch up on the payments, but the vehicle was ultimately repossessed. \nThe outstanding balance is $13,745, and it remains unpaid and unresolved. (Item 4 at 6-\n7; Item 5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 8) \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant included Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) transcripts for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Applicant filed \nthe returns for his federal income taxes in a timely manner. However, he failed to have \n\n \n \n3 \nenough money withheld from his paychecks and accrued tax debts for tax years 2013, \n2015, 2016, and 2017, the remaining balance totals over $17,500. (Item 4 at 7, 12-39) \n \nStarting in April 2014, Applicant entered into various installment-payment \nagreements with the IRS. According to Applicant, he failed to comply with these \nagreements due, in part, to a reduction in his income in 2017. In 2013 Applicant\u2019s adjusted \ngross income (AGI) was almost $130,000; his 2014 AGI was almost $133,000; his 2015 \nAGI was almost $143,000; his 2016 AGI was almost $160,000; and his 2017 AGI was \n$133,550. In May 2019, he entered into a new installment agreement for the four relevant \ntax years. However, he did not provide proof of ongoing and continuing payments \npursuant to the May 2019 installment agreement. There is no evidence in the record that \nApplicant has obtained credit counseling. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7, 12-39) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n \n4 \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish three disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax as required.\u201d). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n\n \n \n5 \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in May 2019. \nHowever, he failed to provide proof that he is in compliance with these arrangements. \nAdditionally, he has not paid or resolved his outstanding consumer debts. Applicant did \nnot demonstrate that his financial issues were due to conditions beyond his control, nor \ndid he act responsibly to address his obligations. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \nand 20(d) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and outstanding federal \ntaxes. The record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he is reliable, trustworthy, \nand exercises good judgment. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Karoian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/20/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence. Eligibility for \na security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86). The Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him on June 7, \n2019, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and \ndetailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The DOD adjudicators \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn an unsworn statement, dated July 19, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was initially mailed \nto Applicant on September 12, 2019, and, for unspecified reasons, re-mailed on \nSeptember 20, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within 30 days after receipt of \nthe FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nIn addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October 5, 2019. \nAlthough a response was due by November 4, 2019, as of March 18, 2020, Applicant had \nnot responded to the FORM.  The case was initially assigned to another administrative \njudge on November 22, 2019, but was reassigned to me on March 18, 2020. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq), appearing in extracts \nof 12 U.S. Government publications that were published by the U.S. Department of State, \nthe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, \nas well as two citations to public law. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they \nare easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See \nStein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). In this instance, although \nDepartment Counsel has selected only certain facts appearing in the identified \npublications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the \npublications in their entirety. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the Iraq subsection. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old Iraqi-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, whose parents, \nsiblings, and in-laws are Iraqi citizen-residents. As a linguist, in 2012, Applicant emigrated \nfrom Iraq to the United States under the Special Immigrant Visa for Iraqi Translators \nProgram (SQ1) because he had previously served as a linguist-translator with the U.S. \nArmy in Iraq from February 2005 until November 2011, during a period of increased \nhostilities and military action, and he contributed to the missions of the United States at \npersonal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. He was married in Iraq in 2008, and \nhis wife accompanied him to the United States in 2012. He has not reported any children. \nHe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2017, and although Department Counsel \nindicated that Applicant\u2019s wife was naturalized the following year, there is no evidence in \nthe file to confirm that date. Applicant is considered to be a part-time \u201cprospective\u201d \nemployee of a defense contractor, since March 2018, and he will be serving as a linguist-\ntranslator, to be deployed to Iraq. All of Applicant\u2019s formal education, including \nelementary, high school, and college, was received in Iraq. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Iraq in 2005. However, he has attended classes at a local college in the United \nStates in an effort to obtain a General Educational Development (GED) diploma, but as \nof April 2018, no such diploma had been awarded to him.  He has never served as a \nmember of the U.S. military or of any foreign military. He has never been granted a \nsecurity clearance. He has no financial interests outside of the United States. \n \nForeign Influence \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the foreign influence issues discussed \nbelow can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated March 30, 2018); Item \n2 (Answer to the SOR, dated July 17, 2019); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nApril 20, 2018); Item 4 (Investigative Findings; Counterintelligence Focused Security \nScreening Questionnaire (CIFSSQ); List of Foreign Travel; List of Relatives and \nAssociates (LRA); List of Developed Relatives and Associates; List of Relatives and \nAssociates Military & Government Service (LRAM&GS); and List of Developed Relatives \nand Associates Military & Government Service, all dated August 16, 2018).  \n \nFrom about 1999 until about 2001, Applicant was forced to join the Arab Socialist \nBa'ath Party which was headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq, until 2003, in order to attend \ncollege after graduating from high school. While affiliated, he did not perform any duties, \nhe did not hold any rank, he did not pay any fees, and he did not attend any meetings. \nHis past membership in the Ba'ath Party does not present a counterintelligence (CI) or \nforeign preference (FP) risk according to U.S. counterintelligence authorities. However, \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nbecause Applicant\u2019s National Intelligence Agency Checks (NIAC) were incomplete at the \ntime of his screening in August 2018, and the completed portions contained no derogatory \ninformation, until the checks are completed, there is a potential CI/FP risk. (Item 4 \n(Investigative Findings), at 2-3; Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 5)) \n \nBecause of the draw-down of U.S. Forces in Iraq in 2011, Applicant decided to \nleave Iraq as well because he felt his life would be in danger for supporting those U.S. \nForces as a local-hire linguist for seven years. (Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 1) In 2018, he \ndescribed his feelings for Iraq: \u201cI feel it\u2019s unsafe for everyone, not just ME . . . if it was up \nto ME I wish I can bring all of MY family . . . the safety and environment is very poor. \nSecurity is really bad because it is controlled by Iran. I feel scared for MY family . . . .\u201d \n(Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 3) In 2019, he reaffirmed his desire to bring his entire family to the \nUnited States. (Item 2) \n \nWhen questioned about having any concerns about working for the United States \nin Iraq, and how he would handle those concerns, Applicant replied: \u201cNo . . . if I ever \naccept an offer to go to Iraq I will not let anyone know where I am working . . . I did this \njob before with the U.S. military, I don\u2019t fear anymore.\u201d (Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 8) \n \n \nApplicant continues to be a dual citizen, despite having renounced his allegiance \nto Iraq when he took his oath of U.S. citizenship in 2017. That oath is as follows: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure \nall allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States \nof America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true \nfaith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United \nStates when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service \nin the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I \nwill perform work of national importance under civilian direction when \nrequired by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental \nreservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. \n \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-\nunited-states-america \n \nWhen questioned by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in April 2018, he acknowledged that he maintains dual citizenship, \nand that he had taken no action to renounce it. He explained that his inaction was \nassociated with the fact that his parents and in-laws remain in Iraq, and his family keeps \nhim \u201ctethered\u201d to Iraq. (Item 5, at 1) However, during his August 2018 counterintelligence \ninterview, when asked about having allegiance to any country over the United States, he \ninsisted that \u201c[b]ecause everything changed, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s MY country anymore . . . \ngovernment, politics, and even people.\u201d (Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 1) In his Answer to the SOR, \nhe added: \u201c[M]y allegiance and my family allegiance are to the United States of America \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n. . . My loyalty is only to the United States. I have nothing . . . that will limit my loyalty, \nservice to the United States. . . .\u201d (Item 2) \n \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and in-laws are Iraqi citizen-\nresidents. His mother, a woman in her 70s, is currently a housewife, and she retired as a \nschool librarian a decade ago; his father, also in his 70s, retired as an unarmed school \nsecurity guard a decade ago after being drafted into the Iraqi Army in 1987, and being \nwounded; a brother, in his 40s, is with the Ministry of the Interior as an armed school and \nmosque security officer who has never served in the Iraqi Army; another brother, also in \nhis 40s, is an unarmed school front desk security person who has never served in the \nIraqi Army; his mother-in-law, a woman in her 60s, is currently a housewife, and she \nretired as a school archiver over a decade ago. Except as noted above, parents, siblings, \nand in-laws were never associated with the Iraqi military or intelligence service. As of \nAugust 2018, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family and extended family members varied. \nHe generally spoke to his parents and mother-in-law on a weekly basis, and his two \nbrothers on a monthly basis. He last had contact with his father-in-law over a decade ago. \n(Item 3, at 28-39; Item 5, at 8-10; Item 4 (LRA), at 1-3; Item 4 (LRAM&GS). \n \nIraq \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic in constant turmoil. The outcome of \nthe 2014 parliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair \nelections and led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nuri al-\nMaliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The assessment of subsequent elections has \nnot been reported. On October 2, 2018, Iraqi President Barham Salih selected Adil Abdul-\nMahdi to be the Prime Minister of Iraq, and he was given 30 days to form a new \ngovernment. On October 25, 2018, Abdul-Mahdi was sworn into office, five months after \nthe 2018 elections. However, on November 29, 2019, after weeks of widespread \ndemonstrations against a government that protesters considered corrupt, failing to \nprovide them with basic services, and beholden to powerful neighboring Iran, Mahdi \nresigned his post, and the Iraqi parliament approved his resignation on December 1, \n2019. He was scheduled to continue on in a caretaker role until parliament approved a \nfull-time replacement. On February 1. 2020, Mohammed Tawfik Allawi was nominated to \nserve as Prime Minister of Iraq, but he withdrew his candidacy on March 1, 2020, after \nparliament failed for the second time in a week to approve his cabinet. On March 17, \n2020, Adnan al-Zurfi, a former official of the Iraq Reconstruction and Development \nCouncil (IRDC) that took over Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion that deposed former ruler \nSaddam Hussein, was designated to become Prime Minister, drawing criticism from Iran\u2019s \nallies in the country amid new tensions between Washington and Tehran. \nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait and declared its annexation into \nIraq. Despite United Nations (UN) disapproval of the action, Iraq refused to withdraw from \nKuwait. In January 1991, a coalition of nations, led by the United States, launched military \noperations against Iraq, called Operation Desert Storm. The Iraqi Army was crushed. No-\nfly zones were established in Iraq, banning Iraq from using all aircraft in the designated \nno-fly zones. After several years of Iraqi non-compliance with established UN resolutions \nand requirements, in March 2003, the United States and another coalition of nations \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nlaunched another assault on Iraq, called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some military \noperations ceased in May 2003, and a provisional government under the IRDC and an \nAmerican Chief Civilian Administrator was established to decide all Iraqi affairs. Over the \nensuing years, hostilities and terrorism continued, and U.S. military operations increased. \nIn 2003, outlawed mid-level and lower level officials of the Ba\u2019ath Party were permitted to \nreturn to their previous posts. By late 2010, over 90,000 U.S. troops were withdrawn from \nIraq, leaving only a transitional military force to advise and assist security forces, \ncounterterrorism missions, and protect U.S. civilians. \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked \na milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and \nself-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as well as a voice \nof moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning government \ninstitutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly constructive role in \nthe region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass pre-Saddam \nproduction levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains vigorous and \nbroad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues in \naccordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA). \n  \nThe SFA between Iraq and the U.S. provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral \nrelationship. It covers the range of bilateral issues including political relations and \ndiplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement \nissues, services, science, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the \nSFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination \nCommittees, which meet periodically.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current travel \nadvisory level is Level 4: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.\u201d The \nU.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government \npersonnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict \nsecurity guidelines. On May 15, 2019, the U.S. Department of State ordered the departure \nof non-emergency U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Bagdad and \nthe U.S. Consulate in Erbil amidst heightened tension with Iran. \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in many areas of the country, \nincluding Baghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators \n(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed \non or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire \nweapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and markets. \n  \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL). In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nterrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number \nof foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically \neroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for \nIraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than \n12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from \nISIL, drastically reducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Nevertheless, anti-\nAmerican/anti-western sentiment exists throughout Iraq, especially among Iran-backed \nmilitias. Human rights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of unlawful \nkillings and other abuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular \nMobilization Forces.  \n  \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces \nkilling, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the overwhelming \nmajority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly \nShia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic minorities; \nwomen; and children.  \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due \nto violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking \nin persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and Iraq \ngovernment problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nWhile most of the official U.S. commentary regarding Iraq focuses on human rights \nviolations and terrorist activities, there is little, if any, evidence that Iraq is an active \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nparticipant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violator \nof export-control regulations. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe SOR focused on Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and in-laws, and their Iraqi \ncitizenship and residence. Applicant is bound to his family and extended family in Iraq by \nmutual affection. In addition to the citizenship and residence issues, other facts of \nparticular note in the Government\u2019s argument in the FORM are generally as follows: the \nfrequency of contacts that Applicant has with his family and extended family; the presence \nof Islamist radical groups in Iraq; the increased levels of terrorism, violence, and \ninsurgency in Iraq; significant human rights problems in Iraq; and the current U.S. \nDepartment of State travel advisory level stating: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to terrorism \nand armed conflict.\u201d All of these facts concerning country conditions in Iraq demonstrate \na potentially heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due to \nApplicant\u2019s close ties to family members who reside in Iraq.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d (See Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)) \n \nThere are safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily because of terrorists and \nanti-U.S. sectarian militias operating in Iraq. The mere possession of close family ties with \nrelatives or in-laws living in Iraq is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under the foreign \ninfluence guideline. However, if an applicant has such a relationship with even one person \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of sensitive information. (See \nISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) These \ntypes of relationships could create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. Furthermore, as a matter of common sense and \nhuman experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection \nfor, or obligation to, their immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. (See ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019); ISCR Case No. 09-\n06831 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011); ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, \n2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)) Because of the SOR allegation associated with \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws, the in-law presumption concerning foreign influence is relevant here.  \n  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for foreign influence cases, \u201cthe nature of \nthe foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d (See ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)) Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government \ncoercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Iraq with \nthe United States, and the situation in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationship with any family member living in Iraq does \nnot pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nForeign influence security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the \nUnited States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) Friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity, and we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. (See ISCR Case No. \n02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)). \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nIraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or \nhis family, it would not be wise to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Iraq, like many countries, has a problem with terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the \nattention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to \nexert coercion upon him.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)) \nNevertheless, as noted above, because of the citizenship and residence issues of his \nfamily members; and the other facts of particular note in the Government\u2019s argument, the \nissues of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation have been raised, and AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. However, further inquiry is necessary to determine the degree of \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d as well as the application of any mitigating conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAs noted above, since October 2001, when U.S. forces and coalition partners led \nmilitary operations in Iraq, there has been first an interim government, essentially under \nU.S. control by the Chief Civilian Administrator and the IRDC, and then a democratic \ngovernment in Iraq. Nevertheless, many daunting challenges remain largely because of \nIslamic terrorists and unfriendly forces continue to assert power and intimidation within \nthe country. It is less likely that the Iraqi government would attempt coercive means to \nobtain sensitive information. The real concern in this instance is not the Iraqi government, \nbut rather the Islamic terrorists and anti-U.S. sectarian militias.  \n \nDepartment Counsel argued that the presence of Islamist radical groups; the \nincreased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in \nIraq demonstrate that a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present \ndue to Applicant\u2019s close ties to his parents, siblings, and in-laws. Based on their various \nrelationships, and the locations of Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws, there is obviously a \npotential, if not substantial, risk \u2013 a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security \nclearance.  \n \nHowever, that risk is not generated by the Iraqi government, but rather by Islamic \nterrorists striking out against the central Iraq authorities and all foreigners. Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings and in-laws are not unlike members of the U.S. military stationed in Iraq, for they, \ntoo, are potential targets in this war on civilized humanity. The presence of Islamist radical \ngroups and increased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency in Iraq have also been \ndescribed for events occurring on September 11, 2001, and more recently in Fort Hood, \nBoston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, and New York City.  \n \nThere are U.S. military forces stationed in Iraq, and Applicant\u2019s continued presence \nthere as a linguist assisting the U.S. forces, while faced with the high-risk dangers \ninvolved there, would be of significant assistance to those U.S. forces in fulfilling their \nmission. In ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board \ndiscussed a translator\u2019s multiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time \nas a resident in the United States, and connections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal \nBoard stated: \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n  \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. \nforces is not a factor that weighs against his or her national security \neligibility. On the contrary, such deployments tend to establish various \nmitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of \ninterest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and longstanding \nloyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe \nforeign . . . activities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 \n8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it \nis] unlikely to result in a conflict of interest and could not be used effectively \nto influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d)  \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of \nsecurity clearance). \n \nSuch evidence clearly demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of personal risk on behalf of the United States and shows his ties \nand sense of obligation to the United States could be sufficiently strong enough to support \na favorable application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b). (ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. \nBd. May 24, 2018); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s \nwork in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous high-\nrisk circumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to national security.\u201d) See \nalso ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at \n2-3 (App. Bd.Feb.5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012)) \n   \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and in-laws are or have \never been political activists, challenging the policies of the Iraqi government; that terrorists \nhave approached or threatened them for any reason; that the Iraqi government or any \nterrorist organization have approached them; or that they currently engage in activities \nthat would bring attention to themselves. As such, there is a reduced possibility that they \nwould be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Iraqi government or the terrorists, \nwhich may seek to quiet those who speak out against them. Under these circumstances, \nthe potential heightened risk created by their residence in Iraq is greatly diminished. \nUnder the developed evidence, it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States. \n \nApplicant has substantial connections to the United States, having lived in the \nUnited States for nearly a decade. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the \nUnited States. He served shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. Forces in Iraq as a linguist-\ntranslator from February 2005 until November 2011, during a period of increased \nhostilities and military action, and he contributed to the missions of the United States at \npersonal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. \n \nApplicant has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood that relationships \nwith his parents, siblings, and in-laws could create a risk for foreign influence or \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nexploitation. Furthermore, considering his professional activities as a linguist for U.S. \nForces in Iraq, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast \nand undivided, and that he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).      \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation, because his \nparents, siblings, and in-laws are Iraqi citizen-residents, they are at risk from Islamic \nterrorists and anti-U.S. sectarian militias operating in Iraq. The Iraqi government does not \nfully comply with the rule of law or protect civil liberties in many instances. From about \n1999 until about 2001, Applicant was forced to join the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in order \nto attend college after graduating from high school.  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old Iraqi-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, who emigrated from Iraq to \nthe United States under the Special Immigrant Visa for Iraqi Translators Program.  He is \nconsidered to be a part-time \u201cprospective\u201d employee of a defense contractor, since March \n2018, and he will be serving as a linguist-translator, to be deployed to Iraq. He previously \nserved in the same capacity during a period of increased hostilities and military action, \nand he contributed to the missions of the United States at personal risk on behalf of U.S. \ncombat forces in Iraq. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Iraq in 2005. He has attended \nclasses at a local college in the United States in an effort to obtain a GED diploma, but as \nof April 2018, no such diploma had been awarded to him.  He has never served as a \nmember of the Iraqi military. He has no financial interests outside of the United States. \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nHis past membership in the Ba'ath Party does not present a CI or FP risk according to \nU.S. counterintelligence authorities. \nDespite differences exacerbated by Iran, the United States and Iraqi governments \nare allies in the war on terrorism. Applicant has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity \nto the United States. His past honorable service as a linguist weighs heavily towards \nmitigating the foreign influence security concerns. These circumstances increase the \nprobability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. As he clearly stated, \u201cI \ndid this job before with the U.S. military, I don\u2019t fear anymore.\u201d  (See ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008))  \n \nAlthough there is a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of terrorist activities occurring in Iraq, such \nactivities are also active in the United States, creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201d here as well. \nWith his wife residing in the United States, there is a reduced \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Under the evidence \npresented, I have no questions about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 6, 2018. \nOn September 3, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 4, 2019, and initially requested an \nadministrative determination. He then retained counsel, and on December 12, 2019, he \namended his response and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On \nDecember 9, 2019, Department Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 1.b to correctly allege \nApplicant\u2019s siblings in Sudan. Applicant admitted the amended allegation at the hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 8, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 9, 2020, scheduling the hearing \nfor February 11, 2020. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s Request for \nAdministrative Notice for the Republic of the Sudan and discovery letter, were appended \nto the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II, respectively. I admitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through T, which I admitted in evidence without objection. The \nrecord was held open pending additional documents to be submitted by February 21, \n2020. Those additional documents were submitted by Applicant within the appropriate \ntime, marked collectively as AE U, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 24, 2020. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Republic of the Sudan was included in the record as HE I. Applicant did not \nobject. I have taken administrative notice of facts contained in HE I, updated and \nsupplemented with publicly available documents, and summarized below. \n \nRepublic of the Sudan \n \nSudan established independence from joint administrative rule by Egypt and the \nUnited Kingdom in 1956. In 1993, the United States designated Sudan a State sponsor \nof terrorism after the Sudanese government established links with international terrorist \norganizations. Sudan has harbored elements of the most violent terrorist organizations in \nthe world including; Hamas; Abu Nidal Organization; Palestinian Islamic Jihad; and \nLebanese Hizballah. U.S. courts have established that the Sudanese government was \nresponsible for the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole (DDG 67), and materially \nfinanced the al Qaeda terrorists responsible for bombing the U.S. embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania on August 1998. \n \nThe United States and Sudan entered into a bilateral dialogue on counterterrorism \nin May 2000. Sudan has provided concrete cooperation against international terrorism \nsince the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. However, although Sudan \npublicly supported the international coalition actions against the al Qaida network and the \nTaliban in Afghanistan, the government criticized the U.S. strikes in that country, and \nopposed a widening of the effort against international terrorism to other countries. Sudan \nremains on the state sponsors of terrorism list. \n\n \n3 \n \nIn April 2019, the Sudanese army announced the overthrow of the government of \nPresident Bashir, and the establishment of a transitional military counsel. Previously, \nSudan was a republic with power concentrated in the hands of authoritarian President \nBashir and the National Congress Party, which had maintained nearly absolute political \nauthority in Sudan. In August 2019, the ruling military council and civilian opposition \nalliance signed a power-sharing deal as the \"Sovereignty Council,\" a joint civilian-military-\nexecutive body consisting of six civilians and five generals. The Council is led by the \nmilitary, but is intended to transition to civilian leadership in May 2021 after elections. \nGeneral Burhan serves as both chief of state and head of government.  \n \nThe United States acknowledged the ouster of Bashir and his regime. On August \n21, 2019, a former United Nations economist, Abdalla Hamdok, was designated Prime \nMinister. The U.S. Department of State noted this created the opportunity to forge a new \npolitical order and social contract in Sudan. Prime Minister Hamdok and the civilian-led \ntransitional government were commended for representing civil society, efforts to deliver \npeace, justice, freedoms, equality, and respect for human rights to the Sudanese people. \nAdditionally, the new government has promised to compensate the victims of \nthe embassy bombings and the attack on USS Cole. In March 2020, Hamdok survived \nan assassination attempt in Khartoum. \n \nSignificant human rights issues under the former Bashir government included: \nunlawful or arbitrary killings; forced disappearance; torture; and arbitrary detention, all by \nsecurity forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arrests \nand intimidation of journalists, censorship, newspaper seizures, and site blocking; \nsubstantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, \nsuch as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization laws; restrictions on religious \nliberty; restrictions on political participation; widespread corruption; lack of accountability \nin cases involving violence against women; trafficking in persons; outlawing of \nindependent trade unions; and child labor. Respect for human rights, in particular \nfundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, and religion, greatly improved after the \ncivilian-led transitional government took power.  \n \nIn Darfur and the Two Areas, paramilitary forces and rebel groups continued to \ncommit killings, rape, and torture of civilians throughout the year. Local militias maintained \nsubstantial influence due to widespread impunity. There were reports of both pro-\ngovernment and anti-government militias looting, raping, and killing civilians. \nIntercommunal violence spawned from land tenure disputes and resource scarcity \ncontinued to result in civilian deaths, particularly in East, South, and North Darfur. \n \nFollowing Bashir\u2019s fall, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) initially refrained \nfrom attacks on peaceful protesters. However, on April 11, 2019, a U.S. travel advisory \nwas issued to refrain from travel to Sudan due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, \nand armed conflict, and non-emergency U.S. government employees were ordered to \ndepart from Sudan. On June 3, 2019, security forces dispersed the two-month-long sit-in \nof tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum. In addition to excessive use \nof force, there were reports of widespread rapes as well as reports of numerous protesters \nbeing thrown into the Nile River alive and left to drown. The TMC reported 87 dead and \n\n \n4 \n \n168 wounded, while most civilian groups tallied almost 130 dead and 700 wounded. At \nthe time, the U.S. Embassy advised American personnel to shelter in place at home. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges Applicant\u2019s three sisters, brother, half-brother, half-\nsister, and mother-in-law are residents and citizens of Sudan. It also alleges three \ndelinquent debts totaling $19,897, including a line of credit, a personal loan, and a credit \ncard debt. Applicant admitted the Guideline B allegations and denied the Guideline F \nallegations, with comments and explanations. \n \nApplicant is 64 years old. He was born in Sudan, entered the United States in 2000, \nand naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2008. He married in 1984. His spouse was born in \nSudan, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. They have four adult children, all \nof whom live in the United States. His two daughters are U.S. citizens, and his two sons \nare permanent U.S. residents. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981, and has \nbeen employed as a linguist for a government contractor since March 2019. He primarily \nworks for the U.S. Army in Iraq. He drives a taxi when between contracting jobs. He has \nnever held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant has three sisters that are citizens and residents of Sudan between the \nages of 75 and 85. He testified that they are not educated and suffer from bad health. He \nspeaks to them about once or twice per year. Applicant\u2019s brother is a resident and citizen \nof Sudan. He does not know what his brother does for a living, and last spoke to him \nabout eight months ago. Applicant reported in his 2018 counterintelligence screening that \nhis brother was unemployed. Applicant also has a half-brother and half-sister that are \ncitizens and residents of Sudan. He spoke to them about eight months ago, and his half-\nbrother is sick and bedridden. Applicant last saw them in 2015 when he visited Sudan. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Sudan. She is 85 years old, and is \nalso bedridden with heart problems. Her children care of her. Applicant\u2019s spouse has \ncontact with her mother over social media, and speaks to her about every six months to \na year. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have ties to the Sudanese government. Once \nApplicant applied for a security clearance, he reduced contact with his family in Sudan, \nand he does not have property or financial interests in Sudan. \n \nApplicant moved to the United States for a better life for his family, and education \nfor his children. He supported his children\u2019s education while driving a taxi from 2003 to \n2017. In 2017, he was unemployed for about four months while undergoing eye and neck \nsurgery, and remained underemployed as the taxi business was overcome by ride-\nsharing services. Applicant stated that he loves the United States, and his immediate \nfamily live in the United States. His children\u2019s education and occupations include medical \ndoctor, chemist, nurse, and human resource specialist. He is a loyal U.S. citizen, and \nconsiders the United States his home. \n \nApplicant incurred three debts as a result of medical procedures, unemployment, \nand underemployment. He fell behind on debts when he lost income after being unable \nto drive a taxi after his surgeries, and with the decline of the taxi business. He hired a \n\n \n5 \n \ndebt relief company in 2017, received financial counseling, and resolved the debts. One \ndebt was settled and paid on a payment plan as a result of litigation, and two others were \npaid in September and November 2019. Applicant owns a home and is current on his \nmortgage and expenses. He earns about $80,000 per year, and his spouse earns about \n$21,600 per year. His February 2020 personal financial statement shows a monthly net \nremainder of $3,114. He has bank savings valued at about $15,000. \n \nPolicies \n \n \u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed  \n \n\n \n6 \n \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, \na family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country \nis known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the \nnature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist \n\n \n7 \n \nactivity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not \nconsider terrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s three sisters, brother, half-brother, half-sister, and mother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Sudan. Sudan is a country undergoing political change, but with \na history of support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and authoritarian governments. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nApplicant was born in Sudan. He entered the United States in 2000 and naturalized \nas a U.S. citizen in 2008. His spouse was born in Sudan, and naturalized as a U.S. citizen \nin 2010. They have four adult children, all of whom live in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nthree sisters in Sudan are elderly, not educated, and suffer from bad health. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother in Sudan is relatively estranged from Applicant except for rare contact. Applicant \nhas occasional contact with his half-brother and half-sister in Sudan. Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law in Sudan is elderly and in poor health. Applicant\u2019s spouse has contact with her over \nsocial media, and speaks to her about every six months to a year. Applicant has \noccasional but not frequent contact with his family members in Sudan, and has limited his \ncontact once he realized the security concerns raised by it. None of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers have ties to the Sudanese government, and he does not have property or \nfinancial interests in Sudan.  \n \nApplicant has served as a contract linguist in support of the U.S. Army in Iraq. He \nhas lived and worked in the United States for 20 years. He raised a family of educated \nand successful children, and owns a home in the United States. His citizenship, loyalty, \n\n \n8 \n \nfinancial interests, and significant close family ties are in the United States. He has \nminimal contact with relatives in Sudan, and considers the United States his home. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred several delinquent debts beginning in 2017 due to medical \nneeds, unemployment, and underemployment. The record evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant supported his children\u2019s education while driving a taxi from 2003 to 2017. \nIn 2017, he was unemployed for about four months while undergoing eye and neck \nsurgery, and remained underemployed as the taxi business was overcome by ride-\nsharing services. He resolved his debts through diligent work and tenacious efforts. He \nobtained counseling and the services of a credit repair company, and resolved his debts. \nHe has a solid personal balance sheet, and a substantial monthly net income remaining \nafter paying expenses. I believe Applicant has overcome his financial problems and \nadditional delinquencies are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security \nconcerns. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nGregg A.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \nimplemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \n \nWith an undated letter, Applicant answered (Ans.) the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On January 27, 2020, the case was assigned to \nme. On January 29, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 5, 2020. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 13, 2020. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports. (See \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d \nCir. 1986); Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1987. He immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2009, using a special immigrant visa earned as a result of his work as a \nlinguist for U.S. forces in Iraq from 2006-2009. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. He \nearned an associate\u2019s degree. He is single and has no children. Applicant is seeking a \nlinguist position, which requires a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 20-21, 24; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s father, mother, three brothers, two sisters, and \nhis stepmother are residents and citizens of Iraq. It also alleged that his cousin, who is a \nKurdish soldier, and his brother-in-law, who is a police officer for the Ministry of Interior, \nare also residents and citizens of Iraq. Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nprovided financial support to various family members, friends, and contacts in Iraq.  \n \n \nIn 2006, after Applicant graduated from high school in Iraq, he was hired as a \nlinguist to work with U.S. forces. Performing his linguist duties placed him in harm\u2019s way \non numerous occasions. Three U.S. Army officers he served with provided letters of \nrecommendations, which described Applicant\u2019s duties performed and his character \ntraits. (Tr. 20, 38; AE A-C) A former Army officer described Applicant as having \n\u201cunquestionable integrity and sheer dedication.\u201d He went on to state: \n\n \n3 \n \n \nI have prioritized maintaining contact with [Applicant] over the years, \nbecause his character and integrity are simply beyond reproach. My trust \nand faith in [Applicant\u2019s] patriotism has only strengthened over the years. I \ncannot imagine he has not faced hardship and struggle, leaving his family \nand coming to the United States. But every time we talk, [Applicant] has \nalways expressed incredible gratitude to be in this country and an \nunwavering pride to be an American. The fact that he is seeking this \nsecret clearance so that he can continue to serve this country in a critically \nimportant role as a translator underscores [Applicant\u2019s] patriotism and \ndedication to our country (AE A) \n \nAnother Army officer who served with Applicant stated the following:  \n \n[Applicant] is dependable, hardworking, and punctual. He is able to form \nrelationships with locals that facilitate our later engagements. [Applicant] \nhas proved to be loyal, trustworthy, and has become a good friend. \n \nI commend [Applicant\u2019s] performance and recommend [Applicant] without \nreservation for employment or citizenship. He has fought and suffered with \nmy soldiers and done more than many Americans who decided to sit this \nwar out. The courage he has shown and dedication to improving the lives \nof Iraqis is commendable and should be rewarded. (AE B)  \n \nThe third Army officer supporting Applicant noted that Applicant\u2019s actions in Iraq \ncontributed to the safety of his soldiers and Iraqi citizens. (AE C) \n \n \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s father and stepmother (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e). Applicant has no ongoing \nrelationship with his father and stepmother who are citizens and reside in Iraq. He has \nnever met or spoken to his stepmother and his last contact with his father was in 2007. \nHis estrangement is due to his father abandoning their family years ago. (Tr. 25) \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant\u2019s mother is a resident and citizen of \nIraq. She is 68 years old. She resides in a refugee camp in the Kurdish area of Iraq. \nShe does not work outside the home and has no affiliation with the Iraqi government. \nApplicant maintains weekly telephone contact with his mother. He has provided financial \nassistance to his mother at various times in order to overcome the loss of all family \npossessions when she fled from hostile occupiers and entered a refugee camp. Most \nrecently, he sent her $800 two months ago. He estimated that over the years he may \nhave provided approximately $30,000 to various family members in Iraq. (Tr. 21, 26, 32-\n34, 39-40; GE 3) \n  \n \n \n3. Applicant\u2019s three brothers (B1, B2, B3) (SOR \u00b6 1.c). All Applicant\u2019s brothers \nremain citizens of Iraq, but B1 and B2 currently reside in France. Both recently moved \nto France and are seeking employment there. They do not intend to return to Iraq. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has weekly telephone contact with B1 and B2. B3 has resided in Germany for \napproximately four months. He does not intend to return to Iraq. Applicant has weekly \ntelephone contact with B3. He has provided financial assistance to his brothers at \nvarious times in order to overcome the loss of all family possessions when they fled \nfrom hostile occupiers and entered a refugee camp. (Tr. 21, 26-29, 32-34, 40; GE 3) \n \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s two sisters and a brother-in-law (S1, S2, BL (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f). S1 \nand BL (S1\u2019s husband) are residents and citizens of Iraq. S1 does not work outside the \nhome and BL is a police officer for the Ministry of the Interior. Applicant has weekly \ntelephone contact with S1 and monthly contact with BL. S2 remains a citizen of Iraq, but \nshe currently resides in France where she attends school. She does not intend to return \nto Iraq. Applicant has had weekly contact with S2 in the past. She has no affiliation with \nthe Iraqi government. (Tr. 21, 26, 30-34, 41; GE 3) \n \n \n5. Applicant\u2019s cousin (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant\u2019s cousin is a resident and citizen of \nIraq. He is currently a member of the Kurdish military. Applicant has contact with this \ncousin approximately two times a year. (Tr. 32, 41-42; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant maintains checking and savings accounts in a U.S. bank. Currently \nbetween both accounts, he has approximately $10,000. He has no property or other \nassets in Iraq and he does not stand to inherent any property. He returned to Iraq in \n2015 for approximately 40 days to visit his family. He would protect the interests of the \nUnited States over concerns about his Iraqi family\u2019s safety. He intends to reside in the \nUnited States in the future and has no desire or intent to reside in Iraq. (Tr. 34-37) \n \nAdministrative Notice. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. In May \n2019, the U.S. government considered the potential threat to U.S. government \npersonnel in Iraq to be serious enough to order the departure of non-emergency \nemployees from the embassy and consulate. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) \nremained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and \nSyria. Human rights abuses in Iraq include unlawful killings and other serious crimes by \nIraqi security forces. (HE II) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \n\n \n6 \n \n \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives living in Iraq do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be \nplaced in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and a desire to assist his relatives living in Iraq who might be coerced by \ngovernmental entities or terrorist organizations, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and citizens of \nIraq.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.     \nApplicant credibly testified that he has weekly contact with his mother, but \nminimal contact with S2, BL, and his cousin who remain in Iraq. He presented sufficient \nevidence to establish that it is unlikely that he would be placed in a position to choose \nbetween the interests of his relatives living in Iraq and those of the United States. He \nalready has demonstrated that he would put the United States\u2019 interests first when he \nworked as a linguist for U.S. forces. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. He currently \nworks and lives in the United States. He worked as a linguist in Iraq from 2006 to 2009. \nHe performed missions for U.S. forces where he earned praise for his service while in \nharm\u2019s way. He performed his linguistic duties for U.S. military officers who recommend \nhim. The evidence supports that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States \nand would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) \napplies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the comments by Applicant\u2019s U.S. military \nsupervisors, who attested to his dedication and commitment to U.S. forces. I also \nconsidered his ties to this country. He has demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the \nUnited States. Therefore, he provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Although Applicant mitigated the \npersonal conduct concerns alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), she failed to \nmitigate the concerns raised by her history of ongoing financial problems and \nunresolved delinquent debts. Her request for eligibility to occupy a position of trust is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 21, 2019, the DOD issued a SOR detailing security concerns under the \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Review Program (Jan. \n2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant public trust eligibility. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. The \nGovernment submitted its written case on October 7, 2019. A complete copy of the file \n\n \n2 \n \nof relevant material (FORM) along with 11 attachments, and a copy the Directive were \nprovided to Applicant. She received the FORM on November 19, 2019. In response, \nApplicant submitted six documents. Department Counsel objected to the submissions, \nbut did not provide a basis for the objection. The attachments to the FORM are admitted \nto the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, without objection. Applicant\u2019s \ndocuments are admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F, over Department \nCounsel\u2019s unspecified objection.  \n \nEvidentiary Matters \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has two delinquent student loans with the \nDepartment of Education. In her October 2017 security application, Applicant disclosed \ntaking online classes at a for-profit university. The university ceased operations in \nMarch 2016 after having its accreditation withdrawn by the Accrediting Council for \nIndependent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). Information about the school closure and \nits effect on Applicant\u2019s student loan repayment obligations are necessary to consider in \nthis case; however, neither party offered any evidence on the issue. Accordingly, I have \nconsidered information from the following sources:  \n \nhttp://www.westwood.edu/; \n \nhttp://www.westwood.edu/Westwood_Acknowledgement_of_Campus_Clo\nsures.pdf; and \n \nhttps://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/closed-\nschool#criteria. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 31, has worked for her employer, a federal contracting company \nresponsible for administering medical benefits and claims for the TRICARE Program, \nsince September 2017. Her position requires access to personally identifiable \ninformation. (GE 4) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2017. She did \nnot disclose any derogatory information in response to questions seeking information \nabout her criminal history in the seven years preceding the application. The \ninvestigation revealed that a criminal complaint was filed against Applicant in May 2016. \nBased on this information, the SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthat she was \u201carrested/charged with misdemeanor assault and battery on about May 31, \n2016.\u201d Applicant maintains that she was never arrested and that she never appeared in \ncourt to answer the charges. She spoke to a defense attorney who contacted her about \nthe case and explained the events leading up to the criminal complaint. The court \nrecord supports Applicant\u2019s story. According to the GE 11, a case detail record, an \nindividual filed a criminal complaint against Applicant on May 31, 2016, almost two \nmonths after the alleged incident date. The record indicates that Applicant was \n\u201creleased on summons,\u201d indicating that she had notice of the criminal complaint and the \n\n \n3 \n \npotential criminal charges. The record also indicates that an arraignment hearing was \nscheduled in June 2016, but that it was continued without explanation. The court \ndismissed the criminal complaint with prejudice at the second hearing in July 2016 \neither on its own volition or by motion of the prosecutor. The record indicates that \nApplicant was never arrested or formally charged with any crime. (GE 3-4, 11; AE A) \n \n In response to the financial history questions on the October 2017 security \nclearance application, Applicant disclosed two delinquent accounts: a $600 judgment \nshe resolved in March 2017; and a utility account she believed was opened fraudulently \nin her name. However, the background investigation revealed numerous delinquent \naccounts. During a March 2018 background interview, Applicant volunteered \ninformation about two additional delinquent accounts: a March 2017 car repossession \n(1.d, $2,818) and a medical debt collection in the summer of 2017 for approximately \n$400. The investigator then confronted Applicant with evidence of 26 delinquent \naccounts, including seven judgments, another vehicle repossession ($1.n, $26,195), \nand two student loan accounts (1.v and 1.w, totaling $15,161). According to the \ninterview summary, Applicant told the investigator that she recognized some of the \naccounts, but could not provide the investigator with additional information about them. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $56,700 for 23 accounts and that she \ndeliberately failed to disclose a judgment and 16 accounts that were delinquent at the \ntime she completed the September 2017 security clearance application. In her answer \nto the SOR, Applicant admits the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e \u2013 1.i, 1.k \u2013 1.l, and \n1.n \u2013 1.w, and denies the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.c, 1.j, and 1.m. She provided \nqualified admissions to falsification allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (deliberate failure to \ndisclose judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2.c (deliberate failure to disclose 16 \ndelinquent accounts). (GE 3-5, 7-10) \n \n \nApplicant states that her financial problems began in 2011 when she \nunexpectedly moved to her home state to care for her now-deceased younger brother. \nShe attributes SOR \u00b6 1.u ($484) to this time. She also blames the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.n, 1.o 1.q, and 1.r, totaling approximately $29,900, on the dissolution \nof her marriage. Applicant and her husband are separated. The record does not specify \nhow long the couple has been separated or provide any information about the financial \nterms of the separation. Applicant admits that she and her husband purchased the car \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($26,195) together, but that he retained the car after their \nseparation. Applicant stated in her interview that she did not know when the car loan \nbecame delinquent. It is unclear if she was aware of the repossession before the \nbackground interview. Applicant states that she is financially responsible for her two \nchildren, ages 11 and 13. It is unclear if Applicant receives any child support from her \nestranged husband. Of the 23 debts alleged, 5 debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l) \ntotaling approximately $1,100 became delinquent after she completed her September \n2017 security clearance application. (GE 3, 5; AE A) \n \nApplicant claims that she is no longer responsible for the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($3,433), 1.r ($280), and 1.v ($9,925), and 1.w ($5,236). According to Applicant, \nan unspecified court ordered her former employer to pay the judgment alleged in SOR \n1.a after the employer failed to garnish her wages in violation of a previous court order. \n\n \n4 \n \nShe claims that she is no longer responsible for the student loan debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.w because they were resolved as part of a lawsuit against the school. \nBetween April and June 2009, Applicant attended a for-profit college that ceased \noperations in 2016 after losing its accreditation. As a result of the closure, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, servicer of the alleged student loans, provided for student \nloan relief to former students who met the criteria of its loan discharge program. \nHowever, Applicant did not provide evidence that she qualified for the program, the \ncriteria of which goes beyond mere enrollment in the now-defunct school, or that she \napplied for relief. Applicant also claims that she is not responsible for the utility account \ndebt alleged in SOR 1.i ($321), claiming a family member opened the account in her \nname without her permission. However, she did not provide any documentation showing \nthat she has disputed this account with the creditor. (GE 3; AE A) \n \nApplicant claims to have resolved the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b61.b ($749). \nAlthough she provided copies of two money order receipts showing $400 payments, the \nreceipts do not establish the payee. Applicant did not offer any documentation regarding \nthe other debts alleged in the SOR and they remain unresolved. (AE A \u2013 B) \n \nApplicant does not believe that she is financially unstable. She acknowledges \nthat she has delinquent debt, but is trying to resolve it \u201cthe right way.\u201d She is considering \nfiling for bankruptcy protection, but did not provide a plan for resolving her delinquent \naccounts. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $56,000 in unresolved delinquent \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s admissions as well as the credit reports and court documents in the \nrecord support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not \nmeeting her financial obligations and an inability to repay her creditors. Financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions 19(a) and (c) apply. Applicant did not present \nsufficient documentation to mitigate the concerns. While providing care for her ailing \nbrother and the dissolution of her marriage may have contributed to her financial \nproblems, Applicant has not established that she has acted responsibly in light of her \ncircumstances. Her finances are not under control. She accumulated at least $1,100 in \nadditional delinquent debt after completing her October 2017 security clearance \napplication. Applicant did not present any evidence to show a good-faith effort to resolve \nher delinquent accounts, nor does she have plans for doing so. While Applicant may \nhave established a legitimate basis for disputing the utility account in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the \nstudent loan accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.w, she failed to provide documentation \nshowing that the she has taken action to resolve the issues. Accordingly, none of the \nfinancial considerations mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified her October 2017 security \nclearance application by deliberately failing to disclose a 2016 misdemeanor assault \nand battery charge, a 2013 judgment for $3,433, and the existence of 16 delinquent \naccounts. Conduct involving a lack of candor or dishonesty, particularly, a failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security process, raises questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n(AG \u00b6 15) Generally, evidence of omission alone is not sufficient to establish intentional \nfalsification.  Here, the record does not contain sufficient direct or circumstantial \nevidence of her intent to falsify her security clearance application. The record does not \nestablish that Applicant was ever arrested or charged with a criminal offense, only that \nshe was the subject of a criminal complaint that was ultimately dismissed. Therefore, \nshe was under no obligation to report it on the security clearance application. Also, the \nrecord does not establish that Applicant was aware of the status of the delinquent debts \n\n \n6 \n \nalleged in the SOR when she completed the security clearance application. While \nApplicant had an obligation to ensure her security clearance application contained full \nand complete disclosures, her failure to do so constitutes negligence. Her negligence is \nnot evidence of her intent to deceive the government. Accordingly, the personal conduct \nallegations are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n  \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a \nposition of trust. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person \nfactors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet her burdens of production and persuasion \nto refute or mitigate the financial concerns raised in the SOR. She did not provide any \nevidence to show financial rehabilitation, reform, or that her finances are otherwise \nunder control.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nto occupy a position of trust is denied.                                                                                            \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on \ninformation available to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. The Department \nof Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nDecember 18, 2019, scheduling the hearing for January 10, 2020. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted into the record without objection.  \nApplicant testified in her own behalf and submitted three documents, which were marked  \nas (AE) A-C and admitted into the record. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open \n\n \n2 \n \nuntil January 24, 2020 for additional information. Applicant submitted five exhibits, which \nI marked as AE D-H. There was no objection to the documents. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on January 21, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 32, is single and has two children. She obtained her high school \ndiploma in 2005 and has attended some college classes. Applicant completed her \nsecurity clearance application on March 13, 2017. She has held a security clearance for \nabout 12 years. Applicant was unemployed for 10 months beginning in October 2017. \nShe has been employed with her current employer for one year as a staff assistant. \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate amount of \n$8,752. The debts include various collection accounts. It further alleges that Applicant \nfailed to timely file her Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2011 through \n2017. The SOR alleges a 2014 judgment in the amount of $312, a February 2017  \njudgment in the amount of $449, and a 2018 judgment in the amount of $703. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations. She provided explanations for each allegation. \n \nApplicant acknowledged her debts, and that she has not filed her Federal and state \nincome tax returns timely but stated that the father of her children left her and she had in- \nsufficient income to pay her bills. She stated that she has been on her own since about \n2006. (Tr. 32) She receives no child support. She admitted that it is her fault that she did \nnot file her income taxes. (Tr. 48) However, she stated that her finances do not define her \nas a person. She strongly believes that she deserves to keep her security clearance. \n \nApplicant stated that as to SOR allegation 1.a, she is now working with tax \npreparers so that she can file her Federal income tax returns from 2011 through 2017. \nShe believed that she could apply for a forgiveness program or file all of them at the same \ntime. (Tr.18) She is in the process of doing this, because initially she did not know with \nwhich state she should file. (Tr. 23) She presented no explanation about why she did not \nfile the Federal tax returns. \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant is also working with tax preparers so that she can file her \nstate income tax returns from 2011 through 2017. She has called the state and was told \nthat she could not set up a payment plan at this time.  \n \nAs to 1.c, the 2014 state judgment in the amount of $312, the amount is still owing. \n \nAs to 1.d, the 2017 state judgment in the amount of $449, Applicant has not paid \nthe judgment. \n \nAs to 1.e, the 2018 state judgment in the amount of $703, Applicant still owes this \namount. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAs to 1.f, the collection account in the amount of $5,452, Applicant called to make \npayment arrangements in three installments. She has not started the payment plan yet. \nThis was an apartment that she vacated. (Tr. 31) \n \nAs to 1.g, the cable account in the amount of $368, this account is paid in full and \nApplicant provided documentation to support this claim. (AX A) \n \nAs to 1.h, a collection account in the amount of $1,468, Applicant stated this is the \nresult of a car note that ended in a judgment. It has not been paid. \n \n Applicant\u2019s 2017 investigative interview revealed that she has paid other non-SOR \ndebts during the past year. As to Navient, she stated that her student loans are current. \n(AX B)  These accounts do not appear on the SOR. (GX 7) \n \nApplicant submitted a budget in her post-hearing submissions. She earns about \n$80,000 a year and has a net monthly income of $4,937. (AX D) She has a monthly net \nremainder of about $613. She provided information verifying her full-time employment \nand the fact that she will be getting a raise soon. (AX E-F) Applicant has not had any \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 42) She has no savings. She is doing hair as a hobby and hopes \nto earn some money from that endeavor to add to her income. \n \nApplicant also submitted letters of recommendation from her employer. She is \ndescribed as a dedicated and motivated person who is a delight to work with. She goes \nabove and beyond, is a self-starter, and is administratively saavy. Her character and \npersonal integrity are above approach. (AX G-H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state or local income tax as required\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are long-standing, and she acknowledges that she \nhas not resolved them. She recently paid one bill. She also learned of the accounts in her \n2017 OPM interview. Applicant stated that she paid a few of them, but provided no \ndocumentation. Thus, from the record, it cannot be determined if she applied any good-\nfaith efforts until last year. She also has not filed her Federal and state income tax returns \nfor a number of years and is just now getting a preparer to help her file. She has not \nreceived financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nremain unresolved. Although she promises to address them and states that she does not \nowe that much in delinquent debt, the accounts are not resolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s unemployment of ten months in \n2017 was beyond her control, she has not acted responsibly to address the resulting \ndebts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling; nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control.  Her \ncurrent ability to pay her delinquent debts is in doubt even though she stated that she is \nnot to be defined by her finances. She has not filed her income tax returns for many years, \n\n \n6 \n \nwith no explanation, and is just now beginning to address the issues. Her financial \nproblems are not under control.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f and 1.h against Applicant. I find \nfor Applicant regarding 1.g \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s work career and recommendations, I conclude \nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial \nindebtedness and failure to file her Federal and state income tax returns from 2011 \nthrough 2017. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

McCormack, Esq. \n01/10/2020 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct) and K (Handling Protected Information). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 4, 2016. On June \n10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines E \nand K. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 13, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on October 15, 2019. On October 24, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for November 14, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in \nhis answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old work-control analyst and test director employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 2016. He married in June 1998 and has two children, \nages 16 and 14. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 1998, rose to the rate of \nmachinist\u2019s mate chief (pay grade E-7), and was discharged with a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions in February 2016. (GX 4.) He held a clearance until it was \nsuspended in March 2014. He does not have an active clearance.  \n \n \nIn 1998, while Applicant was assigned to nuclear \u201cA\u201d school, he received \nnonjudicial punishment for falsifying a study log for a friend to cover up the fact that the \nfriend missed two hours of study time. (GX 2 at 7.) Applicant was punished with 30 days \nin correctional custody, after which he was allowed to resume his nuclear training. (Tr. \n60.) This incident was not alleged in the SOR, but Department Counsel submitted the \nevidence in an effort to show a pattern of dishonest conduct. \n \n \nIn August 2012, Applicant was assigned to instructor duty at a nuclear submarine \ntraining command. His assignment required that he pass the engineering watch \nsupervisor (EWS) examination. The command had two moored nuclear submarines that \nhad been converted into training facilities. Part of the training for new instructors was to \nhave on-the-job training by standing watch on one of the moored nuclear submarines. \n(Tr. 27.) However, when Applicant arrived at the training command, both of the \nconverted submarines were undergoing repairs and could not be used for on-the-job \ntraining. (Tr. 27-28.)  \n \nIn early December 2012, Applicant was notified that he was scheduled to take \nthe EWS examination later in the month. He did not believe he was ready for the \nexamination, and he asked for an extension, which was denied. (Tr. 28-30.) He was \nconcerned about his lack of on-the-job training. He was informed by a fellow chief petty \nofficer that the examination was very difficult to pass and that there was a study guide \nfor the examination called the \u201cpencil box.\u201d The fellow chief petty officer told Applicant \nwho could provide the \u201cpencil box\u201d and how many \u201cpencils\u201d he would need for his \nexamination. (Tr. 28-31.) The \u201cpencil box\u201d consisted of unauthorized electronic copies of \nclassified examinations and answer keys. There were five master EWS examinations, \ngiven on a rotating basis every other week. The examinations were largely unchanged \nsince 2004 except for minor revisions to reflect changes in operating procedures or \n\n \n3 \n \nexisting equipment. The original copies of the examinations and answer keys contained \nclassified information, but the \u201cpencil\u201d versions did not have classification markings. \nThey were passed around via unclassified personal email accounts, compact discs, \nthumb drives, and other non-secure means. Before taking the EWS examination, sailors \nwere told which version of the examination they would be taking and received the \ncorresponding \u201cpencil.\u201d (GX 6 at 3.) \n \nApplicant testified that the \u201cpencils\u201d were sent to his personal email account, \nbecause he knew that his receipt of the \u201cpencils\u201d before taking the examination was not \npermitted. (Tr. 68.) He kept the materials in his barracks room without properly \nsafeguarding them until he took the examination, and then he burned them. He admitted \nat the hearing that he knew he should report the ongoing cheating scheme, but he did \nnot want to be \u201cthe person to ruin people\u2019s careers.\u201d (Tr. 73.) He took the examination \nand passed it. (GX 2 at 6.)  \n \n \nIn February 2014, the Navy conducted an investigation into reports of \nwidespread cheating on the EWS examination for enlisted sailors assigned to nuclear \nsubmarines. The investigator concluded that the cheating began at some time before \n2007. The investigator recommended \u201cdisciplinary and administrative action\u201d for 25 \nsailors who provided the \u201cpencil files\u201d to others, 13 sailors who cheated on their own \nEWS examinations, and 3 sailors who told others where to obtain the \u201cpencil files.\u201d (GX \n6 at 18.) The names of the participants in the cheating scheme were redacted in the \ncopy of the report of investigation submitted in evidence (GX 6 at 8-10). Hence, the \nrecord does not reflect whether Applicant was identified by the investigating officer as \none of the participants. \n \nShortly after the investigation of the EWS examination cheating was completed, \nApplicant was on liberty when his master chief contacted him and told him that \neveryone who was engineering watch qualified was required to return to the command \nfor an \u201call chiefs\u201d meeting. Shortly afterwards, a friend texted Applicant and alerted him \nto a television broadcast about the EWS examination being compromised. Applicant \nreported early for the \u201call chiefs\u201d meeting and self-reported his involvement in the \ncheating to his master chief. When he self-reported, he did not know whether he had \nbeen identified as one of the cheaters. (Tr. 33-35; GX 2 at 6.) The evidence indicates \nthat Applicant had not seen the report of investigation when he told his master chief that \nhe was part of the problem, that he was embarrassed, and that he wanted to be part of \nthe solution. (Tr. 35.) \n \n \nIn March 2014, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment from his commander, \na Navy admiral, for three violations of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892: (1) dereliction of duty by failing to safeguard classified \ninformation by wrongfully downloading it onto his unclassified personal computer and \nprinting it on an unclassified printer; (2) failing to obey a general order by failing to notify \nhis security manager or commanding officer upon discovery of classified information \nbeing lost or compromised; and (3) dereliction of duty by cheating on his EWS \nexamination. At the hearing, he testified that he pleaded guilty to all three offenses \n\n \n4 \n \nbecause he knew he was guilty. (Tr. 36-37.) His punishment was forfeiture of half of his \nbasic pay for two months. (GX 3.) Applicant testified that he did not exercise his right to \nrequest trial by court-martial, because he believed he was wrong and needed to accept \nhis punishment. (Tr. 38.) \n \n \nApplicant also incurred several collateral consequences of his punishment. The \nadmiral who imposed punishment also suspended Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (Tr. \n44.) Applicant\u2019s nuclear specialty pay of $550 per month was terminated, and he was \nrequired to pay back $27,000 of his enlistment bonus, at the rate of $550 per month. \nWhen Applicant was discharged, he still owed about $12,000, which has since been \npaid. (Tr. 46-49; GX 2 at 2.) He has calculated that his discharge two years before being \neligible for retirement cost him about $1.1 million in net retired pay after taxes. (AX E(3) \nat 4-6; Tr. 55. \n \n \nIn August 2014, Applicant appeared before a board convened to recommend \nwhether he should be administratively separated from the Navy because of his \ninvolvement in cheating on the EWS examinations. The three-member board, \ncomposed of a lieutenant commander, a lieutenant, and a senior chief petty officer, \nunanimously recommended that he be retained in the Navy. The board found that the \nmaterial that Applicant downloaded and printed was not classified and that his cheating \non the examination was negligent rather than willful. Based on his record of outstanding \nmilitary service, the board unanimously recommended that he be retained in the Navy.  \n \n \nThe commanding officer who convened the administrative board disagreed with \nthe board\u2019s findings of fact and recommendation. In November 2014, he initiated action \nto discharge Applicant \u201cin the best interest of the service.\u201d In his action he stated that \nApplicant admitted in a sworn statement that he tried unsuccessfully to pass the \u201cpencil \nbox\u201d to another sailor. (GX 7 at 3.) However, this statement was erroneous, because \nApplicant\u2019s sworn statement made no mention of efforts to pass the \u201cpencil box\u201d to \nanother sailor. (GX 7 at 13-15.)  \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant was discharged with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. The authority approving his discharge was the Secretary of the \nNavy. (GX 4.) At the time when the Secretary approved Applicant\u2019s administrative \ndischarge, the admiral who had imposed nonjudicial punishment had been promoted \nand assigned to a position in which he could have advised the Secretary on the decision \nto discharge Applicant and the characterization of his discharge. (Tr. 51-52.) Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence to show that the admiral advised the Secretary or influenced his \ndecision, but his attorney argued at the hearing that his harsh treatment should be \nconsidered in determining whether he should have a security clearance. (Tr.101-03.) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s active duty, he received the Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal four times, the Good Conduct Medal five times, and numerous \nservice awards and qualification badges. (AX A; AX C.) He received solid and \nsometimes outstanding performance evaluations as a first class petty officer, the last \ntwo rating him in the \u201cearly promote\u201d category, the highest recommendation. His three \n\n \n5 \n \nperformance evaluations as a chief petty officer, covering the period from September \n2013 to September 2015, rated him as \u201cpromotable,\u201d the middle category. (AX C at 7-\n12.) The evaluation for September 2013 to September 2013 specifically mentioned the \nnonjudicial punishment in March 2014. (AX C at 10.) \n \nApplicant has received three performance evaluations since his employment by a \ndefense contractor. His first evaluation for calendar year 2016 rated him as meeting \nstandards. His evaluations for 2017 and 2018 rated him as exceeding standards. (AX \nB.) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor for the past three years admires him for his natural \nleadership and dedication to duty, and he is confident that there is \u201czero chance\u201d of \nrecurrence. He noted that Applicant\u2019s duties were limited by the lack of a security \nclearance, but that he \u201cstepped up on his first day\u201d and worked diligently, performing \ndifficult, strenuous, and dirty jobs. He also noted that Applicant is a devoted husband \nand father, works long hours, and still finds time to coach youth sports and contribute to \nhis community. (AX D at 5.) \n \n Applicant\u2019s wife of 21 years, his mother, several close friends, several co-\nworkers, and several former shipmates submitted statements supporting reinstatement \nof his clearance. They attested to his devotion to his family and his community, \noutstanding leadership, loyalty, technical competence, integrity, and selflessness. (AX \n1-4, 7-18.)  \n \nA retired Navy captain who has known Applicant for almost 15 years testified at \nthe administrative discharge board, acknowledged the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \ncheating, and testified that he was confident that Applicant could be rehabilitated. He \ntestified, \u201cKnowing [Applicant], I would be extremely comfortable with him mentoring my \njunior sailors and that this whole ordeal will give him a different perspective on life. . . . I \nthink he would value integrity and honesty even more.\u201d (GX 7 at 36.) The captain also \nsubmitted a statement at the hearing, attesting to Applicant\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. (AX D at 17.)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted an affidavit declaring that he has been \ninvolved in no misconduct or mishandling of protected information since his nonjudicial \npunishment in March 2014. He included a statement of intent, declaring that if he is \ngranted a security clearance and involved in any further misconduct, he will not \nchallenge any revocation of his clearance. (AX E at 1.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n6 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges the violations of UCMJ Article 92, described above, for which \nApplicant received nonjudicial punishment. The security concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. . . .\u201d The relevant disqualifying conditions are:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThe evidence that Applicant arranged to have sensitive materials sent to him by \nunclassified personal email, printed them on an unclassified computer, improperly \nstored them in his barracks room, and used them to cheat on his EWS examination is \nsufficient to establish all three disqualifying conditions. His participation in a major \ncheating scheme and concealing it until it became public made him vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, and it seriously damaged his personal and \nprofessional standing. His falsification of a study log for a friend in 1998, at the \nbeginning of his Navy career, is too remote to constitute part of a \u201cpattern,\u201d but the \nseries of events involved in his participation in the \u201cpencil box\u201d scheme, which spanned \nseveral days, is sufficient to constitute a \u201cpattern.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious, because it \nundermined the system for insuring that sailors assigned to duties aboard nuclear \nsubmarines are technically qualified. It did not occur under unique circumstances. It was \nnot infrequent, because it involved a series of independent acts: actively seeking \ninvolvement in the cheating scheme, transmitting sensitive material by insecure means, \nstoring sensitive material in his barracks room, and cheating on the EWS examination. \nHowever, it occurred in December 2012, almost seven years before the hearing, and no \nsimilar conduct has occurred. He has expressed remorse and established a reputation \nas a trustworthy and reliable employee of a defense contractor.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is partially established. Applicant disclosed his participation in the \ncheating scheme as soon as he learned that the scheme had been discovered. He \nacknowledged his guilt during the nonjudicial proceedings and in all subsequent \nproceedings. He has expressed remorse. There is no evidence of counseling or other \nmeasures to \u201calleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors\u201d that caused his \nmisconduct. However, his behavior since the incident strongly indicates that recurrence \nis unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is established. Applicant self-reported his involvement in the cheating \nscheme, and he has been open and candid about his conduct. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged under Guideline E. AG \u00b6 33 \nexpresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected information:  \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information--which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information--raises \ndoubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \n\n \n9 \n \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n \nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or \nrevoking access to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Once it is established that an \napplicant has committed a security violation, he or she has a very heavy burden of \ndemonstrating that he or she should be entrusted with classified information. \u201c[B]ecause \nof the unique position of employers as actual administrators of classified programs and \nthe degree of knowledge possessed by them in any particular case, their determinations \nand characterizations regarding security violations are entitled to considerable \ndeference, and should not be discounted or contracted without a cogent explanation.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 10-7070 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2012.) \n \nSecurity violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program. \nThus, an administrative judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict \nscrutiny. See ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006).The frequency and \nduration of the security violations are aggravating factors. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 5 \n(App. Bd. July 14, 1998). \n \n \nThe evidence that Applicant obtained sensitive information via his unclassified \npersonal email, stored it in his barracks room, and used it to cheat on his EWS \nexamination establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 34(c): loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or \notherwise handling classified reports, data, or other information on any \nunapproved equipment or medium; and \n \nAG \u00b6 34(g): any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor other sensitive information.   \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 35(b): the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial \nsecurity training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the \ndischarge of security responsibilities. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a) is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 \n17(c). AG \u00b6 35(b) is partially established. There is no evidence that Applicant received \ncounseling or remedial training. Nonjudicial punishment and an administrative discharge \ndo not constitute counseling within the meaning of this mitigating condition. However, \n\n \n10 \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a \u201cpositive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities\u201d by self-reporting his involvement in the cheating scheme, expressing \nremorse, and putting himself on probation by agreeing that he will not challenge any \nrevocation of his security clearance for any future violations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E and K in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence and argument suggesting that his administrative \ndischarge from the Navy was unfair. However, the fairness and propriety of the \nadministrative discharge process are outside the jurisdiction of the security clearance \nprocess.  \n \nI am mindful that \u201c[o]nce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 8, 2011), citing \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 \n(1991). I am also mindful that security clearance adjudications are not intended to be \npunitive. \u201cJust as an unfavorable security clearance decision should not be based on a \nnotion that Applicant should be punished for his past misconduct, a favorable security \nclearance decision should not be based on a notion that Applicant has been punished \nenough for his past misconduct.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-24233 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2005).  \n \n \nApplicant allowed himself to be sucked into a massive cheating scheme, \nmotivated by his desire for professional advancement. He did not have the courage to \ndecline participation or to reveal it to proper authorities. However, he saw the light when \n\n \n11 \n \nthe cheating scheme was revealed, and he self-reported his involvement. He has shown \nremorse, and he has demonstrated his potential and determination to his current \nemployer. He has continued to work with dedication and to contribute to the U.S. Navy \nand the community where he lives. His friends, co-workers, supervisors, and former \nsupervisors are confident that he has put his past bad judgment behind him. He has \nagreed that, if he is granted a security clearance, he will not challenge any revocation \nfor future misconduct. I am satisfied that he is rehabilitated and that his dishonest and \nirresponsible conduct will not recur. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines E and K, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ncheating on the EWS examination and improper handling of protected information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K (Handling Protected Information): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n09/15/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to explain and \nmitigate her history of noncompliance with federal and state tax authorities, which is \nnow resolved and unlikely to recur in the future. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 16, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. She was interviewed as part of a background investigation in March 2017. \n(Exhibit 2) She replied to written interrogatories in July 2019. (Exhibit 2). Thereafter, on \nJuly 22, 2019, after reviewing the application and the information gathered during a \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining \nit was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \n\n \n2 \n \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 14, 2019. She admitted the allegations \nconcerning noncompliance with timely filing of federal and state income tax returns for a \nnumber of years. She also admitted owing back taxes for tax year 2018 in the amounts \nof $3,286 to the IRS and $520 to the state tax authority. She also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 17, 2019. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 3, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-3. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-E. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on December 13, 2019.  \n \nThe record was kept open until December 31, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to present additional documentation. Those matters were timely received \nand they are admitted without objections as Exhibits F-I.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 5) She is employed as an engineering support specialist for a large \ncompany in the defense industry. She has worked for this company since 2016. She \nhas a good employment record and is considered an outstanding employee. (Exhibit E; \nTr. 40-48) She married in 1986 and divorced in 1999. She has an adult son from the \nmarriage, and she is a grandmother.  \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of income-tax problems as follows: (1) failure to \ntimely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2009-2015, and 2018; (2) failure to \ntimely file state income tax returns for tax years 2009-2015, and 2018; (3) back taxes \nowed to the IRS in the amount of $3,286 for tax year 2018; and (4) back taxes owed to \nthe state tax authority in the amount of $520 for 2018. Applicant disclosed her income-\ntax problems when she completed her 2016 security clearance application, and she \nprovided additional information during the security clearance process. (Exhibits 1 and 2)  \n \nApplicant attributed her income-tax problems to her excessive use of alcohol. (Tr. \n57) She dates her sobriety to November 17, 2009. (Tr. 59) She explained that although \nshe had sufficient funds withheld for taxes, she fell behind in filing tax returns because \nshe was focused on maintaining her sobriety, one day at a time. (Tr. 57-58) She \ndescribed her tax problems as the \u201cwreckage\u201d of her past. (Tr. 58) She put off the tax \nmatters until she was at a point in her sobriety where she was able to handle the issue \nand then focused on cleaning up the \u201cwreckage\u201d of her past. (Tr. 58)   \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. \n(Exhibits 2, A, B, C, D, F, G, and I) She made contact with an accountant in late \n\n \n3 \n \nFebruary 2017 and filed federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, \n2015, and 2016. (Exhibit G) She repeated the process the following year for tax years \n2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2017. (Exhibit G) Going forward, she intends to continue \nusing the services of the accountant.  \n \nA review of the federal tax returns shows that Applicant was due a refund for tax \nyears 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017. (Exhibit 2) She owed the \nIRS $528 for tax year 2015, which she paid. Likewise, a review of the state income tax \nreturns shows that Applicant was due a refund for tax years 2009, 2010, 2013, 2015, \n2016, and 2017. (Exhibit 2) \n \nFor the most recent tax year of 2018, Applicant obtained an extension of time \nuntil October 15, 2019, to file her federal tax return, and it was timely filed on June 26, \n2019. (Exhibit A -- 2018 IRS Account Transcript) She filed her state income tax return \nthe same day. (Exhibit 2) She owed $3,286 for her federal return, and she owed $506 \nfor her state return. (Exhibit 2)  \n \nApplicant has paid all monies due the IRS. The following month after filing the \n2018 returns, she entered into a short-term payment plan with the IRS agreeing to pay \n$3,524 within the next 120 days, no later than November 28, 2019. (Exhibit B) She \nmade at least three payments during September and October 2019, and her account \nbalance for tax year 2018 is now $0. (Exhibit I)  \n \nLikewise, Applicant paid all monies due the state tax authority during the course \nof 2019. (Exhibits C and D) She owed a total of approximately $778 for tax years 2010, \n2011, 2012, and 2018. The state tax authority certified, in a document dated December \n11, 2019, that she has filed all returns and paid all taxes due, and that she is in good \nstanding. (Exhibit F)  \n \nHer overall financial situation appears to be stable based on a review of credit \nreports from 2019. (Exhibits 3 and H) Both are \u201cclean\u201d reports in that neither contains \nderogatory information. For example, a December 2019 credit report discloses 13 \naccounts, all of which are described as current with $0 past due, and five accounts have \nbalances of $0. (Exhibit H) \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant made great progress in resolving the income-tax matters, and she is \nnow in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means she filed all \ntax returns, as required; she paid all taxes due to the state tax authority, as required; \nand she paid all taxes due to the IRS, as required. And she did a good job documenting \nher compliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s income-tax problems and \nthe timing of her remedial action. Both are questions of fact that must be addressed. \nApplicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax returns for seven tax years, \n2009 through 2015. Payment of tax was a minor problem compared with the multiple \nyears of failure to file. She did so, as she explained during the hearing, due to her focus \non maintaining her sobriety and waiting to reach a point where she was able to handle \nthe tax matters.  \n \n \nTo her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems in her 2016 security \nclearance application, and she provided additional information during the security \nclearance process. She began taking remedial action in 2017, well before the SOR was \nissued, by retaining the services of an accountant and filing several years of returns. \nShe repeated the process the following year when she filed the remaining outstanding \n\n \n6 \n \nreturns. She has timely filed returns for the last three tax years, 2016-2018. She paid all \nback taxes (less than $5,000 in total) during the course of 2019. Recent credit reports \nshow she is a responsible user of credit and not financially overextended. She has a \ngood employment record and is considered an outstanding employee.  \n \n \nOrdinarily, I am not inclined to make a favorable decision in a case involving \nmultiple years of failure to file income tax returns. But I am persuaded this case is \ndifferent due to Applicant\u2019s explanation for why she incurred the tax problems, which I \nfound persuasive and worthy of belief. I am persuaded that Applicant has reached a \npoint in her sobriety where compliance with federal and state tax laws is no longer an \nissue for her. This is evidenced by her timely filing of tax returns for the last three tax \nyears (2016-2018), and her ability and willingness to pay back taxes in a relatively short \nperiod of time. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. The evidence \nis sufficient to justify mitigation of her history of noncompliance with her federal and \nstate income tax obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant asked me to consider his admissions and comments to the original SOR allegations. (Tr. 21-22) Those admissions and Applicant\u2019s admissions during his hearing are hereby incorporated into my findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 60-year-old principal engineer working for a federal contractor since January 2017. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and has completed several graduate-level courses, but has received no additional degrees. Applicant married his first wife in August 1988. They separated in August 2013 and divorced in January 2015. He has three adult children of this marriage: a son, age 30; a daughter, age 28; and a stepdaughter, age 43. 3 Between 1983 and April 1990, Applicant worked for a Federal agency (Agency) as an engineer-physicist. During this employment, he held a high-level compartmentalized clearance. Applicant was trained to report any foreign travel or any close and continuous contact with foreigners while holding a clearance. (Tr. 60) Between 1990 and 2002, he worked for four different companies, some foreign and some domestic, and sometimes his job took him to other countries. During this period, he held no clearance. Between September 2002 and December 2011, Applicant worked for a large Federal contractor. He submitted a SCA in December 2002, and was granted a high- level compartmentalized clearance.

Access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nJanuary 26, 2017, answered interrogatories from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on July 8, 2019, and submitted a sworn statement in November 28, \n2017. After reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) was unable to grant Applicant a clearance. On \nSeptember 4, 2019, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B \n(foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct). \n \nIn his September 24, 2019 answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Government moved to \namend the SOR allegations on January 22, 2020. The amendment modified the \nlanguage in SOR \u00b6 1.a; withdrew SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 2.a, and replaced them with \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nnew allegations; and withdrew SOR \u00b6 2.c (not replaced). Applicant denied all of the \namended SOR allegations on February 15, 2020. I marked and attached to the record \nthe Amendment to the SOR and Applicant\u2019s answer to it as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1.  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on June 26, 2020, and issued a Notice of \nHearing on July 10, 2020, scheduling a hearing for July 17, 2020. At the hearing, \nApplicant affirmatively stated that he had sufficient time to prepare for his hearing, was \nready to proceed, and waived his right to 15 days advanced notice of his hearing. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a closed hearing. (Tr. 11-12)  \n \nThe Government offered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6). GE 1 through 5 were \nadmitted without objection. GE 6 is a request for me to take administrative notice of the \ninformation about People\u2019s Republic of China (China). The document was marked and \naccepted for the limited purpose of taking administrative notice. Without objections, I \ntook administrative notice as requested. (Tr. 69) The noted facts are outlined in the \ndecision, infra. Applicant testified (presented no other evidence), as reflected in the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on July 24, 2020. \n \nAdditional Procedural Ruling \n \nAfter the presentation of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR to conform its allegations to the evidence presented. (Tr. 62-67) Applicant did not \nobject, and the SOR was amended as follows:  \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a was amended by excepting the words \u201cChinese national\u201d from the \nlast sentence, and substituting \u201cindividual\u201d. (Tr. 63) \n \n2. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were withdrawn. (Tr. 66) \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.d was amended by excepting the words \u201cpolygraph\u201d and substituting \n\u201cpersonal subject,\u201d and excepting \u201c2010 or 2011\u201d and substituting \u201cNovember 14, 2017.\u201d \n(Tr. 67) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant asked me to consider his admissions and comments to the original \nSOR allegations. (Tr. 21-22) Those admissions and Applicant\u2019s admissions during his \nhearing are hereby incorporated into my findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact:   \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old principal engineer working for a federal contractor \nsince January 2017. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and has completed \nseveral graduate-level courses, but has received no additional degrees.  \n \nApplicant married his first wife in August 1988. They separated in August 2013 \nand divorced in January 2015. He has three adult children of this marriage: a son, age \n30; a daughter, age 28; and a stepdaughter, age 43. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nBetween 1983 and April 1990, Applicant worked for a Federal agency (Agency) \nas \nan \nengineer-physicist. \nDuring \nthis \nemployment, \nhe \nheld \na \nhigh-level \ncompartmentalized clearance. Applicant was trained to report any foreign travel or any \nclose and continuous contact with foreigners while holding a clearance. (Tr. 60) \nBetween 1990 and 2002, he worked for four different companies, some foreign and \nsome domestic, and sometimes his job took him to other countries. During this period, \nhe held no clearance.  \n \nBetween September 2002 and December 2011, Applicant worked for a large \nFederal contractor. He submitted a SCA in December 2002, and was granted a high-\nlevel compartmentalized clearance. (GE 1) In January 2011, during the periodic \nreinvestigation of his clearance, Applicant participated in three polygraph-assisted \ninterviews. During the second interview, he disclosed to the investigators that he had \nbeen in an extra-marital affair from 1998 to present. Applicant resigned his position with \nthe Federal contractor in December 2011, but averred that it was not due to concerns \nabout losing his clearance. (Tr. 47) Between January 2012 and January 2017, he \nworked for several private companies, and held no clearance. In January 2017, \nApplicant was hired by his current employer, a Federal contractor, and submitted his \nmost recent SCA.  \n \nIn 1997, while working for a private company (holding no clearance), Applicant \nmet Ms. C. At the time, Ms. C was a Chinese national living in the United States with \nher husband (a Chinese national) as U.S. permanent resident card holders. They had \nentered the United States in 1991. (Tr. 74) In 1998, Applicant and Ms. C entered into a \nsecret, extra-marital affair that ended when they were married in May 2018. Applicant \nexplained that he entered into the affair with Ms. C because he was in a bad \nrelationship with his first wife with a lot of negativity. (GE 5) Applicant noted that at the \ntime he started the affair with Ms. C in November 1998, he worked for a private \ncompany and did not possess a clearance. Ms. C\u2019s first husband died around 2005. (Tr. \n32) Applicant and Ms. C continue to be married to present. \n \nMs. C became a U.S. naturalized citizen in October 2002. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe Amended SOR) Thus, Applicant had an affair with a Chinese national between 1998 \nand October 2002. Applicant was hired by a Federal contractor and submitted a SCA in \nDecember 2002. He did not disclose his close relationship with Ms. C because he \nbelieved that as a U.S. permanent resident card holder, she was considered a U.S. \nnational. He also noted that such disclosure was not required in the 2002 SCA. After \nOctober 2002, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen and there was no need to disclose \nhis close contacts with a U.S. citizen. Applicant was granted a clearance in 2002-2003, \nafter Ms. C became a U.S. citizen, and he believe he was not required to disclose his \naffair. (September 2019 Answer to SOR; Tr. 34-35) \n \nApplicant testified that he and Ms. C kept their extra-marital affair secret to \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. (Tr. 23) They did not \ndisclose their affair to any other person until he disclosed it to Agency interviewers \nduring his 2011 polygraph-assisted interviews. He averred that his 2011 disclosure was \nvoluntary, and it was made during his second polygraph-assisted interview to clarify the \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \ninterviewer\u2019s concerns about him being evasive. The only other people who knew about \nthe affair were his divorce lawyer and a psychologist he consulted on executing the \ndissolution of his first marriage. (September 2019 Answer to SOR; Tr. 23)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife and their children are not aware of the extent of the extra-\nmarital affair, and he is not willing to disclose the affair to his ex-wife and children. \nApplicant would rather turn down a clearance than tell his family about the affair. (Tr. \n52) He averred he could not be blackmailed because he would take the chance of \nlosing his family before giving up any classified or sensitive information. In his \nNovember 2017 sworn statement, Applicant told the investigator that there was no \ninfidelity on any one\u2019s part during his first marriage and that his affair was not a factor in \nhis divorce. (GE 5; Tr. 23) \n \nApplicant and Ms. C have represented to family and friends that their relationship \nstarted after he divorced his first wife in 2015. He intends to continue this false pretense \neven if it would result in him being denied a clearance. He explained that he values his \nrelationship with his children more than he values his employment. (September 2019 \nAnswer to SOR) He believes that if his children and his ex-wife were to find out about \nhis long-term extra-marital affair, they would think poorly on him. (Tr. 49) \n \nMs. C has a sister who apparently is a U.S. naturalized citizen. Her mother is a \ncitizen and resident of China. According to Applicant, his elderly mother-in-law (89-90 \nyears old) suffers from dementia and requires a caregiver. (Tr. 25) Ms. C and her sister \nalternate traveling to China every year or every other year to visit and care for her \nmother. His mother-in-law receives a pension from her late husband. In addition, she \nowns two apartments in China, one of which is rented for income. Any additional \nfinancial expenses are covered by Ms. C and her sister. (Tr. 61-62) \n \nApplicant testified that he has never travelled to China. (Tr. 54) He considers his \ncontact and communication with his mother-in-law casual and infrequent. He believes \nthat there is little likelihood that his relationship with her would create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. Applicant recognizes that the government of China is a \nruthless communist dictatorship and promised to remain alert to any attempts by any \nperson or entity to exploit his relationship with his mother-in-law. He also promised to \nreport any such contacts to appropriate U.S. authorities immediately. Applicant believes \nthat he has deep life-long relationships and loyalties in the United States, and he \npromised to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. (September \n2019 Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant successfully established that Ms. C was never a dual citizen of China \nand the United States. She was a Chinese national until her U.S. naturalization in \nOctober 2002. The Chinese government does not allow or recognize dual citizenship. \nChinese nationality is lost upon acquiring citizenship in another country.  \n \nApplicant noted that Ms. C has been a U.S. citizen for 18 years. During that time \nshe has developed long-standing relationships in the United States, and her allegiance \nis solely to the United States. (Tr. 23) He reiterated that if he was ever involved in any \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nconflict of interest between a foreign individual, group, organization or government \nentity, he would resolve that issue in favor of the United States interests. (Tr. 75) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (China).  \n \nThe leading state intelligence threats to U.S. interests are China and Russia, \nbased on their services' capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. The United \nStates faces a continuing threat to its national security from Chinese intelligence \noperations. \n  \nChinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic and cyber espionage against the United States, and are considered \n\"aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and \ntechnology.\" Importantly, \"China's intelligence services, as well as private companies \nand other entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties \nto China who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets \nusing removable media devices or e-mail.\" There have been multiple prosecutions by \nthe U.S. Dept. of Justice of those who participate in espionage and other crimes that \nbenefit China. \n  \nAdditionally, China continues to have significant human rights issues including \narbitrary and unlawful killings by the government, torture, arbitrary detention, life-\nthreatening prison and detention conditions, political prisoners, censorship, and overall \nsubstantial restriction on basic human rights. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \npromulgated by the Director of National Intelligence in Security Executive Agent \nDirective (SEAD) 4 (December 10, 2016), which are applicable to all adjudicative \ndecisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nmust be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nIn substance, under Guideline E, the SOR alleges and the evidence established \nthat: \n \n1. From November 1998 to January 2015, Applicant engaged in a secret extra-\nmarital affair with a Chinese national who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October \n2002. From January 2015 to present, Applicant has misrepresented to family and \nfriends that he did not start dating Ms. C until after his January 2015 divorce. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) \n \n \n2. Applicant falsified material facts during a personal subject interview with a \nGovernment investigator on November 14, 2017, when he stated that there was no \ninfidelity during his previous marriage, when in fact he had been having a long-time \nextra-marital affair. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following conditions that could raise a security concern \nand be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations . . . . \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 17-year extramarital affair, his misrepresentations to family and \nfriends, and his lack of candor and dishonesty with government investigators \ndemonstrate questionable judgment, unreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, establishing the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. Only two of those mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to \nthe facts in this case: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant has not demonstrated that his questionable behavior has significantly \nchanged. He engaged in a 17-year extramarital affair that led to his divorce in 2015. He \nmarried his paramour in 2018, but his deception of family and friends (pretending his \nrelationship with his current wife started after the divorce) continues to present. \nApplicant intends to continue the false pretenses surrounding his extra-marital affair \neven if this would result in the denial of his clearance eligibility. He values his \nrelationship with his children more than he values his employment. Applicant is \nconcerned that if they found about his affair, his children and family would think poorly \nof him.  \n \nThus, I find that Applicant is currently vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. Furthermore, his long-term lack of candor, dishonesty, and questionable \njudgment raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to fully establish any mitigating \nfactors under AG \u00b6 17. \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nIn substance, under Guideline B, the SOR alleges and the evidence established \nthat: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen who travels to China \napproximately every other year, to visit her elderly mother. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born, raised, and educated in China. She immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1991, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2002. Her \nmother and extended family members are citizens and residents of China. She is close \nto her mother, has frequent contact with her mother or caretaker, and travels to China to \nvisit and care for her mother every year or every other year. Ms. C and her sister \nprovide financial support for their mother. Applicant, directly or through his wife, is also \npresumed to have a close relationship with his mother-in-law.  \n \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s relationships with residents of China create a concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and his \ndesire to help his wife or her relatives who live in China. For example, if foreign \nintelligence agents or government officials wanted to subject Applicant to coercion, they \ncould exert pressure on her or her relatives residing in China. Applicant would then be \nsubject to coercion through his wife or her relatives and classified information could \npotentially be compromised. \n \nAn applicant\u2019s possession of close family ties with their family living in a foreign \ncountry are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, its \nhistory of intelligence gathering, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government or the country is known to conduct intelligence \ncollection operations against the United States. The relationship of China with the \nUnited States, and its \u201chistory of conducting pervasive espionage against the United \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nStates, puts a heavy burden of proof on Applicant\u201d to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith family members living in China do not pose a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 12-\n04780 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2013). Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire \nto assist relatives living in China.  \n \nThere is no evidence that intelligence operatives from any foreign country seek \nor have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his \nrelatives living in China. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in \nthe future. Applicant\u2019s relationships with family members living in China create a \npotential conflict of interest because these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about his desire to assist relatives in China by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts or relationships with family living in China, raising the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established and further inquiry is necessary about \npotential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists four conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002)). Applicant has ties of affection for his wife, and by marriage to his in-laws, as \nindicated by his wife\u2019s frequent contact with her mother and other relatives in China.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) are not applicable. Applicant, directly or through his wife, has \nfrequent contact with his mother-in-law, who is a citizen and resident of China. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) partially applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s, and his wife\u2019s \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith the United States must be weighed against the potential conflict of interest created \nby his and his wife\u2019s relationships with family living in China. Applicant has strong \nconnections to the United States. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s wife has maintained \nstrong connections to her family members living in China.  \n \nChina is a leading intelligence threat to U.S. interests based on its services \ncapabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. The United States faces a continuing \nthreat to its national security from Chinese intelligence operations. Chinese actors are \nthe world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic and cyber espionage \nagainst the United States, and are considered aggressive and capable collectors of \nsensitive U.S. economic information and technology. Importantly, China's intelligence \nservices, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to exploit \nChinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to \ncorporate networks to steal trade secrets using removable media devices or e-mail. \nThere have been multiple prosecutions by the U.S. Dept. of Justice of those who \nparticipate in espionage and other crimes that benefit China. Additionally, China \ncontinues to have significant human rights issues.  \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant failed to meet his burden of \nshowing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with family living in China] could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I also find that Applicant\u2019s connections \nto the United States are outweighed by his and his wife\u2019s connections to China in the \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nsecurity analysis. Foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B are not \nmitigated.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c)) I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E \nand Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen who has worked for a Government Agency and federal \ncontractors over the years, and for his current employer and clearance sponsor since \n2017. He held clearances in the past and there is no evidence of any past security \nviolations. \nA Guideline B decision concerning a foreign country must take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation and dangers in that country including from intelligence agents. \nConsidering China\u2019s pervasive espionage against the United States, and China's \naggressive intelligence services, as well as the targeting of private companies and other \nentities, frequently seeking to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to \nChina, Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s contacts with Chinese family members create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to mitigate the foreign influence security \nconcerns. The weight of the evidence does not support granting Applicant\u2019s clearance.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \n \nWithdrawn by DC \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn by DC \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility \nfor a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 28, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Position (SF 86). (Item 3) On July 19, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Item 1) \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue eligibility \nfor a public trust position for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \ndenied, or revoked. Specifically, the SOR set forth trustworthiness concerns arising under \nGuideline F (financial considerations). (Item 1) \n \nOn August 13, 2019, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested \na decision without a hearing. (Item 2) On October 18, 2019, Department Counsel \ncompleted the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On November 8, 2019, Applicant was \nserved with a copy of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response, if any, was due on December 8, \n2019. No response was received. On January 23, 2020, the case was assigned to me.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c \nthrough 1.k, and 1.m. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior systems analyst who has worked for the same \nemployer since January 2007. (Item 3) In 1984, he graduated from high school. (Id.) He \nhas no military service. (Id.) In 1984, he married, and his five children were born in 1984, \n1985, 1987, 1992, and 2000. (Id.) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nIn December 1999, Applicant was having financial problems, and he filed for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Item 5) The bankruptcy enabled \nhim to develop a plan under the bankruptcy court\u2019s supervision to repay all or part of his \ndebts. In March 2006, his unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter \n13. (Item 5) He received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. This \nbankruptcy was not listed on his SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 28, 2018 SCA shows no periods of unemployment after \n2007. (Item 3) He also disclosed several financial issues in his SCA. (Id.) He said: \n \nTwo and [a] half to three years ago we took on full financial responsibility of \ntwo grandkids unexpectedly. The burden has taken a toll on us financially. \nWe tried to work with our creditors but none of them were willing to work \nwith us. The everyday burden of our normal lives, which included our own \n16 year old son and helping to put our 4th son through college, was a tight \nsqueeze, but we were managing it. When we took on a then [three to four] \nyear old and a then [six to seven] year old, it just broke the bubble. As I \nstated, we tried to work with our creditors, but none were willing to budge. \nIt was an option of feed/support our new growing responsibility and let our \nfinances suffer . . . or not take care of the family. We are still in full \ncustody/care of the grand kids and our youngest son is a senior ready to \nhead off to college.      \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \n \n(Id. at 33) He listed delinquent debts on his SCA as follows: $1,267; $6,642; $7,562; \n$3,269; $1,167; $1,060; $427; $779; $8,184; $4,976; and $3,255. (Id. at 32-43) In \nresponse to the question on his SCA about actions to resolve debts, he said that he was \nworking to file bankruptcy. (Id.) \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $32,035, as follows: 1.a ($427); 1.b \n($28); 1.c ($3,269); 1.d ($1,060); 1.e ($4,976); 1.f ($6,699); 1.g ($1,167); 1.h ($1,267); 1.i \n($3,255); 1.j ($799); 1.k ($1,136); 1.l ($390); and 1.m ($7,562). (Item 1) The support for \nthe SOR allegations is found in Applicant\u2019s credit report and Officer of Personnel \nManagement personal subject interview. (Items 4, 6)  \n \nIn his August 13, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said he did not recognize the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b for $28. (Item 2) He said he was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $1,267. \n(Id.)  He thought the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $427 and 1.l for $390 were the same debt, as \nthey both originated from the same bank. (Id.) He explained that his spouse was unable \nto work outside their home because she needed to care for their two grandchildren. (Id.) \nPart of their financial pressure resulted from their efforts to fund their fourth child\u2019s college \neducation. (Id.) He reiterated his plan was to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code; however, he had not yet discussed this plan with an attorney. (Id.) He \nindicated that he enjoyed providing support to service members and wished to do so in \nthe future. (Id.) He is dedicated to providing that support and wanted to give service \nmembers \u201cthe best service possible.\u201d (Id.)   \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nuncorroborated statements, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant paid, \narranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The \nFORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin which to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, \nor explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional \ninformation . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4) He did not respond to \nthe FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance [or a public trust position].\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access \nto classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See \nId. at 527.  \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made.   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive presumes there \nis a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not \nrequired.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance [or access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nsecurity.\u201d Decisions are in terms of the national interest and not a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern raised by financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security [or trustworthiness] concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate \nfunds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security [or trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may result from \ncriminal activity, including espionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified [or sensitive] information in order to raise \nmoney in satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to \nexamine the totality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. \nThe Judge must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national \nsecrets as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The \nDirective presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the \nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility [or eligibility for a public trust \nposition].  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. \nJan. 7, 2010) (internal citation omitted), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility \n[or eligibility for a public trust position], there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or maintenance of a security clearance [or eligibility for a public \ntrust postion]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security [or trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance [and public trust] decisions is that \narticulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified [or sensitive] information will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $32,035. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege his debts were discharged under Chapter 13 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code in 2006. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may \nbe considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nIn his August 13, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said he did not recognize the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b for $28. He said was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $1,267; however, he \ndid not provide any documentation showing such payments. He thought the debts in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a for $427 and 1.l for $390 were the same debt, as they both originated from the same \nbank. I have credited Applicant with mitigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b because Applicant \ndenied responsibility and due to the size of the debt ($28), it is de minimis. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l for $390 is mitigated as a duplication.  \n \nApplicant said his delinquent debts resulted from the unanticipated necessity of \ncaring for two grandchildren. His spouse was unable to work outside his home because \nshe needed to care for their grandchildren. In addition, he wanted to pay for college \neducation for a child.  \n \n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or \nshe maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. He does not receive full mitigating credit under AG 20(b) because he did \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nnot provide enough information about his finances to establish that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of his 2006 bankruptcy. He \nsubsequently accrued the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. He did not establish under \nAG \u00b6 20(c) that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.\u201d He did not provide a budget, and it is not possible to assess whether he is living \nwithin his means. \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). Applicant did not \nprove he acted in good faith. \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) \nproof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or \na letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of \ncredible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he \ndid not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to \nmake greater documented progress resolving 11 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c through 1.k, \nand 1.m. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved \nand will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior systems analyst who has worked for the same \nemployer since January 2007. In 1984, he graduated from high school. In 1984, he \nmarried, and his five children were born in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1992, and 2000. He and his \nspouse are caring for two grandchildren. He has successfully been employed by the same \nemployer for more than 12 years. There is no evidence that he has violated his employer\u2019s \nrules involving protection of sensitive information. \n \nThe evidence against grant of access to sensitive information is more substantial. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems going back to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin which his debts were discharged in 2006. Applicant currently owes 11 delinquent debts \nthat were alleged in the SOR totaling $31,617. There is no corroborating documentation \nof progress after the SOR was issued in the resolution of 11 of these debts. His actions \nraise unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position, there is a strong presumption against granting access to sensitive \ninformation. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set \nforth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are \nnot mitigated. Unmitigated financial considerations trustworthiness concerns lead me to \nconclude it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a public trust position at this time.  \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is making payments under Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) and state installment plans to address his tax debts. He has made progress getting \nhis financial house in order; however, he did not prove he was unable to timely file his tax \nreturns and to make greater documented progress sooner resolving his state and federal \nincome tax debts. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 5, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn November 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec.

(HE 1A) The hearing was cancelled due to the coronavirus. On June 20, 2020, \nI coordinated with Applicant\u2019s Counsel to set a hearing date.

They allege he has delinquent \nfederal income taxes as follows: 2010 ($5,830); 2013 ($5,278); 2014 ($15,701); and 2017 \n($6,451). SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant filed to timely file his state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2018, and he owes the state $18,361 for delinquent state \ntaxes. \nBefore his marital difficulties, Applicant timely filed his tax returns. (Tr. 16, 62; SOR \nresponse at 3) He said his spouse left him in 2010, and he was required to pay $1,900 \nmonthly for child support during the divorce proceedings. (Tr. 16; SOR response at 3) He \nwas also required to pay the mortgage on the family residence. (Id.) When his divorce \nwas finalized, his monthly child support was set at $2,139, and he was required to pay \nhis children\u2019s medical expenses and some other expenses. (AE E) He unsuccessfully \nattempted to obtain a reduction in his child support payment from the court. (SOR \nresponse at 3) Beginning in May 2016, he had $2,674 automatically garnished from his \npaycheck for child support, which included payment for an arrearage. (Tr. 20; SOR \nresponse at 3; AE F) He had to pay attorney fees for his divorce. (Tr. 45) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant said due to stress, he \u201cforgot that he had an \nobligation to file his income taxes.\u201d (HE 3 at 3) His former spouse took their children with \nher when she left, and he was upset. (Tr. 17) Some of the delay in the filing of his tax \nreturns was caused by the necessity to obtain needed documentation that was in storage \nand on his accountants\u2019 or tax preparers\u2019 failures to correctly or expeditiously file his tax \nreturns. (Tr. 49, 50-52; AE P) He subsequently filed all necessary tax returns. (SOR \nresponse at 3) During his September 13, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interview (PSI), Applicant said he did not timely file his tax returns \nbecause he did not want to pay the government. (GE 2 at 14)  \nApplicant has lived with his parents since 2010 to assist with their medical care \nand their finances. (SOR response; AE V) In 2010, his mother was diagnosed with breast \ncancer. (AE V) In 2012, his mother was diagnosed with a gallbladder illness which \nrequired surgery, and in 2015, his mother was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease \nand a blood clot on her lungs. (AE V) In 2018, his mother was diagnosed with chronic \ngastric inflammation, and she retired from her DOD employment because of her illness. \n(AE V) In 2015, his father was diagnosed with kidney and prostate cancer, which required \nsurgery in 2016. (AE V) In September 2019, his father was diagnosed with congested \nheart failure, and is currently under treatment. (AE V) His father is or was an owner-\noperator truck driver with no medical benefits, and when he took time off to help his \nspouse during her illness, the family lost income.

(AE H; AE L) There \nis no evidence of security violations. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA \nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant was separated from his spouse in 2010, and divorced in 2016. Applicant \nalso indicated his parents had serious medical problems, and he provided financial and \nother support to them. He had financial stress from having to pay child support, attorney \nfees, and other expenses. Divorce and medical problems are circumstances beyond his \ncontrol that adversely affected his finances. \nApplicant has taken important steps towards showing his financial responsibility. \nHe filed all required tax returns and made substantial progress addressing his tax debt. \nHe paid his federal tax debt for tax year 2010. He also had taxes withheld and paid to the \nIRS from his salary. Notwithstanding his excellent progress in 2020, in 2019, he only \nmade three payments totaling $605, which were in addition to his federal income tax \nwithholding payments. \nFrom June 2017, to May 2018, he made monthly payments to the state tax \nauthority from $200 to $250, and he paid his state tax debt for tax year 2013. On May 22, \n2018, he owed the state tax authority $14,582 for tax year 2014. From May 2018, to July \n2019, he made monthly payments to the state tax authority from $200 to $250, and he \nreduced his state tax debt for tax year 2014 to $13,162. In August 2020, he paid the state \ntax authority $7,501 for the following tax years: $3,453 (tax year 2015); $3,230 (tax year \n2017); and $818 (tax year 2018). As of August 2020, he owed the state tax authority \n$11,561. \nAppellant said he forgot about filing his federal and state tax returns due to stress \nfrom his relationship with his spouse, difficulty obtaining records, and problems with tax \npreparers. These excuses are not persuasive because he failed to timely file his tax \nreturns over an extended period of time. From April 15, 2011, to November 25, 2019, he \nwas late filing various tax returns as follows: 2010 (filed June 3, 2013); 2013 (filed August \n10, 2015); 2015 and 2016 (filed November 25, 2019); and 2017 and 2018 (filed July 30, \n2019). \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . . make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability.

United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure \nto timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to \nan Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, the Appeal Board \nprovided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (noting Applicant filed \nhis 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and received a $2,074 tax refund. \nHe filed his 2012 Federal tax return in September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return \nin October 2015. He received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for \n2013). In ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nIn sum, Applicant provided evidence of mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) \nbecause he received financial counseling, generated a budget, filed his tax returns, \nestablished payment plans with the IRS and state tax authority, and complied with those \npayment plans for a sufficient period of time to indicate he currently intends to timely file \nand pay his taxes. However, there is insufficient evidence showing Applicant\u2019s multiple \nfailures to timely file his tax returns were prudent good-faith decisions. He did not establish \nhe was unable to make greater progress sooner resolving his delinquent tax debts. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior network and administrative security professional. \nHe has 20 years of experience as an information technology specialist. He attended \ncollege for several years, and he received numerous information technology certifications. \nHe was married from 2003 to 2016, and he has two children. Four coworkers, supervisors, \nor managers lauded Applicant\u2019s performance and trustworthiness. The general sense of \ntheir statements is that he is dedicated, detail oriented, talented, dependable, \nprofessional, helpful, honest, reliable, and conscientious. His diligence and other positive \nattributes contributed to the success of the enterprises where he was employed. He is an \nexcellent employee who made substantial contributions to his company and the national \ndefense over a lengthy career. There is no evidence of security violations. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed \na grant of a security clearance for a retired Navy E-9 and cited his failure to timely file \nstate tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal tax returns for tax years \n2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his \ntax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal \nBoard highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax \nexpenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d). \nThe Appeal Board reversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a \ncase where the applicant filed his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis 2012 tax return in August 2015 all before the SOR was issued. ISCR Case No. 15-\n03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). The applicant owed less than $1,800 in federal \nincome taxes for those four tax years at the time of the decision. Id. The Appeal Board \nfound the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be important stating: \n \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. \nId. at 5. \nApplicant filed all of his tax returns and made substantial progress paying his \nfederal and state tax debts. His remaining tax debt is relatively low in comparison to his \nincome. He has substantial child-support responsibilities. However, the primary problem \nhere relates to the timing of Applicant\u2019s filing of his federal and state income tax returns. \nApplicant knew that he needed to timely file his income tax returns. He may not have fully \nunderstood or appreciated the importance of this requirement in the context of his \neligibility for access to classified information. When the OPM investigator questioned him \nin 2018, he promised to get his tax returns filed \u201cthis month.\u201d He did not file the tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016 until November 25, 2019. (AE T) He did not establish he was \nunable to make greater progress sooner in the resolution of his tax issues. His actions \nunder the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security \nconcerns. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant\u2019s failure \nto \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 22, 2019, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf.

Despite having \nbeen given a month to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. \nThese allegations are found against Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has a \nhistory of delinquencies. Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial problems \nare unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 9, 2017. \nOn June 10, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. Applicant \nanswered the SOR on July 10, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The Government was ready to proceed on August 5, 2019, and the case was \nassigned to me on August 9, 2019. On August 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September \n26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I were admitted, \nwithout objection. I received the transcript (TR) on October 17, 2019. I held the record \nopen until November 27, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. \nShe timely submitted AE J through AE Z, which are admitted without objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, single, and has one 13-year-old son. She was married \nfrom 2000 until she divorced 2007. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004, and \nexpects to receive a master\u2019s degree in cyber security in June 2020. She enlisted in the \nU.S. Army Reserve in 1999 and served on active duty in the Army from February 2005 \nuntil August 2006. Applicant then served in the Air Force Reserve from 2007 until 2008, \nand in the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2011. She received honorable discharges for \nall of her various periods of service. She has worked for a defense contractor as a \nknowledge management and information technology specialist since September 2017. \nApplicant has held a clearance off and on since approximately 1999, and she has held a \ntop secret clearance for the past three years. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 10-15, 30-36) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has fourteen delinquent debts totaling almost \n$71,000. Additionally, the SOR alleges that she failed to file her 2016 state and federal \nincome tax returns in a timely manner, as required by law. Applicant\u2019s financial issues \nstarted in approximately 2006 after she left active duty. She was not intentionally \nnegligent toward her financial responsibilities; however, various life circumstances \ncontributed to her inability to pay her obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has worked for federal contracting companies on and off since 2007; \nhowever, she has experienced various periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nWhen her son was born in 2006, Applicant was unemployed. She relied on his father for \nfinancial support during that 9-month period of unemployment as well as other periods of \nunemployment. Since leaving the abusive relationship with the child\u2019s father in 2015, she \nhas received child support on an inconsistent basis. She has also incurred significant \nlegal fees contesting her son\u2019s father\u2019s petitions for reductions of his child support \nobligations. Over the years, Applicant has also provided financial help to her mother \nduring significant financial events. Applicant served as her mother\u2019s caregiver as she \nbattled cancer in 2012 and during another health crisis in 2014. Applicant has also \nexperienced her own health issues that have negatively impacted her finances. (GE 1; \nGE 2; GE 3; AE A; AE E; AE J; AE R; AE S; AE T; AE U; AE W; Tr. 36-37, 48-51, 69, 72) \n \n \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s debt consist of 11 student loans, which currently total \napproximately $50,000. The loans were opened between 1999 and 2014. She fell behind \non the older student loan accounts in approximately August 2006, after she left active \nduty. At that time, she was unemployed and pregnant. She made periodic payments, but \nalso deferred the loans and put them in forbearance status. Once the forbearance and \ndeferments expired, Applicant struggled to make regular payments. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3 \nat 7-8; AE A; AE B; AE J; AE K; AE L; Tr. 41-44, 47) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation demonstrating that she has been rehabilitating \nher loans which are currently being administered by a third-party company. She has been \nmaking $24 monthly payments, as required, since July 2019. In March 2020, the accounts \nwill be reevaluated, and then she will make payments to the Department of Education. \nHer 2015 and 2016 federal tax return refunds were seized and applied to her student loan \ndebt. Since April 2016, payments totaling over $14,282 have been made toward this debt. \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant is using her GI Bill benefits to pay for her master\u2019s program and is not incurring \nnew student loan debt. (AE A; AE B; AE J; Tr. 44-50) \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant purchased a used vehicle for $10,499 with a 24% interest rate. \nWithin months it suffered several mechanical issues, and she could not afford both the \ncar payments and repair costs. Additionally, from June to September 2017, she was on \nshort-term disability due to her thyroid surgery. In July 2018, Applicant\u2019s vehicle was \nrepossessed, and the $13,315 balance was placed for collection. Applicant started \ncontacting the lender in June 2019, and settled and resolved this debt in October 2019 \nwith a payment of $5,100. (GE 4 at 5; AE A; AE D; AE J at 5; AE M; Tr. 24-25, 52-54) \n \n \nDuring the summer of 2019, Applicant agreed to settle the alleged $440 utility bill. \nShe made payments in July, August and September 2019 totaling over $110. She made \nan additional payment of $25 in November 2019. This debt will be resolved in February \n2020. (GE 2; GE 3 at 9; AE A; AE E; AE G at 8; AE J at 6; AE Z; Tr. 55-58) \n \n \nApplicant denied the alleged $100 medical debt because she did not recognize the \ndebt. After the issuance of the SOR, she contacted the creditor and learned it is legitimate, \nand it was incurred in 2013. She contacted the creditor prior to the hearing and was told \nthat due to the age of the debt the creditor had closed out the debt. She then disputed \nthe debt with the three credit reporting companies. (GE 2; GE 3 at 9; GE 4; AE A; AE F; \nAE G; AE Q; Tr. 25-26, 58-61) \n \n \nApplicant used a professional tax preparer for tax years 2015 through 2018. In \n2017, Applicant believed that the tax preparer that she had used for previous tax years \nhad submitted her 2016 state and federal income taxes in a timely manner. The tax \npreparer, who was elderly, did not mail Applicant\u2019s 2016 taxes. In August 2019, Applicant \nand her preparer filed her state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n2018. She had previously filed for extensions for tax years 2017 and 2018. Applicant \nreceived a refunds for her 2016 state and federal income taxes, and her federal return \nwas applied to her student loans. She has a $2,536 obligation with the IRS for tax year \n2017. In August 2019, she submitted an installment agreement request for tax year 2017. \nApplicant has an installment agreement to pay her state income taxes. (AE A; AE C; AE \nJ at 7-8; AE N; AE O; Tr. 23, 38-41, 47-48, 61)  \n \nApplicant received credit counseling from 2004 until 2006, while she was in the \nArmy Reserve, and in 2016 through her church. She follows a written budget, is able to \nlive within her means, and has no new delinquent debts. Applicant identified that she did \nnot learn how to handle finances from her family, and she has been working to correct \nthis issue by attending counseling and following a written budget. Additionally, she has \nbeen attempting to secure a second job to help pay down her debt. (AE G; AE J, at 7; AE \nP; Tr. 65-70)                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant received an Army Good Conduct Medal; National Defense Service \nMedal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Army Service Ribbon; and a \nmarksmanship badge. Applicant also provided eleven letters of recommendation from \nfriends, family members, and work associates. She is described as a person of \n\n \n4 \n \n\u201cincomparable moral and ethical character\u201d who is determined and hard working. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor of two years wrote that she has \u201chad no cause for concern \nregarding her performance. [Applicant] is dependable, thoughtful, and well regarded\u2026\u201d \nand she recommended that Applicant receive her clearance. Applicant\u2019s most recent \nperformance appraisal recognized that she is responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (AE \nH; AE I; AE Y; Tr. 27-28, 71) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n\n \n6 \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues related to various periods of \nunemployment, underemployment, family-related issues, and medical issues. She started \nworking with credit counselors before the issuance of the SOR to address her delinquent \ndebts, and she has worked to address her financial obligations. Her efforts demonstrate \na good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and the record evidence demonstrates that the \ndebts are either resolved or under control. \n \nApplicant has filed state and federal income tax returns for 2016. She has no \noutstanding debt for this tax year. She was forthright and honest at the hearing when \nquestioned regarding her 2017 and 2018 state and federal income tax returns. She has \nan outstanding obligation for her 2017 federal return and her state income taxes, but she \nis working to resolve these debts through installment agreements. \n \nThe Directive does not require that applicants be debt free or have perfect \nfinances. Applicant could have worked harder to resolve her debts in a timelier manner; \nhowever, she has admitted that she lacked experience, knowledge, and understanding \nregarding the importance of finances. She did not intend to be financially irresponsible, \nand she intends to continue to make payments toward her student loans and outstanding \nstate and federal taxes. Applicant\u2019s various personal and professional letters of \nrecommendation demonstrate that she is a dependable, hardworking, and responsible \nperson.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant follows a written budget and pays her current financial obligations. She \nis willing and able to live within her means, which is reflected in the testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) \nare established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. Based upon \nthe record evidence, I have no doubts that Applicant is not a security risk. \n \nI conclude Applicant met her burden of proof and persuasion. She mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns and established her eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics in September 2010, and his master\u2019s degree in computational science, engineering, and mathematics in August 2012. He took some courses online from January 2014 to January 2017, and earned a graduate certificate. He has worked for the same defense contractor since August 2012, after interning for the company in the summer of 2011, and he is currently a senior research associate. Applicant indicated on a July 2014 security clearance application that he was granted an interim secret-level clearance in July 2014, although he has not worked on any classified projects. (GEs 1-2, AE A; Tr. 24.) Psychological Conditions Applicant first sought mental health treatment in 2000, when he was 13 years old. He was struggling with depression, had low self-esteem, and lacked motivation. He was prescribed a mood-stabilizer medication at that time because of his family history of bipolar disorder, and he has been voluntarily receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment and counseling since then. (GEs 3-4.) At age 17, in December 2003, Applicant had a manic episode after he ran out of his Lamictal medication while on a family vacation.

He \ncontinues to consume alcohol regularly to intoxication. He used marijuana from 2002 to \n2016, and prescription stimulants illegally 2002 to 2005, January 2007 to January 2008, \nand in July 2018. Psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated, but drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and alcohol consumption security concerns persist. \nClearance eligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I (psychological conditions), Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and Guideline G (alcohol consumption). The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \n\n2 \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 9, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn January 24, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to \nproceed to a hearing. On February 5, 2020, the case was assigned to me to conduct a \nhearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On February 10, 2020, I scheduled a hearing \nfor March 3, 2020. \n \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Seven Government exhibits (GEs 1-7) and one \nApplicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 11, 2020. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Answer \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline I that Applicant was hospitalized for a manic \nepisode in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); with major depressive disorder (moderate), bipolar I disorder, social anxiety \ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder (moderate), and cannabis use \ndisorder (severe) in remission in March 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and with bipolar I disorder, \nsocial anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder in October 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under \nGuideline H, Applicant is alleged to have used and purchased marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2002 through at least 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to have used Adderall \nwithout a prescription from 2004 through at least 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Under Guideline G, \nApplicant is alleged to have been pulled over while driving in 2009 and to have failed a field \nsobriety test (SOR \u00b6 3.a), and to continue to consume alcohol to intoxication despite a \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder (SOR \u00b6 3.b). \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in response to the SOR, but asserted that he had \nonly experienced a single manic episode, takes medication to prevent future episodes, and \nregularly and consistently sees a medical provider for his conditions, which are under \ncontrol with treatment. Applicant indicated that any use of marijuana since 2006 has been \n\u201crare and isolated.\u201d While he had a problem abusing marijuana during his youth, he \nreceived treatment and considers it fully in the past. He explained that he used Adderall as \na study aid in college and his recreational use was limited to an isolated incident in 2018. \nHe denied any intent to repeat that behavior. As for the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns, Applicant stated that he learned his lesson from the failed field sobriety test in \n2009 and does not operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated. He explained his alcohol use \nas follows: \n \nI use alcohol to mitigate the symptoms of Depression and Anxiety. I fully \nacknowledge that this behavior is unhealthy and disordered. I\u2019m receiving \n\n3 \n \ntreatment through the form of talk therapy and am working to modify my \nconsumption accordingly. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics in September 2010, and his master\u2019s degree in \ncomputational science, engineering, and mathematics in August 2012. He took some \ncourses online from January 2014 to January 2017, and earned a graduate certificate. He \nhas worked for the same defense contractor since August 2012, after interning for the \ncompany in the summer of 2011, and he is currently a senior research associate. Applicant \nindicated on a July 2014 security clearance application that he was granted an interim \nsecret-level clearance in July 2014, although he has not worked on any classified projects. \n(GEs 1-2, AE A; Tr. 24.) \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \n \nApplicant first sought mental health treatment in 2000, when he was 13 years old. \nHe was struggling with depression, had low self-esteem, and lacked motivation. He was \nprescribed a mood-stabilizer medication at that time because of his family history of bipolar \ndisorder, and he has been voluntarily receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment and \ncounseling since then. (GEs 3-4.) \n \n \n \nAt age 17, in December 2003, Applicant had a manic episode after he ran out of his \nLamictal medication while on a family vacation. Over the course of two weeks, he became \nextremely talkative with rapid speech, grandiose ideas, insomnia, and held a delusional \nbelief. His mother took him to an emergency room, and he was admitted to a hospital for \ntwo weeks in January 2004 and treated for diagnosed depression. (GE 4; Tr. 25.) On his \ndischarge from the inpatient psychiatric treatment, Applicant was prescribed Lithium, and \nhe resumed his mental health treatment under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist \nfor diagnosed bipolar I disorder. (GE 4; Tr. 26-27.) \n \n \nClinical notes from his then treating psychiatrist in August 2010 indicate that \nApplicant\u2019s bipolar I symptoms were under good control on the antidepressants Zoloft and \nSertraline, and the mood-stabilizers Lamictal and Lamotrigine. During a psychiatric \nevaluation at the university health services for a transfer of providers when he moved for \ngraduate school in September 2010, Applicant related that he was consuming alcohol \nthree nights a week, three to four drinks per occasion, and six drinks on the weekend days. \nHe stated he was not using any illegal drugs. He reported feeling \u201cdefinitely depressed,\u201d \nand worrying excessively. Applicant reported some improvement in functioning over the \nprevious two years. He was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, most recent episode \ndepressed, moderate. Applicant was started on Abilify medication, and he began weekly \ntherapy with a psychologist in the community while continuing to meet with a psychiatrist at \n\n4 \n \nthe university\u2019s health services department. Applicant continued to struggle with \ndepression, with some exacerbation of symptoms around academic examinations. (GE 4.) \n \n \nDuring a session with his university health services\u2019 psychiatrist on March 2, 2011, \nApplicant reported a significant improvement in mood since his previous session in \nDecember 2010. He was taking Lamictal and Zoloft medication with good effect, \nexperiencing no mood swings, and continuing in therapy with a psychologist in the \ncommunity. During his next session, which occurred in May 2011, Applicant reported no \nmania or severe depression, although he had downward turns of mood lasting several \nhours or days and moderate generalized anxiety. He had a pattern of relying on alcohol to \nmedicate for his anxiety. He was advised to obtain care from a psychiatrist in the local \ncommunity. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant had a final session at university health services. He \nadvised that he had not found a new psychiatrist and was running low on his medications. \nHe was given a 14-day supply of Zoloft and contact information for some local \npsychiatrists. His mental health was assessed as fairly stable. (GE 4.) The psychologist \nwho treated Applicant on a regular basis from September 2010 to December 2011 for \ndiagnosed bipolar disorder indicates that their sessions focused primarily on managing \nApplicant\u2019s depression and related issues. Applicant exhibited no serious problems with \njudgment or impulse control, and no serious behavioral or psychiatric issues. (GE 5.) \n \n \nAfter earning his master\u2019s degree in August 2012, Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer. (GE 1.) Life stress led Applicant to retreat into a very depressive episode \nin late 2013. He missed approximately one month of work because of his depression and \nchecked himself into a three-week partial hospitalization program. The treatment consisted \nprimarily of talk therapy, medication adjustments as needed, and support to regain his \nstability after the depressive episode. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 29-30.) \n \n \nOver the years, Applicant\u2019s medication dosages have been adjusted to address his \nmental health issues. He continues to experience depression and intense anxiety, but he \nhas not had any symptoms of mania since 2003. (Tr. 25-26.) He currently takes \nLamotrigine (a mood-stabilizer), Lexapro, Ativan, and Wellbutrin for his mental health \nissues. (Tr. 27-28.) He sees his psychiatrist once every two months for medication \nmanagement and his psychologist every two weeks for counseling. (GEs 6-7; Tr. 29.) \n \n \nApplicant began a therapeutic relationship with his current psychiatrist in April 2013 \n(GE 6) and with his psychologist in March 2015. (GEs 2, 7.) Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist \ndiagnosed him with bipolar I disorder (single manic episode, most recent episode \ndepressed); social anxiety disorder; and generalized anxiety disorder. Between April 2013 \nand March 2016, Applicant experienced four episodes of depression but no hypomania or \nmania. Applicant took his medications as prescribed and had extended psychotherapy. \n(GE 6.) During his intake with his current psychologist, Applicant presented with episodic \ndepression and problems with social anxiety. The psychologist diagnosed him with major \ndepressive disorder, moderate, recurrent, and with social anxiety disorder. As of March \n2016, Applicant had attended 41 sessions with his psychologist. He was actively committed \n\n5 \n \nto working on ways to manage his symptoms and keep them from interfering with his life. \nHis treating psychologist indicated that Applicant was particularly responsive to cognitive-\nbehavioral interventions to decrease problematic thoughts, and he made considerable \nprogress in the area of being more active in pursuing social interactions and confronting his \nanxieties. His mood was stable and bright for several months as of March 2016. (GE 7.) \n \n \nOn October 6, 2018, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a clinical \npsychologist at the request of the DOD CAF. Applicant reported that he continues to \nexperience approximately four depressive episodes of varying intensity per year. He \nreported experiencing symptoms of anxiety, especially in social settings, although he \nexhibited no observable signs of anxiety. He expressed an understanding of the \nseriousness of his condition and of the importance of taking his psychiatric medications as \nprescribed. The psychologist assessed Applicant\u2019s judgment as good and his insight as \nintact. Clinical testing revealed no marked elevations indicative of psychopathology, but \nsome potential problems with regard to his anxiety, albeit still within the normal range. The \npsychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s single manic episode at age 17 could have been \ntriggered by the anti-depressant medication he was taking at the time, and she gave him a \ngood prognosis as to the risk of another manic episode. Depression was more prominent, \nbut the psychologist noted that his depressive symptoms had not negatively interfered with \nhis work environment since 2014. Applicant showed that he is able to identify triggers for a \ndepressive episode (i.e., that they are more likely to occur in the winter, after the \ndissolution of a romantic relationship, or when he is overwhelmed at work), but this insight \nwas considered to be a strength in that it allows him to be proactive in utilizing his coping \nskills, and taking measures to minimize the impact of his symptoms. The clinical \npsychologist assessed his prognosis for future depressive episodes as poor in that they are \nlikely to occur throughout his life, but the chronicity of his depression has a fairly predicable \npattern that makes his condition \u201cquite stable.\u201d Applicant\u2019s ongoing anxiety could \nexacerbate or serve as a trigger for his depressive episodes, although it could serve as \u201ca \nprotective factor when it comes to judgment and impulsivity.\u201d The clinical psychologist \nconcluded about his mental health conditions as follows: \n \n[Applicant] does have chronic mental health conditions, including Bipolar I \nDisorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, that are being appropriately managed \nand treated, and they are currently stable. Even when symptomatic, it is not \nbelieved that these conditions pose any significant risks to his judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. Additionally, \nthe risk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health problems is \nlow. \n  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana regularly in high school, initially once or twice a month \nstarting at age 16 in approximately 2002. After his hospitalization for his manic episode in \n2003, Applicant began to consider ceasing his marijuana use. He understood that his \nmarijuana use contributed to his lack of motivation and caused him intense anxiety. Yet, by \nage 18, he was using marijuana daily and sometimes multiple times per day. His marijuana \n\n6 \n \nuse was social with friends, and he used marijuana because his friends were using it. (GEs \n2-3; Tr. 30-31.) Applicant reported to a psychiatrist in September 2010 that he was \n\u201cconsistently high\u201d from smoking marijuana between the ages of 18 and 20 (between 2004 \nand 2006). (GE 4.) \n \n \nInitially, Applicant used marijuana shared by his friends, occasionally contributing \nmoney for marijuana or splitting the cost of marijuana with others. By age 18, he was \npurchasing marijuana once or twice a week at a cost of $40 each time. Approximately once \nevery couple of months, Applicant sold some of his marijuana to friends, but not for profit. \n(GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant decided to reduce his marijuana use because it made him feel paranoid \nand interfered with his productivity. He no longer purchased marijuana after 2005, but he \ncontinued to use marijuana once a year to once every couple of years to at least 2016. \n(GEs 2, 4; Tr. 31.) During a session with his then treating psychiatrist in late May 2011, \nApplicant reported that he was using marijuana rarely, less than once a month. (GE 4.) \nDuring his personal subject interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator on May 3, 2017, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana once every couple \nof years. (GE 2.) At his March 2020 hearing, he described his marijuana use since \napproximately 2005 as \u201conce a year tops.\u201d (Tr. 32.) \n \n \nOn July 24, 2014, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning \nany illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he used marijuana \nbetween September 2002 and November 2011, stating, \u201cIn high school I smoked \nmarijuana recreationally with some periods of heavy use. In college, I used it on the rare \noccasion.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future \nand explained that he used the drug as a teenager and was no longer interested in using it. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question concerning any illegal drug purchase in the last \nseven years. He responded \u201cYes\u201d to an inquiry into whether he had intentionally misused a \nprescription drug in the last seven years, and disclosed that he had used \u201cConcerta\u201d \nbetween January 2007 and January 2008 \u201cas a stimulant for pulling all night study sessions \nin college.\u201d (GE 1.) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana after he completed his SF 86. He used marijuana while \nvacationing with college friends in June 2015, and another time in 2016. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-\n32.) About his use in June 2015, he told the OPM investigator in May 2017 that he wanted \nto confirm that he no longer liked the drug, and that after taking two hits of marijuana from \na bowl, he felt uncomfortable and stoned. (GE 2.) Applicant held a \u201cmisguided notion\u201d that \nhis drug involvement would not be disqualifying because he was truthful about his \nmarijuana use, did not have a serious addiction problem, and his use was restricted to \n\u201clighter substances such as marijuana or Adderall.\u201d (Tr. 35-36, 44.) Applicant states that he \nwould not have used marijuana if he understood it was a problem for his security clearance \neligibility. (Tr. 44.) \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAs of March 2016, Applicant was diagnosed by his treating psychiatrist with \ncannabis use disorder, severe, but in remission. (GE 6.) During his May 2017 subject \ninterview, Applicant admitted that he has friends who currently use marijuana, and that his \nroommates use marijuana in their home, but not in his presence. He indicated that he \nmade a personal choice to stop using marijuana, but when asked about his future intent, \nhe expressed \u201ca reasonable expectation\u201d that he may smoke marijuana in the future, once \nevery few years, depending on the situation. (GE 2.) During his psychological evaluation for \nthe DOD in October 2018, Applicant admitted to the evaluating psychologist that he used \nmarijuana as recently as 2016 and would be open to using marijuana again. He also stated \nthat, although his friends use marijuana, he has been able to refrain from using it. (GE 3.) \nApplicant knew that marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, notwithstanding the \nstate\u2019s decriminalization of recreational use of marijuana. (Tr. 46.) \n \n \nAt his hearing in March 2020, Applicant expressed a willingness to abstain from \nmarijuana use if he is granted a clearance. (Tr. 34, 44.) He testified that he would \n\u201cpotentially\u201d use marijuana in the future if he does not have a clearance. (Tr. 34.) Applicant \nlived with persons who used marijuana from September 2016 to September 2018. Within a \nfew months of his March 2020 security clearance hearing, he was at a small social \ngathering with persons who smoked marijuana in his presence. He did not use any \nmarijuana at that time because he had no desire to use it, as he \u201cgenerally\u201d does not enjoy \nit at this point in his life. (Tr. 45-46.) As to why then he would then consider the possibility \nof future marijuana use, especially given its illegality under federal law, Applicant testified: \n \nThat\u2019s a legitimate question. Part of it is just out of curiosity, just to see if [it] \nstill affects me in the way that it does right now, in the way that provokes just \nanxiety. (Tr. 46.) \n \n \nApplicant used Adderall without a prescription about once every two to three months \nfrom 2002 to 2005. He obtained the drug from friends. (GE 2.) While he was in college, \nApplicant used Adderall or Concerta \u201ca handful of times\u201d from January 2007 to January \n2008 as a study aid. The drugs were not prescribed for him. (GEs 1-2.) During his May \n2017 subject interview with the OPM investigator, he denied any intention to misuse either \nAdderall or Concerta in the future. (GE 2.) Yet, he used Adderall recreationally at a party in \nJuly 2018 while socializing with some friends from college. The drug was given to him by a \nfriend who had a prescription. (GE 3; Tr. 35.) Applicant did not think his substance misuse \nwas a problem for his clearance eligibility because he did not have a serious drug problem \nand his use was of a \u201clighter substance.\u201d In hindsight, he would not have used it had he \nrealized it posed a problem for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant knew that \ntaking a drug not legally prescribed for him was against the law, but he did not think much \nof it because \u201c[it] was in a controlled environment, private environment. And there was no \npotential of harm to [himself] or others at the time.\u201d (Tr. 53.)  \n \n \nThe licensed clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October \n2018, expressed her belief that his marijuana use poses no significant risk to his judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, given he had not used the drug with any regularity since 2005. \nHis use of Adderall in July 2018 was \u201ca moment of poor judgment, especially considering \n\n8 \n \nhis mental health conditions and the fact that he is in the process of undergoing a security \nclearance determination. The psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s drug use did not meet a \nclinical level of pathology, and that more often than not, Applicant is able to make good \ndecisions. However, she deferred to the adjudicators as to whether his recent misuse of a \nstimulant in July 2018 is relevant to his security worthiness. (GE 3.) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nApplicant drank alcohol a few times in high school, but he did not enjoy it. After two \nyears at a community college, he transferred to a four-year university in January 2007. He \nwas pulled over in 2009 and failed a field sobriety test, but he was not charged with an \nalcohol offense. (GE 3.) While at the university, Applicant began drinking six or more beers \non the weekends at bars to be social. In September 2010, he started graduate school. He \nsocialized with others who drank alcohol, and over the next two years, his drinking \nincreased to five to seven days per week, three to four beers on weeknights and five to six \nbeers on the weekends. As of March 2011, Applicant reported drinking alcohol two days \nduring the work week, up to three drinks per day, and six drinks on both weekend nights. \n(GE 4.) In February 2011, Applicant had been advised by his psychologist that his drinking \nwas likely exacerbating his depression. Applicant was reportedly mildly defensive with his \npsychologist about his drinking, and expressed that it was the only really bright spot in his \nweek in that alcohol helped him feel less anxious. Despite being advised of the risk that \nalcohol posed for his bipolar disorder, Applicant did not plan to quit drinking, although he \ntold his psychologist he would consider reducing his weekday consumption. (GE 5.)  In late \nMay 2011, Applicant admitted to his then treating psychiatrist that he was consuming \nseven to eight drinks on Friday and Saturday nights regularly to get drunk, and three to four \ndrinks two other nights of the week. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn October 2011, Applicant acknowledged to his mental health providers that he was \ndrinking too much. He was drinking daily up to five beers at a sitting during the week and \nmore on the weekends. Applicant expressed no interest in ceasing his alcohol use. (GE 5.) \n \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant\u2019s current psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use \ndisorder, moderate. Applicant regularly engaged in binge drinking (in excess of six drinks in \nan evening) since he began treatment with the psychiatrist in 2013. (GE 6.) However, the \npsychiatrist told the DOD-contracted clinical psychologist in October 2018 that Applicant \nhas shown an ability to control his alcohol use, as demonstrated by periods of voluntary \nsobriety for a couple of months at a time, and that he had never recommended to Applicant \nthat he refrain from all alcohol use. Given Applicant uses alcohol to alleviate his anxiety in \nsocial situations, his treatment with his psychiatrist has focused on strengthening other \ncoping skills. (GE 3.) \n \n \nThe clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October 2018, \nindicated that Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol is of concern because it exceeds general medical \nrecommendations for the use of alcohol per the National Institute of Health\u2019s guidelines, \nand he may be self-medicating his anxiety with alcohol instead of relying on psychological \nor pharmacological methods. She diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, mild, but \n\n9 \n \nexpressed her opinion that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use did not present an acute security \nconcern because the amount Applicant consumes is \u201cmediated by age-normative social \nexperiences in which alcohol is commonly seen as a social lubricant;\u201d his alcohol use has \nnot impaired his work; and it is not contrary to his treating psychiatrist\u2019s recommendations. \nThe psychologist found that Applicant did not minimize his alcohol use and concluded that \nhis use of alcohol did not rise to the point of impaired judgment. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his treating psychiatrist has recommended that he consume \nless alcohol. (Tr. 41.) About 90% of Applicant\u2019s drinking has been social, but he also drinks \nalcohol to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Since at least May 2017, Applicant \nhas played trivia at a bar on Tuesday nights with friends. (GE 2.) As of October 2018, \nApplicant reported that he was drinking alcohol (usually beer) five to seven days per week, \nin quantities of three to five beers on weeknights and six beers at a sitting on the \nweekends. He had hangovers a few times per month. He expressed his belief that he \ndrinks too much, but it helps him to feel more confident and less anxious. (GE 3; Tr. 41.)  \nAs of March 2020, Applicant was playing \u201cbar trivia\u201d and billiards at a bar. He started doing \ntrivia as an undergraduate in college and has been playing in a pool league for about a \nyear. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 47-48.) He had a \u201cdry January\u201d in 2020 where he abstained from \nalcohol for one month. He had no intention to maintain abstinence from alcohol and \nresumed drinking (usually beer) in his previous pattern of two or three drinks almost every \nnight and five to six drinks on the weekends over a course of about five hours while \nsocializing with friends, frequently at his apartment. (Tr. 50-52.) As of March 2020, \nApplicant was drinking to intoxication \u201cnot each night of the week, but more so than not \nprobably.\u201d (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant now believes his alcohol use is having a negative health \neffect in terms of long-term disadvantages should he continue to use alcohol to alleviate \nsymptoms of depression and anxiety. (Tr. 41-42.) He has been trying to reduce his \nconsumption for years, but the motivation to change is \u201cnot super strong.\u201d (Tr. 49.) He \nconsiders his alcohol use a \u201cpersonal concern\u201d that does not impact his professionalism or \nability to handle classified information. (Tr. 44.) \n \nWork Reference \n \n \nApplicant enjoys his job. He has missed work at times due to his depression, but his \nsupervisor is supportive. (GE 3.) Applicant has had the same supervisor since August \n2012. Applicant\u2019s supervisor described Applicant as \u201ca dependable and dedicated \ncoworker with keen insights, great analytic skills, and a terrific knack for working in a team.\u201d \nApplicant is willing to assist his coworkers, and is a mentor to junior staff. He has good time \nmanagement skills, is diligent about his work, and takes project objectives seriously, often \nworking beyond regular hours to meet tight deadlines. Applicant always represents their \nemployer well when interacting with clients. His supervisor expressed complete confidence \nin Applicant and his character. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \n\n10 \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \n\n11 \n \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant has been receiving pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy since \nhe was 13 years old, initially for depressive symptoms. After he had a manic episode with a \ndelusional belief at age 17, he was psychiatrically hospitalized for two weeks in January \n2004 and given a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. In April 2013, he began a therapeutic \nrelationship with his current psychiatrist. Applicant experienced four episodes of depression \nbut no mania between April 2013 and March 2016, when his treating psychiatrist \ndiagnosed him with bipolar I disorder (single manic episode), social anxiety disorder, and \ngeneralized anxiety disorder. While working for his current employer, Applicant \nexperienced a depressive episode in late 2013 that caused him to miss work. He \nunderwent voluntary treatment for three weeks in a partial hospitalization program. In \nMarch 2015, Applicant began counseling with his current therapist, a psychologist, for \ndiagnosed major depressive disorder (moderate, recurrent), and social anxiety disorder. In \nOctober 2018, he was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and social anxiety disorder by a \nduly-qualified clinical psychologist, who evaluated him for the DOD. Applicant reported that \nhe continues to experience approximately four depressive episodes of varying intensity per \nyear, and has current symptoms of anxiety. The psychologist gave Applicant a good \nprognosis as to the risk of another manic episode but a poor prognosis for future \ndepressive episodes due to the chronicity of his condition. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 are established, as follows: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n\n12 \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bipolar I disorder is a chronic condition primarily characterized by \ndepressive symptoms, although he did have a manic episode with delusional thought in \nlate 2003. A duly-qualified psychologist for the DOD indicated that he is likely to suffer from \ndepressive episodes in the future, but she also indicated that his condition is \u201cquite stable.\u201d \nApplicant has shown that he is able to recognize the triggers for his mental conditions and \nseek treatment when necessary. AGs \u00b6 29(a), 29(b), and 29(c) have some applicability in \nthat his conditions appear to be controllable with treatment. His anxiety disorder is an \nongoing issue for him, and the clinical psychologist indicated that it could serve as a trigger \nfor depressive episodes. However, she also concluded that the risk to his judgment and \nreliability is low. While exacerbations of his mental health conditions cannot completely be \nruled out, Applicant has a long history of taking his medications as prescribed under the \ncare of a psychiatrist and participating in counseling with a psychologist. The psychological \nconditions security concerns are mitigated. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \n\n13 \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana on a regular basis from 2002 through 2005. His \nuse increased to where he used the drug daily, and sometimes multiple times daily, from \n2004 through 2005. He continued to use marijuana at a significantly reduced frequency, \nonce a year or once every couple of years, until his most recent use in 2016. Applicant \npurchased marijuana in 2004 and 2005, once or twice a week at a cost of $40 each time. \nApplicant used Adderall or Concerta, which were not prescribed for him, once every two to \nthree months from 2002 to 2005. He used the stimulants again \u201ca handful of times\u201d from \nJanuary 2007 to January 2008 as a study aid in college. In July 2018, while socializing with \nsome college friends, Applicant used Adderall recreationally at a party. Disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d applies because of his illegal use of \nmarijuana and prescription stimulants. AG 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled \nsubstance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies because of his purchases of marijuana. AG \u00b6 \n25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) of substance use \ndisorder;\u201d warrants some consideration because Applicant was diagnosed by his treating \npsychiatrist with cannabis use disorder, severe, but in remission, in March 2016. \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s future intentions, AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d is established. Applicant denied any future intention of \nmarijuana use when he completed his SF 86 in July 2014. However, during his May 2017 \npersonal subject interview, Applicant expressed that he may use marijuana in the future, \nonce very few years, depending on the situation. During his October 2018 psychological \nevaluation for the DOD, Applicant indicated that he would be open to using marijuana \nagain. At his March 2020 hearing, Applicant expressed a willingness to abstain from \nmarijuana in the future if he is granted security clearance eligibility, while admitting that he \nwould \u201cpotentially\u201d use marijuana in the future if he is not granted a clearance.  \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \n\n14 \n \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 26(a), Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana has been infrequent, once a year or once every couple of years, since 2005 or \n2006. His last use of marijuana was three or four years ago, depending on when he used it \nin 2016. Even so, he used marijuana one time each in 2015 and 2016 after he completed \nhis SF 86 for security clearance eligibility. He used Adderall without a prescription as \nrecently as July 2018. Applicant no longer lives with anyone who uses marijuana, but he \ncontinues to socialize with friends who use marijuana. Only a few months before his March \n2020 hearing, he was at a small social gathering with persons who smoked marijuana in \nhis presence. There is no evidence that Applicant used marijuana on that occasion, and he \nexplained that he had no desire to use it. Applicant now maintains that he would not have \nused marijuana in June 2015 and 2016 or Adderall in July 2018 had he realized that his \ninvolvement would have presented a problem for his security clearance eligibility. At his \nMarch 2020 hearing, he expressed a willingness to abstain from marijuana, but it was \nconditioned on a favorable adjudication of his clearance eligibility. Applicant continues to \nentertain the possibility of future marijuana use depending on the situation. Moreover, he \nraised considerable doubts about any commitment to abstain by using marijuana after he \nindicated that he had no intention to use marijuana in the future. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nWhile in college, Applicant began drinking six or more beers on the weekends at \nbars to be social. He failed a field sobriety test in 2009 when he was pulled over, although \nhe was not charged with any offense and his blood alcohol level on that occasion is not in \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s drinking increased while he was in graduate school from September \n2010 to August 2012. He was told by his then treating psychologist in February 2011 that \nalcohol was exacerbating his depression. Yet, by May 2011, Applicant was consuming \nseven to eight drinks on Friday and Saturday nights, regularly to get drunk, and three to \n\n15 \n \nfour drinks two other nights of the week. In March 2016, Applicant was diagnosed by his \npsychiatrist with alcohol use disorder, moderate. His psychiatrist advised him to reduce his \nalcohol consumption, but Applicant continued to drink in pretty much the same pattern as \nhe had in graduate school. In October 2018, Applicant reported drinking primarily beer five \nto seven days per week, in quantities of three to five beers on the weeknights, and six \nbeers per sitting on the weekends. The psychologist who evaluated him for the DOD \ndiagnosed him with alcohol use disorder-mild. As of March 2020, Applicant was consuming \ntwo or three alcoholic drinks almost every night and five to six drinks on the weekend days. \nWhile about 90% of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption has occurred while socializing with \nothers, he was also using alcohol to self-medicate for anxiety. He was drinking to \nintoxication, not every night but \u201cmore so than not probably.\u201d \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are applicable to a greater or \nlesser extent: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; and  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \nApplicant failed a field sobriety test in 2009. It is the type of behavior contemplated \nwithin AG \u00b6 22(a). However, evidence of intoxication on that occasion is limited, and there \nis no evidence of any other incident of driving while impaired. Regarding AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201cbinge \nconsumption of alcohol\u201d is not defined in the AGs or the Directive. The National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a \nperson\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This typically \nhappens when men consume five or more drinks, and when women consume four or more \ndrinks, in about two hours. See https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm. \nApplicant testified that he drinks six beers over the course of five hours, which may not \nqualify as binge drinking, if he spaces out the drinks. That being said, he admitted that he \ndrinks to intoxication more often than not. An individual whose faculties are habitually \nimpaired by alcohol does not exhibit the sound judgment and responsible behavior required \nof a person entrusted with or seeking access to classified information. The protection of \nclassified information is a 24-hour-per-day responsibility and extends to off-duty hours. The \nclinical psychologist for the DOD indicated in her October 2018 evaluation report that \n\n16 \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use \u201cexceeds medical recommendations for use of alcohol, per \nNIH/NIAAA guidelines.\u201d  \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder by his treating psychiatrist in \nMarch 2016 and by the clinical psychologist, who evaluated him for the DOD in October \n2018, so AG \u00b6 22(d) applies. The evidence to establish AG \u00b6 22(f) is less clear. Applicant\u2019s \ntreating psychiatrist recommended to Applicant that he reduce his alcohol consumption, \nalthough the psychiatrist has not recommended to Applicant that he completely abstain \nfrom alcohol use. Given Applicant uses alcohol to alleviate his anxiety in social situations, \nhis treatment with his psychiatrist has focused on strengthening other coping skills. His \nalcohol consumption was not shown to be currently against treatment recommendations for \nhis mental health issues. \n \nOne or more of the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances it is unlikely to recur or does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) cannot reasonably apply because Applicant drinks with some regularity \nto intoxication as of March 2020. Concerning AG \u00b6 23(b), Applicant currently believes he is \ndrinking too much, but he lacks the motivation to appreciably change his drinking habits. \nHe has not had treatment specifically targeting his alcohol use, so neither AG \u00b6 23(c) nor \nAG \u00b6 23(d) are fully established. To the contrary, it appears that Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, \nwhile recommending that Applicant reduce his alcohol consumption, has to some extent \naccepted the role that alcohol plays in minimizing the symptoms of Applicant\u2019s anxiety \ndisorder, and he has not recommended any substance abuse treatment for Applicant, \ndespite the fact that he has diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, moderate. \n\n17 \n \n \nIn assessing whether Applicant\u2019s longtime pattern of consuming alcohol five to \nseven days per week, in quantities of three to five beers per sitting during the work week \nand six beers a sitting on the weekend days, presents an unacceptable security risk, I \ncannot ignore the assessments of duly-qualified mental health practitioners because of \ntheir qualifications and experience. Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist indicated in March 2016 \nthat Applicant adheres responsibly to the treatment plan, but the psychiatrist did not \naddress Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption specifically. The clinical psychologist who \nevaluated Applicant for the DOD opined in October 2018, in part: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] alcohol use is of concern. His use exceeds general medical \nrecommendations for use of alcohol, per NIH/NIAAA guidelines. Further, \nboth [Applicant] and his treating psychiatrist noted that one purpose of his \nuse of alcohol was to reduce his social anxiety; this raises concerns that he \ncould be self-medicating his condition instead of relying upon more orthodox \npsychological or pharmacological methods of reducing his anxiety. Despite \nthese concerns, it is my opinion that [Applicant\u2019s] alcohol use is not an acute \nsecurity concern as there are other factors that mitigate the pathology of his \nuse. That is, the amount of alcohol [Applicant] consumes appears in part \nmediated by age-normative social experiences in which alcohol is commonly \nseen as a social lubricant and in which activities often surround alcohol \nconsumption, such as bar-hopping. It should be noted that his alcohol use \nhas never impaired his ability to work as he has remained a reliable \nemployee for the past 3-4 years. Further, [Applicant\u2019s] use of alcohol is not \ncontrary to his medical practitioner\u2019s recommendations and his treating \npractitioner, who is apparently aware of his alcohol use pattern, has not \nrecommended he seek any additional substance use treatment. [Applicant] \nhas maintained good candor in reporting the amount of alcohol he uses, \neven when he has expressed a concern that, at times, he drinks too much. In \nother words, he did not appear to self-censor or minimize his use of alcohol \nas others may have done in this circumstance. Therefore, it is difficult to \nconclude that his use of alcohol rises to the point of impaired judgment. (GE \n3.) \n \n \nThe clinical psychologist clearly had some concern about Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption, especially his use of the substance to self-medicate his anxiety symptoms.  \nHowever, she did not consider those concerns to be acute largely because there was no \nevidence of impaired judgment at his workplace related to alcohol; his drinking is largely \nsocial and typical of his age and circumstances; and he appears to be in control of his \ndrinking. At the same time, she diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder-mild, which \nindicates that he met two of eleven diagnostic criteria for clinical pathology of an alcohol \nuse problem within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition \n(DSM-5). Notwithstanding the psychologist\u2019s clinical opinion, I am concerned that \nApplicant\u2019s habitual consumption of alcohol to intoxication presents a risk to his ability to \nhandle classified information. The alcohol consumption security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \n\n18 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has been a diligent, productive, and reliable worker for his employer since \nAugust 2012, despite missing some work to address his chronic mental health conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has complete confidence in him and has no hesitation about \nattesting to his good character. It is unclear if Applicant\u2019s supervisor knows that Applicant \nused marijuana and non-prescribed Adderall while undergoing evaluation for security \nclearance eligibility; that Applicant drinks to intoxication on a regular basis; and that he is \nnot presently motivated to change his drinking habits or willing to commit unequivocally to \nno marijuana use in the future. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted, I am unable to conclude that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n\n19 \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 2, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant, 58, has worked as a material handler for three different federal contractors since January 2012. His education history is not in the record. He served in the U.S. Army for two years until he failed a drug test in 1984. He received a General Discharge under Other than Honorable Conditions. He married in 1994 and was divorced in 2004. Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2012 in connection with his 3 employment with the defense contractor.

His response was \nreceived by DOHA on January 2, 2020, about 37 days after his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant provided a two-page formal response and three proposed exhibits, which in one \ncase consisted of nine letters grouped together as an exhibit. He marked the documents \nas Exhibits A through C. I have marked these exhibits as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-C and \nthe document attached to Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR as AE D. I have marked Items \n1 through 5 attached to the FORM as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, respectively. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 15, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nOn or about January 2, 2020, Department Counsel submitted an objection to the \nadmissibility of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM and AE A though C on the basis that it \nwas untimely. Applicant response was received by DOHA about a week after the \ndeadline. His submission preceded the date the file was assigned to me. Department \nCounsel has not asserted that the timing of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM and his \nsubmission of three proposed exhibits caused any prejudice to the Government. In the \ninterest of fairness to Applicant, Department Counsel\u2019s objection is overruled. (See \nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.10 and E3.1.19.) Applicant\u2019s response \nto the FORM and AE A through C are admitted, as well as AE D, which was not the \nsubject of an objection. Absent any objection, GE 1 through 5 are also admitted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the allegations set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c in my findings of fact, and I have noted his comments on each \nallegation. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 2, his SCA, unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, \nand the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 58, has worked as a material handler for three different federal \ncontractors since January 2012. His education history is not in the record. He served in \nthe U.S. Army for two years until he failed a drug test in 1984. He received a General \nDischarge under Other than Honorable Conditions. He married in 1994 and was divorced \nin 2004. Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2012 in connection with his \n\n3 \n \nemployment with the defense contractor. With the submission of his March 2018 SCA, he \nseeks to renew his clearance eligibility.  \n \nSOR Allegations, Evidence and Findings \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \u2013 Two Credit-Card Accounts with a Creditor Charged-Off \nin the Amounts of $1,528 and $192, respectively \u2013 Applicant opened two credit-card \naccounts with the same creditor in October 2014 and February 2016. In March 2017, he \ndefaulted on both accounts, and they were charged off. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nresponded that he had been making payments on the smaller debt and that his last \npayment would be made on September 6, 2019. He also wrote that he was in contact \nwith the creditor and intended to begin making payments on the larger debt once the \nsmaller debt was paid off. In his FORM response, he updated the status of the larger debt \nthat is the subject of SOR \u00b61.a. He wrote that he made arrangements to pay the creditor \nand that the account will be satisfied by March 31, 2020. (GE 4 at 2, 4, 6; GE 5 at 2-4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Car Loan Charged Off in the Amount of $15,310 \u2013 Applicant \nopened this account in April 2015 to finance the purchase of a car. The original amount \nof the loan was $25,928. He stopped paying the loan in January 2018 due to a dispute \nwith the lender. He stored the vehicle, a convertible, in a family member\u2019s garage during \nthe winter and reduced his insurance coverage by dropping the collision coverage while \nthe vehicle was stored. In response, the lender increased his monthly payments from \n$533 to $1,019. Applicant was unable to pay the increased monthly amount, and he \nvoluntarily returned the car to the lender in February 2018. He understood that after the \nresale of the vehicle, he was obligated to pay a deficiency of $2,000. When shown his \ncredit report during his February 2019 background interview, he learned that the bank \nwas seeking to collect $17,002. Applicant disputes the debt and has retained counsel to \nrepresent him. On April 10, 2019, his attorney wrote to the creditor disputing the debt on \ntwo grounds, the improper surcharge for insurance and noncompliance with the Uniform \nCommercial Code in the resale of the vehicle. On May 24, 2019, the lender\u2019s lawyer wrote \nApplicant and stated that the debt was $10,319, much less than the $17,002 and $15,310 \nfigures the creditor reported to the credit bureaus. The creditor then filed a lawsuit. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney represented in a letter addressed to DOHA that the court has ruled \nthat the case presents factual issues requiring a trial, presumably in a ruling denying the \ncreditor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The attorney also writes that a trial date has not \nyet been set. (GE 1 at 6; GE 2 at 32-33; GE 3 at 11; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 3; FORM response \nat 2, 14.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013Credit Account for the Purchase of Furniture Charged-Off in the \nAmount of $1,644 \u2013 In December 2012, Applicant opened this account to purchase \nfurniture. He defaulted on the payments in February 2017. He subsequently entered into \na payment plan with the creditor paying it $89 per month. The debt was fully repaid on \nDecember 31, 2018, as evidenced by a letter from the creditor. (GE 1 at 7; GE 3 at 11.) \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nWhole-Person Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters and four commendations \nrelating to his work for the Army. This evidence strongly supports Applicant, stating he is \na person of good character and integrity, as well as a leader and subject matter expert. \nHis work has made significant contributions to the Army warfighter. Applicant also \nsubmitted similar evidence with his response to the FORM. (GE 3 at 12-17; FORM \nresponse at 5-14.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n\n5 \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR answer, response to the FORM, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n6 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent in early 2017. He has paid two of \nthem, and the third will be resolved in the first quarter of 2020. His behavior three years \nago is not recent or frequent, evidencing that Applicant is living within his means. It is \nunlikely that his past actions will recur, and those debts do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (d) fully apply.  \n \n \nThe fourth delinquent debt arose out of unusual circumstances and is being \ndisputed by Applicant in court. Applicant\u2019s attorney in that litigation has provided \ncorrespondence evidencing his belief that Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthis debt. His counsel asserts Applicant\u2019s defenses to the creditor\u2019s lawsuit in court as an \nofficer of the court. Accordingly, I accept the attorney\u2019s view that Applicant has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of that debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) fully applies.  \n \n \nAside from his counsel\u2019s legal advice in the lawsuit, Applicant has not presented \nany evidence that he has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies, \nhowever, because there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being \nresolved and are under control. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n\n7 \n \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis granted. \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On June 26, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) dated June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On October 17, 2019, the Government moved to amend the \nSOR to include one single allegation under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  Applicant \nresponded to the amended SOR on October 22, 2019.  The case was assigned to me \non November 6, 2019.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \nhearing that same day, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 4, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019. Applicant responded the Amendment and admitted the allegation.  The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered four exhibits at the \nhearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, which were admitted without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 12, 2019. \n \n \n  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Peoples Republic of China (PRC).  Department Counsel provided a ten page \nsummary of the facts, supported by twenty-four Government documents pertaining to \nChina.  The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. (HE-I) They \nare limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are \nset out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 39 years old.  He is married with no children.  He has two Master\u2019s \ndegrees, one in Business, and the other in Data Science.  (Tr. p. 5.)  He is employed \nwith a defense contractor as a Software Engineer.  He is seeking to retain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen.  Both of his parents are from Taiwan.  \nHe grew up here and obtained his education in the United States.  He married a \nChinese woman, who became a naturalized American citizen before he married her.       \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s only contact with China is with his mother and father-in-law, who are \ncitizens and residents of China.  His mother-in-law was a civil engineer who has now \nretired.  His father-in-law worked in the real estate business and he has recently retired.  \nNeither of them speak English.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has never served in the \nChinese military, nor has he worked for the Chinese Government.  Applicant visited his \nin-laws in China as recently as 2018.  His in-laws come to the United States to visit \nApplicant and his wife about once every two years or so.  (Tr. p. 34.)  Any foreign travel \nApplicant does to China or elsewhere, he reports to his company security officer.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an only child.  When her parents pass away, she stands to \ninherit a two bedroom condominium valued at approximately $300,000.  Applicant nor \nhis wife have any assets of any kind in China, including bank accounts.   \n \nAnytime Applicant travels to China he has always informed his security manager \nand follows all security protocol.  Applicant has never been approached, confronted, or \ncontacted by any foreign entity attempting to obtain protected information from him.   \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant states that he is loyal to the U.S. and that his limited relationships with any \nforeign resident of China cannot induct him to do anything against the interests of the \nUnited States.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 46.)   \n \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \n \nIn October 2018, during his security clearance interview with an investigator, \nApplicant admitted that from February 2017 through February 2018, he used marijuana.  \nHe explained that as a result of a left knee injury in June 2012, where he dislocated his \nknee cap, which required surgery, he has continued to have discomfort.  Instead of \nover-the-counter drugs, Applicant chose to use marijuana for relief since it was legalized \nin the state for recreational use.  Applicant stated that in order to purchase marijuana \nfrom a dispensary, he had to obtain a prescription from a doctor first.  He then \npurchased the marijuana he used to soothe his knee discomfort.  Applicant stated that \nhe is aware that marijuana use is still prohibited under Federal law.  He stopped using \nmarijuana before his interview in October 2018, because his medical marijuana card \nwhich allowed him for one year to purchase marijuana from a dispensary had expired \nand he decided not to renew it.  At the time Applicant used marijuana, from February \n2017 through February 2018, he held a security clearance issued by the Department of \nDefense.  Applicant stated that he never asked anyone at work to determine whether he \nshould or should not use marijuana.  He did not report his marijuana use on his security \nclearance application because he did not see it as an issue.  He remembers the last \ntime he used marijuana to have occurred sometime before February 2018.    \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in 2001.  \nOver the years, ownership of the company has changed hands, but the Applicant\u2019s \nemployment has continued.  Applicant is currently a supervisor with over 15 engineers \nworking for him.  He explained that he chose to use marijuana because he was doing it \non his own personal time and not while he was at work.  Applicant expressed that he \nenjoyed the use of marijuana, but felt that by doing a cost/benefit analysis, the cost to \ncontinue using it was too great.  \n \nApplicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated June 14, 2019.  It indicates that \nApplicant has not used marijuana since February 2018.  It also states that Applicant \ndoes not intend to use marijuana in the future and that if he does, his security clearance \nwill be subject to automatic revocation.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \n \nA number of letters of recommendation from his Manager, a Project Manager, \nother professional associates, coworkers, and friends attest to Applicant\u2019s excellent \nwork product, good character, integrity, and loyalty to our country.  Overall, Applicant is \nconsidered to be an invaluable resource to his company.  They all, without hesitation, \nrecommend him for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \nPerformance reviews of the Applicant for the periods from January 2013 through \nJanuary 2018, reflects that he receives \u201chigh marks\u201d and consistently over achieves and \nperforms beyond expectation.  He is also an exceptional team player and has good \nleadership characteristics.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant is an active participant in the community, volunteering for various \ncharity and community outreach events.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n \n \nApplicant has received numerous awards from his employer in recognition of his \nsignificant contributions to the work product.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)   \n \n \nNotice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).   Targeting and collection of US political, military, \neconomic, and technical information by foreign intelligence services continues \nunabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information \nand technology.  China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other \nentities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China \nwho can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable \nmedia devices or e-mail.  Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage.  Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological \nand economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and \npersistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve \nwith continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE I) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n6 \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has only two foreign family members, his mother and father-in-law, who \nare residents and citizens of China.  Applicant maintains very limited contact with them, \nand quite frankly does not speak their language well enough to carry on a conversation.  \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his foreign mother and father-in-law in China may pose a heightened \nsecurity risk for the United States Government.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case.   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent  that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family ties in China raises a prima facie security concern that \nrequired the applicant to \u201cpresent evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.\u201d  Thus, Applicant bears the \nburden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  In this case, Applicant carefully explains that his only family in \nChina are his mother and father-in-law.  Applicant has no regular contact with them.  \nThey know nothing about his job nor do they know that he is applying for a security \nclearance.  Their conversations are minimal, casual, and infrequent at best.  His in-laws \nare not affiliated in any way with any foreign government.  Applicant has no other family \nmembers or friends or associates of any kind in China.   \n \n \nIt is recognized that Applicant is at a higher risk of being targeted for Chinese \nintelligence gathering since he works for a defense contractor.  However, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties are here in the United States.  He is a native-born American citizen, who is \nloyal and dedicated to the American ways.  Although he is married to a woman of \nChinese descent, she is a naturalized American citizen.   Applicant has accomplished \n\n \n7 \n \nhis educational goals, has excelled at work, and has been promoted over the years.  He \nalso volunteers in the community in his free time.  Thus, it can be assumed that he will \ncontinue to place the interest of the U.S. paramount, and always protect the U.S. from \nany risk of terrorism, and/or any situation that could place the interests of the U.S. in \njeopardy.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has met this burden and has established \ntwo mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline B.      \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is not a \nyoung and immature engineer, with little or no experience in the defense industry.  He is \na 37-year-old engineering supervisor, who has worked in the defense industry for the \npast eighteen years, and has held a security clearance most of that time.  He knew or \nshould have known that marijuana use is prohibited by DoD and by anyone who holds a \nsecurity clearance.  To say differently is ludicrous.  Applicant has never told his \nemployers that he has been using marijuana.  Applicant contends that because he had \na prescription for marijuana use, he did not use it illegally.  Applicant is wrong.  \nApplicant was entrusted with the privilege of holding a security clearance and is \nexpected to know and understand the rules and regulations that apply to him as a \nclearance holder.   \n \nWhile holding a security clearance, an individual is held to a higher standard.  \nApplicant admits that he knew that illegal drug use, including the use of marijuana, is \nprohibited in the defense industry.  Furthermore, over the years, Applicant has been \nprivy to numerous security briefings.  Given his long history with the defense industry, \nhe knew or should have known that his use of marijuana, even with a \u201cprescription\u201d is \nprohibited while holding a security clearance.  If nothing more, he should have clarified \nthe matter with his security department, when he started using marijuana in 2017, which \nwould have avoided this situation today.      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n9 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and H in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  However, he \nhas not mitigated the Drug Involvement security concern. \n \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/18/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 2, 2018. \nOn June 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 21, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On December 2, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \n\n \n2 \n \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nDecember 9, 2019, and did not respond. Items 1 through 3 contain the pleadings in the \ncase. Items 4 through 7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 22, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 3), his \nSCA (Item 4), and the summary of his security clearance interview (Item 5). Item 5 was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the FORM a copy of Item 5 \nand a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, then he could be considered to have waived any such objection, \nand Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM or otherwise raise any objections to Item 5. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 57, is married with three adult children. He honorably served in \nthe U.S. Army from 1986 until he retired in 2008. His educational background was not \nspecified in the record. He has been employed as an electronic technician by the same \ndefense contractor since 1997. He was granted a DOD security clearance that same \nyear.  \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant accrued five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $40,000, and that he deliberately failed to disclose one of them on his \nSCA: a $27,647 home-improvement loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant denied each of the \nSOR allegations. However, they were confirmed by his credit reports. The account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. was charged off in March 2015 with a last date of activity in \nAugust 2012. The accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e were placed for collection in \nDecember 2015 and April 2015, respectively; with last dates of activity in November \n2012 and August 2013, respectively. As of March 2019, the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.c. were each approximately 30 days delinquent. (Item 3; Item 6 at 3, 6; Item 7 \nat 1, 2) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan that \nApplicant opened in February 2003 in the amount of $123,036. He initially fell behind \nwith his monthly payments in February 2013. From approximately October 2013 through \nSeptember 2016, the account was 120 days or more delinquent. He became current \nwith his payments in approximately October 2016, apparently due to a loan \nmodification. By March 2019, he had fallen approximately 30 days behind with his \npayments, with a $900 past-due balance. He paid on time from April 2019 through \nOctober 2019, when his account status was \u201cpays as agreed\u201d with no outstanding \nbalance. (AE A at 14-18; Item 6 at 4; Item 7 at 1) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a home-improvement loan that Applicant \nopened in March 2003 in the amount of $31,928. The account was charged off in March \n2015 in the amount of $27,647. There is no information in the record about any \npayments made following the charge off, but the reported balance due is $24,511. (Item \n6 at 3; Item 7 at 2) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is an automobile loan that Applicant opened in \nNovember 2011 in the amount of $30,083. Between April 2015 and April 2019, he fell \n30 days behind in his $740 monthly payment approximately 10 times. In March 2019, \nhis account was approximately 30 days past due with a $9,984 remaining balance. In \nOctober 2019, the account was \u201cpaid and closed\u201d with no remaining balance due. (AE A \nat 31-33; Item 6 at 4; Item 7 at 2) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is an unknown account that was placed for \ncollection in December 2015 with a $1,098 balance. Applicant\u2019s March 2019 credit \nreport notes that he disputed the account information with the credit bureau. However, \nthere was no basis alleged in the record to dispute the legitimacy of the account, nor \nany documentation to establish that the credit bureau changed the delinquent status of \naccount after the dispute. (Item 6 at 3; Item 7 at 2) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit-card account that was placed for \ncollection in April 2015 with a $441 balance. Applicant claimed that the balance resulted \nfrom fraudulent use of his credit card. However, it was reported on his January 2018, \nMarch 2019, and October 2019 credit reports without any reference to a dispute by him. \nHe did not otherwise provide documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged fraud or \nof any actions he took to resolve the issue. (AE A at 45-47; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 6; Item \n7 at 2) \n \nApplicant certified his \u201cno\u201d responses to questions on his SCA about whether he \nhad any financial delinquencies in January 2018. He was interviewed in August 2018 to \ndiscuss, among other matters, financial issues developed during the course of his \nsecurity-clearance investigation. During the interview, Applicant initially reaffirmed that \nhe had no financial problems, was meeting all of his financial obligations, did not have \nany accounts in collections, and was not late on any payments. After being confronted \nwith the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, he stated that he was unaware of them \nand could not provide any information. He reiterated that he took care of all his financial \nobligations. After he was confronted about it, he acknowledged the credit-card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He claimed that the debt related to charges made after the credit \ncard had been stolen 10 years prior. While he averred that he had contacted the bank at \nthe time it was stolen, he neither filed a police report nor had any other documentation \nto corroborate the theft or his communication with the bank. He stated that he would \ncontact the creditor and pay the debt, if necessary. At the conclusion of the interview, \nApplicant reiterated that his overall financial situation was good, he never sought or \nreceived any financial counseling, and he would be more proactive to assure the \naccuracy of his credit report. (Item 5 at 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant did not enumerate his relevant income and expense history or \notherwise explain the circumstances underlying his accumulation of the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. There were no account disputes noted in the \nOctober 2019 credit report Applicant provided with his SOR response. That report did, \nhowever, reveal that he had opened three new auto-loan accounts between May 2019 \nand August 2019 with monthly payments totaling $1,565. (AE A at 19-24, 28-30; Item 2; \nItem 7 at 2) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n5 \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports establish the following disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nSometime after the SOR was issued, Applicant brought the home-mortgage debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a current and resolved the auto-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nHowever, three debts totaling $26,050 remain unresolved. He did not proffer a \nreasonable basis to dispute the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b or 1.d. While he articulated \na reasonable basis to dispute the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, he did not substantiate the \nalleged fraud or provide sufficient evidence of actions he took to resolve the issue.  \n \nExacerbated by his failure to the respond to the FORM, the record contains \ninsufficient detail and documentation to explain not only why Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts occurred, but also why they have persisted, especially since he has been \nemployed full time since 1997. There is no explanation for why his home-mortgage \naccount remained seriously delinquent over a period of nearly three years between \n2013 and 2016, and then became delinquent once again in 2019. Despite his \nunresolved debts, Applicant opened three new auto-loan accounts with monthly \npayments totaling $1,565 between May 2019 and August 2019. While he resolved two \nof the five SOR debts, the record facts do not establish any of the applicable mitigating \nconditions. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an Appellant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time of the omission. (ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2004). An applicant\u2019s level of education and experience are relevant to determining \nwhether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application \nwas deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010)) \n \nI did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations for failing to report the derogatory \nfinancial information on his SCA about which he had to have known. Although the SOR \nalleged that he falsified his SCA only with respect to his failure to disclose the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e were also in a \nreportable delinquent status when he certified his SCA in January 2018. Applicant \nstruggled to make the monthly payments on his mortgage, which remained in serious \ndelinquent status for nearly three years between October 2013 and September 2016 \nuntil he modified his loan. It is not believable that he would not have recalled even one \npart of his delinquent history at the time he completed his SCA. I find substantial \nevidence of an intent by the Applicant to omit security-significant facts from his SCA. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \nNeither of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in \nrequesting a security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the \nhonesty of the applicant. Beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. \nThat compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to \nthe government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002)) \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his known financial delinquencies on his SCA was \nsecurity significant. The fact that he reaffirmed his \u201cno\u201d responses during his security \nclearance interview and only admitted to one debt he claimed resulted from fraudulent \nactivity further undercuts mitigation. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his history of financial delinquencies and deliberate falsification of \nhis SCA. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prepared a substitute 2015 tax \nreturn in April 2017, and a substitute 2016 tax return on June 11, 2018. No tax return \nwas prepared or filed for tax year 2017 by February 18, 2019, the date the 2017 \ntranscript was obtained by the Government. The filing status for the three returns was \nmarried filing separate. (GE 5 at 17-20; Tr. 35) \nApplicant\u2019s documentation reflects that she filed her 2015 federal tax return on \nAugust 12, 2019; her 2016 federal tax return on August 19, 2019; and her 2017 federal \ntax return on December 9, 2019.

(GE 5 at 7; AE B 9-14) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 For tax year 2008, Applicant owes $57,638 to the Federal \nGovernment in delinquent taxes, as of December 31, 2018. A substitute return was \nprepared by the IRS on August 30, 2010. Applicant admitted the allegation and \nindicated she was making $1,800 in monthly payments. She could not explain why the \ndelinquent tax amount was so much, but thought that she was caring for a family \nmember during the year. She rhetorically wondered how she was able to buy her homes \nover the years if she owed so much in delinquent taxes. The documentation shows that \nApplicant initially made fairly regular payments in 2011 on the tax debt under an IRS \ninstallment agreement that was removed later in 2011 after she missed several \npayments. As a result, the IRS imposed periodic penalties and interest. A lien was \nplaced on Applicant\u2019s assets due to the amount of tax owed. She realized her \ninconsistent payment pattern caused the penalties and interest to be levied.

Though she made four monthly \npayments of $1,800 during the period, most of the payments were $750 or less. These \npayments were made by electronic funds transfer of payments (EFT) because there \nwas no official IRS payment plan. When asked in May 2018 why there was no IRS \npayment plan, Applicant surmised the IRS was satisfied in the manner she was making \nher payments. The total of Applicant\u2019s 11 payments from November 2018 to February \n2020 through ETF was $10,950. (Applicant\u2019s earlier payments from 2011 through the \nend of October 2018 have already been subtracted from the delinquent tax amount \ndisplayed on the 2008 account transcript.)

(GE 5 at 5-6; Tr. 40-41; AE B at 4-5; AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d - For tax year 2010, Applicant owes $2,376 to the Federal \nGovernment in delinquent taxes, as of February 18, 2019. Applicant filed her 2010 \nfederal return on August 27, 2014. Her documentation indicates that at least part of the \ndelinquent tax was removed in March 2016 with the release of a $1,047 tax lien for tax \nyear 2010.

No additional evidence \nwas presented on the status of the lien or her 2008 and 2009 proposed IRS payment \nplan. (GE 3 at 5; GE 6 at 7; Tr. 44-45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i \u2013 Applicant failed to file state tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017. In \nher October 2019 response to the SOR, she indicated the state returns were filed, but \nshe did not have the documentation in her possession at the February 2020 hearing. \nShe indicated that she owed the state tax agency $9,000 in delinquent taxes for 2014, \nbut the amount was being reevaluated. She indicated she was paying the state tax \nagency $400 a month under a payment plan. (Evidence regarding her claim of \ndelinquent state taxes and the presence of a payment plan will be addressed in the \nwhole-person concept below.) Following the hearing, those returns were entered into \nevidence. The state returns for 2014 and 2015 display Applicant\u2019s income with \nadjustments. The state returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018 display only exemptions. \nApplicant surmised that the difference in information inside the returns was due to a \nformat change in the tax application she used to prepare the returns. Also, she was a \npart-time resident of one state when she moved to another in 2014. (Tr. 45-46, 94-95; \nAE D; AE F at 4) \nApplicant testified that she has had financial counseling throughout her \nprofessional career. The format for the counseling was that she would talk about her \nfinances and taxes with a counselor. The counseling she had in 2015 was directed \nmore toward managing her finances and less on tax issues. (Tr. 51,102) \nOn March 3, 2020, by facsimile, Applicant requested account transcripts for 2008 \nand 2009 from the IRS.

The firm \ndiscovered that her 2014 through 2018 federal and state tax returns were not processed \nproperly and are being amended. According to her undocumented claim, she only owes \n$2,626 in delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2014. Her unsupported claims that she \nmay not owe $6,481 in state taxes for tax year 2014, and that she is paying the state tax \nagency either $400 or $321 a month, will be addressed in the whole-person section of \nthis decision. \nIn an email appearing at AE F at 2-3 (March 31, 2020), Applicant reviewed the \npost-hearing evidence she had submitted and other documentation she intended to \nsubmit. Though she mentioned that she intended to submit monthly budget information, \nthe record contains no evidence of a budget. She also indicated in the March 31, 2020 \nemail that on March 3, 2020, an IRS official informed her by telephone that the \ndelinquent federal taxes for tax year 2008 are $51,288 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and for tax year \n2009 are $32,796 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Finally, without supporting documentation, Applicant \nstated that she was paying IRS $1,500 a month on her delinquent federal taxes for tax \nyears 2008 and 2009, and her tax firm was helping her file her 2019 federal tax return \non time. (AE F at 2-3) No additional post-hearing documentation was presented by \nApplicant by May 22, 2020, the date when the record closed. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate that she has good judgment and is trustworthy. A yardstick of her judgment \nand trustworthiness is how she manages her personal financial affairs. An applicant \nwho has a history of not filing her tax returns and paying her taxes demonstrates \nfinancial irresponsibility. If she shows that she has trouble complying with the legal \nrequirements of filing her tax returns and paying her taxes, there is a risk that she may \nexhibit the same kind of irresponsible attitude when it comes to following security rules \nand regulations for safeguarding sensitive and classified information. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant admittedly failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns for 2015, \n2016, and 2017. She acknowledged that she owes delinquent federal taxes totaling \n$138,439, for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015. She admitted that a \nfederal tax lien amounting to $94,689 was entered against her in 2011 for tax years \n2008 and 2009. Applicant\u2019s 12-year history of not complying with her legal tax \nobligations establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided documentation showing that she paid her delinquent federal \ntaxes for 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and for 2011 (SOR 1.e) She has mitigated those allegations. \nSince the tax lien was filed in 2011 for federal taxes she owes for tax year 2008 and \n2009, which she admitted, I find in her favor under SOR \u00b6 1.h. She also paid off federal \ntaxes she owed for tax year 2013. (unalleged) Though she has made periodic payments \ninside and outside of IRS payment plans on the delinquent balance for federal tax years \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), she still \nowes $102,068 in delinquent taxes for those years. Applicant has provided insufficient \nevidence to show that the tax issues will not persist in the future. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in \npart. \nApplicant and members of her family had serious medical problems since 1994. \nHer unforeseen medical problems, the unanticipated and commendable care she \nprovided to her sister and her mother, and at least part of the burial expense associated \nwith their deaths, were clearly events beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, apart from \nthe emotional toll on her, it is difficult to establish the extent to which these family \nmedical events interfered with her failure to timely file her federal and state tax returns \nand pay her federal and state taxes. The second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), acting \nresponsibly under the circumstances, is only partially applicable because Applicant has \nnot presented a meaningful track record of debt reduction through regular payment of \nher delinquent taxes, given her prior erratic history in filing federal and state tax returns \nand failing to comply with IRS payment plans over the years. \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant testified that her tax issues arose even before 2008, however, she did \nnot hire a tax consultant until late 2019 or 2020 because she did not trust the service \nand she believed she could resolve the tax issues by making payments. Regarding her \nlengthy delay in obtaining assistance, she receives no mitigation under either prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) because her decision was totally within her control, leading to mounting tax \nproblems beginning in tax year 2008. Significantly, her decision to finally hire the tax \nservice did not occur until after she received the SOR in late 2019. \nWhile Applicant claimed that she has had financial counseling throughout her \ncareer, she only mentioned the 2015 counseling that recommended she pay her taxes. \nFurthermore, despite her intentions to supply a financial budget among her post-hearing \nexhibits, no budget was received. Even though there are still insufficient indicators that \nher tax issues are being resolved, she merits partial consideration under AG \u00b6 20(c) for \nhiring the tax firm and becoming more proactive in the resolution of her tax difficulties. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d), an applicant must demonstrate a good-faith effort to handle \nher financial obligations. Under AG \u00b6 20(g), an applicant must show that she has made \narrangements with the federal and state tax authorities that she is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. Applicant receives limited mitigation under both conditions \nbecause there is negligible evidence from her showing voluntary compliance with \nfederal and state tax laws in filing returns and paying her taxes since 2008. Though \nApplicant eventually filed the missing federal and state tax returns, the late filing of \nthose returns reduces the mitigation available under AG \u00b6 20(g). Applicant still owes \ndelinquent federal taxes for 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the specific \ncondition together with all the surrounding circumstances of this case. I have considered \nthe serious medical issues that Applicant and her family faced over the years. In 2004 \nor 2005, Applicant decided to become a consultant without investigating the tax \nramifications of reporting income, filing returns and paying taxes for a consultant. The \ntax problems escalated in 2008 and liens were ultimately filed for nonpayment of taxes \nfor 2008 and subsequent years. Instead of obtaining help for her ballooning tax \nproblems, she let the situation fester because she did not trust tax services. After hiring \na tax firm in late 2019, they indicated her federal and state tax returns for 2014 through \n2018 were processed improperly, and that they were working toward a resolution of \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues. However, she presented no documentary evidence to support \nher claims regarding the tax information her tax firm uncovered about the current status \nof her federal and state taxes, and the status and duration of the payment plan she was \nparticipating in with the state tax agency. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nspecifically Applicant\u2019s history of filing late tax returns and her inconsistent payment \nplan history in previous IRS payment plans and through EFT, Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant initially answered the SOR in writing on June 28, 2019 (Answer-1), and \nasked that his case be decided on the written record. On August 16, 2019, he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge and filed Answer-2. On September 24, 2019, he \nfiled additional information pertinent to his answers, which I referenced as Answer-3. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on December \n18, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 21, 2020, setting the hearing for \nFebruary 13, 2020. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 \ninto evidence. Applicant testified. He did not offer any exhibits or object to the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, and they were admitted into the record. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 24, 2020.  \n \nProcedural Matters: \n \n \nPrior to the commencement of the case, Department Counsel corrected SOR \u00b6 1.b \nto note that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2003, and not a Chapter \n13. (Tr. 8) \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also withdrew the following allegations from the SOR: \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \n1.k, 1.n, and 1.o. (Tr. 8) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the Guideline F allegations contained in the SOR that \nremained after the Government\u2019s withdrawal of the four mentioned above, except those \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.i, and 1.q, which he denied. (Tr. 10) He denied the Guideline E allegation. \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He served in the Navy from 1986 to 2006, when he retired \nand received an honorable discharge as an E-5. He and his first wife were married 24 \nyears and divorced. They have four adult children. He has been married to his second \nwife for four years. He does not have any children with her. He has three young \ngrandchildren, who live with him and his second wife. In January 2017, he began his \ncurrent contractor position with the Navy. (Tr. 18-20)  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, dating back to when he was in the \nNavy and applying for a security clearance. During a background interview in January \n2004 with a government investigator, he discussed his 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which \nhe filed to dispose of his debts and avoid a wage garnishment. (GE 4) Subsequently, he \nwas not granted a security clearance. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nOn December 12, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In it, he disclosed a 2014 bankruptcy and a delinquent \nloan. After filing his e-QIP, Applicant was interviewed in June 2018 by a government \ninvestigator. During the background interview, Applicant was confronted with additional \nfinancial delinquencies listed on a February 2017 credit bureau report (CBR), including  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nmany debts which were owed to credit card companies. He addressed all of the \ninvestigator\u2019s inquiries. He said he had closed many of the credit card accounts. (GE 7)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he and his first wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003. \nHis wife was not working at time, and he did not earn enough money to support her and \ntheir four children. According to the bankruptcy documents, he discharged over $32,500 \nof debt, which consisted of primarily retail and credit card accounts. (Tr. 23; GE 4, GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he filed his 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a consequence \nof his divorce from his first wife in 2011. He was still paying child support then and earning \na small salary. He thinks the court discharged approximately $28,000 of delinquent debts \nin that bankruptcy, which included retail and credit card accounts. (Tr. 23-24: GE 5) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his present financial problems to several factors: periods of \nunemployment, including four months before he started his current position; his 2011 \ndivorce from his first wife; providing support for his stepdaughter; and two moves in seven \nmonths to accommodate three grandchildren, whom he supports. (Tr. 11-12, 21; Answer \n-2) After discharging delinquent debts in his 2014 bankruptcy, Applicant said he opened \nnew credit card accounts and used them to pay bills. When the payments on the cards \nbecame due, he was unable to pay them. He acknowledged that he made a poor decision \nin opening those accounts. (Tr. 24-25) \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from February \n2017 and May 2019, the SOR alleged: two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, in 2003 and 2014; \ntwo charged-off automobile loans; and ten delinquent debts, including credit cards. The \nautomobile loans and other debts became delinquent between 2014 and 2018, and \ntotaled $23,325. (GE 2, GE 3) None of the 12 debts alleged in the SOR have been \nresolved. (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant contacted some creditors in the past, but does not have any current \npayment plans. He said he cancelled many of the cards and no longer uses them. (Tr. \n24-25) \n \n \nApplicant does not have a written budget. His net monthly salary income is about \n$3,000. He also receives $1,500 a month from his military retirement and $1,600 a month \nas a VA disability benefit. His wife\u2019s monthly income is $2,400. She uses her salary to \nsupport her 36-year-old developmentally disabled daughter, who lives independently. He \nhas not sought financial counseling since 2014, when he filed bankruptcy. Appellant\u2019s \nwife is not involved in managing their household finances. (Tr. 43, 45-46, 61-62) \n \n \nApplicant said his financial situation has improved since his first wife died in 2018. \nHe no longer pays her part of his military retirement, and his child support payments have \nstopped as all of his children have reached their majority. He said he has an extra $1,350 \nafter paying his bills. (Tr. 24, 46)  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn response to question Section 26: Financial Record of his e-QIP, Applicant \ndisclosed that he filed bankruptcy in 2014 and had a delinquent loan. He did not disclose \nany other delinquent debts or the charged-off accounts alleged in the SOR. (GE 1) He \ntestified that he did not read the questions carefully before he answered them. He knew \nhe had some indebtedness. He said the computer he was using was old and not working \nwell. Some of the alleged debts were not delinquent at the time he submitted the SOR, \nas noted in the summary of his interview. He testified that he did not attempt to deceive \nthe Government by failing to disclose all of his delinquent debts. (Tr. 55-57; GE 1, GE 7) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. Two may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nSince prior to 2003, Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he has been \nunable to resolve. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003 and in 2014, and had debts \ndischarged. He continued to accumulate delinquent debts after discharging debts in his \nJune 2014 bankruptcy. The evidence raises the above trustworthiness concerns, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could potentially mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant discharged delinquent debts in 2003 and 2014 through bankruptcy. He \naccumulated 12 delinquent debts since his last bankruptcy, which are ongoing, \nunresolved, and continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not \napply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed some of his current delinquent debts to periods of \nunemployment, including prior to starting his current position with the Navy; the \nconsequences of his divorce; and providing support to family members. Those may have \nbeen circumstances beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that he attempted to responsibly manage his debts as they were \naccumulating, or evidence of actions he may have taken after each bankruptcy to ensure \nhe managed his finances responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies partially. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has participated in credit or financial \ncounseling since 2014. He has not established a written budget to show responsible \nfinancial management. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there are clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. \n  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve any of \nthe 12 delinquent debts, or substantiate actions taken to dispute any of the debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(e) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the trustworthiness concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he failed to disclose all of his delinquent debts in his \n2016 e-QIP, but denied that he attempted to intentionally mislead the Government. He \ndid disclose his 2014 bankruptcy and a delinquent loan. During his 2018 background \ninterview, he answered all questions related to his finances. He testified that he had \ntrouble completing the e-QIP because he was using an old computer. He also noted that \nsome debts were not delinquent at the time he submitted the e-QIP. After listening to his \ntestimony, reviewing his disclosure of some negative information in the e-QIP and the \ncase file, I do not believe that he deliberately concealed financial information from DOD. \nHis omissions may have been careless, but not intentional. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. \nPersonal conduct trustworthiness concerns are concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, eligibility, and suitability for a position of trust. Based on his long history of \nfinancial problems and the lack of an established track record of responsible financial \nmanagement, he failed to meet his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. He refuted those concerns raised under \nthe personal conduct guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n               AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n    \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.d:               Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.e: \n \n \n \n   Withdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.f-1.j: \n \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.k: \n \n \n    Withdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs:  1.l-1.m:  \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs:  1.n-1.o:  \n \n   Withdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs:  1.p-1.r: \n \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n                Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n \n          FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n                         For Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 10, 2019 SOR, Applicant owed $35,459 in delinquent consumer-credit debt on ten accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.j, and 1.m) and $2,729 in medical collection debt on six accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.k-1.l, and 1.n-1.p). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that the debts are legitimate and attributed them to having only his income in the household to pay medical expenses (including for ambulance and emergency room services) incurred by his spouse and son and living expenses. He added that he was unsuccessful in negotiating affordable payment plans with his creditors. (Item 2.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 63-year-old inspector with a defense contractor. He has worked for his employer since February 1984 and holds a secret clearance. He and his spouse married in March 2005, and they have an 11-year-old son. (Item 3.) On May 5, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he was currently utilizing or seeking assistance from a credit counseling service or similar resource to resolve financial difficulties.

While unexpected medical expenses may have caused \nor contributed to his financial problems, he has made little progress toward resolving his \npast-due balances. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn August 14, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 5, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items \n1-6). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM \nto Applicant and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on September 10, 2019. No response was received by the \nOctober 10, 2019 deadline. On November 22, 2019, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on December 5, 2019.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 4, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on September 20, 2018. The summary report was \npart of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows:  \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR APPLICANT \u2013 Applicant was not given an \nopportunity to review and authenticate this summary document (Item 4) \nprior to issuance of the SOR. The Government acknowledges that, \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of Enclosure 3 of Directive 5220.6, Applicant can object \nto its admissibility on this ground. The Government also recognizes \nthat some of the information contained there in may not be entirely \ncorrect, or up to date. Applicant is therefore free to correct, revise or \nupdate the information in any Response to this filing, as well as to pose \nan objection to its admissibility. Moreover, while Applicant\u2019s interview \nmay add some details regarding his conduct, all facts alleged in the \nSOR are also proven and discussed elsewhere in this FORM. \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. Concerning whether Applicant understood \nthe meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se \nstatus does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond those afforded him if \nhe was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he \nmay request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting \n\n3 \n \nevidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department \nCounsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a waiver of \nthe authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity \nto object to the admissibility of the interview summary report, to comment on the interview \nsummary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the \nreport. In the absence of any objections, I accepted Item 4 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the June 10, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed $35,459 in delinquent consumer-credit debt on ten accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.j, \nand 1.m) and $2,729 in medical collection debt on six accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.k-1.l, and \n1.n-1.p). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that the debts are \nlegitimate and attributed them to having only his income in the household to pay medical \nexpenses (including for ambulance and emergency room services) incurred  by his spouse \nand son and living expenses. He added that he was unsuccessful in negotiating affordable \npayment plans with his creditors. (Item 2.) \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), \nI make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old inspector with a defense contractor. He has worked for his \nemployer since February 1984 and holds a secret clearance. He and his spouse married in \nMarch 2005, and they have an 11-year-old son. (Item 3.) \n \nOn May 5, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an \ninquiry concerning whether he was currently utilizing or seeking assistance from a credit \ncounseling service or similar resource to resolve financial difficulties. He indicated that he \nhad fallen behind on credit-card debt and that he had \u201cjust started\u201d working with a credit \nresolution company. He also answered \u201cYes\u201d to inquiries regarding delinquency involving \nroutine accounts and disclosed that he had seven credit-card debts and four medical bills \ntotaling $38,424 for which he is legally liable and stated, \u201cMy son has had medical \nconditions since 2012 that has [sic] caused me to fall behind in my financial obligations.\u201d \nConcerning actions taken to resolve these debts, Applicant explained that he was in \ncontact with an agency recommended by his employer through its Employee Assistance \nProgram for assistance in consolidating his debts and creating a financially responsible \nplan to pay off his debts. (Item 3.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 26, 2016, revealed several credit-card and \nmedical-account delinquencies. A credit-card account with a $14,900 credit limit was \ncharged off for $15,987 in July 2014, after inactivity since November 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A \ncredit-card account with a $5,000 credit limit had been in collection for $5,653 for at least \ntwo years as of July 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A credit-card account, opened with a toy retailer in \n\n4 \n \nJuly 2013, was placed for collection in August 2014 after nonpayment since January 2014. \nAs of July 2016, the collection balance was $2,261 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). A credit-card debt of \n$1,822 from August 2013 was assigned for collection in April 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). A credit-\ncard account, opened in April 2012, was placed for collection in August 2014 for $1,185 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). A credit-card account with a retailer, opened in November 2013, was placed \nfor collection for $884 in June 2015 after inactivity since February 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nAnother credit-card account with a retailer, opened in March 2012 with a $500 credit limit, \nwas charged off for $714 in August 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). A $637 credit-card debt was in \ncollection after no activity since August 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant was an authorized user \non the account. A store credit card, obtained in October 2009, became past due and was \ncharged off for $606 in November 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). A $5,139 credit-card judgment was \nentered against Applicant in October 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). As of July 2016, Applicant also \nowed medical collection debts of $1,570 from November 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $111 from \nApril 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); $408 from September 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.n); $377 from February 2013 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.o); and $211 from December 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). (Item 5.) \n \nOn September 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He stated that he had contacted a debt \nresolution company about one month prior to completing his May 2016 SF 86, and that he \nwas advised to file a bankruptcy petition and seek advice from an attorney. He did neither \nand had no further contact with the company. Applicant admitted that he was not currently \nutilizing or seeking assistance from a credit counseling service or similar resource to \nresolve his financial difficulties. Applicant did not dispute the judgment debt on his record \nbut indicated that it had been incurred by his spouse. He acknowledged that he was \nresponsible for the debts incurred by his spouse using his credit. When asked to detail his \ndebts, he provided information from a September 17, 2018 credit report which confirmed \nseveral of the delinquent accounts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.f-1.j, and 1.m).  Applicant \nstated that his financial problems began in 2010 or 2011 because of insufficient income \nand medical expenses for his son, who has a neurological disorder, and that he used credit \ncards for day-to-day living expenses. Applicant disputed the medical collection debts on his \nrecord and some of the credit entries that he did not recognize. He explained that he had \nmade no attempt to make payments on his delinquencies because he has only had enough \nmoney to pay his mortgage and his taxes. He denied any use of any credit cards since \n2014, stating that he uses cash for purchases. He expressed a long term plan to pay off his \ndelinquent debt once his mortgage loan is satisfied in a few years. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator on September 27, 2018. After \nchecking his financial record, he no longer disputed any of the debts on the SOR. He \nacknowledged that he had incurred the credit-card debt that went to judgment (SOR \u00b6 \n1.m). As for his plans to address his past-due debts, Applicant related that his mortgage \nwould be paid off in four years, and his spouse\u2019s car would be paid off in three to four \nyears. At that time, he would have the income to make payments on his delinquent debts if \nhis creditors were willing to work with him. (Item 4.) \n \nAs of April 2019, Equifax was reporting delinquent debts totaling $37,154 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.m) on Applicant\u2019s credit record. He has no new credit-card debt on his record. \n\n5 \n \nApplicant was reportedly making timely payments of $805 per month on his mortgage with \na $30,519 balance and $409 per month on an automobile loan obtained for $29,978 in July \n2013. The balance of the car loan was $6,822. (Item 6.) \n \nOn June 10, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his \nunresolved credit-card debts. (Item 1.) In his August 14, 2019 response, Applicant cited as \ncauses for his legitimate debts medical bills for his wife and son; only his income in the \nhousehold; utility bills, property taxes and food; and unexpected emergency room and \nambulance expenses. Applicant explained that he tried to negotiate workable payment \nplans with creditors without success. (Item 2.) He provided no details or specifics about his \nincome or expenses.  \n  \nIn the September 5, 2019 FORM, Applicant was placed on notice of the \nGovernment\u2019s concern about his failure to provide any documentary evidence to show that \nhe acted responsibly toward his creditors or that he has any repayment plans in place for \nhis debts. In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant had an opportunity to provide information of \nmedical bills and other expenses; of his current income; and of contacts with creditors \nabout affordable repayment terms for his debts. There is no indication that he responded \nby the October 10, 2019 deadline. \n                                                                                                                                                \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n6 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n\n7 \n \nApplicant starting having serious financial difficulties in 2013. Over the next two to \nthree years, nine of his credit-card accounts were charged off or placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.h, 1.j, and 1.m), and he defaulted on six medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.k-\n1.l, and 1.n-1.p). Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. Another credit-card debt of $637 from \nAugust 2012 was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.1.i). The account remains on his credit \nrecord, but as an authorized user, he is not legally responsible for repayment. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant explained that he experienced financial difficulties because of out-of-\npocket medical expenses for his son and spouse, when he is the only income provider for \nthe household. Ambulance and emergency room expenses are unexpected, but it is \nunclear in the record whether they resulted from a circumstance that is unlikely to recur or \nfrom an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness or chronic condition. Even if the medical \nexpenses were incurred under a unique circumstance of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 \n20(a), Applicant benefitted from the consumer credit extended to him, and he has yet to \nmake any payments toward the consumer-credit delinquencies alleged in the SOR, which \nbecame seriously past due between 2013 and 2015. The debts are considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \n\n8 \n \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nAn unexpected medical emergency is a situation that implicates AG \u00b6 20(b). Even \nassuming that the medical debts in the SOR were incurred because of circumstances \noutside of his control, several of Applicant\u2019s unpaid delinquencies are owed to retailers. \nApplicant presented no evidence showing that the consumer-credit charges were incurred \nfor necessities rather than discretionary purchases. Moreover, I have to consider whether \nApplicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR \nCase No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). During his OPM interviews in \nSeptember 2018, Applicant indicated that he lacked the income to make payments on his \nold delinquencies, but that he would address them once he pays off his mortgage and the \nloan for his spouse\u2019s vehicle in a few years.  Available credit records show that he makes \nhis loan payments on time, and housing and transportation are understandable financial \npriorities.  Nevertheless, his ongoing disregard of a court judgment for the credit-card debt \ncasts doubt upon whether he can be counted on to comply with rules and regulations that \nmay not be in his self-interest or a priority for him. He indicated in response to the SOR that \nhe tried to negotiate \u201ca workable payment\u201d with his creditors, but he provided no details \nand lacks corroboration of any such efforts. It is difficult to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly when there is scant detail in the record about his income and expenses. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) was not fully established. \n \n \nAs of April 2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed no progress toward addressing his \nconsumer-credit delinquencies. He has had ample opportunity to provide evidence of \nactions taken, if any, to make payments on his delinquent consumer credit debts, and he \nsubmitted no evidence of any payments. There is no evidence that he has had financial \ncounseling. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(b) can reasonably apply in mitigation. The \nAppeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No, \n09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). AG \u00b6 20(e) applies in that Applicant, as an \nauthorized user, is not legally liable for repayment of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, although the \nfunds to repay that debt may have to come from his income. AG \u00b6 20(e) was not shown to \napply to any of the other past-due debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \n\n9 \n \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \nhistory of outstanding delinquent debt. Applicant has shown some financial reform by no \nlonger relying on consumer credit and instead paying in cash for purchases. Whether due \nto little improvement in his financial situation over the last five years, to a lack of \ncommitment to fulfilling his obligations to his creditors, or to a combination of these or other \nfactors, Applicant has not demonstrated the sound financial judgment expected of a person \nwith eligibility for classified access. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",
