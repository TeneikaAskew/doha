HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nHenry L. Young, Lay Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant drinks beer regularly. He pled guilty to a driving under the influence charge in\n2004, his first alcohol-related offense. As a condition for receiving a restricted license, he attended\nan alcohol and substance abuse program, which he successfully completed. The record does not\ncontain a credible medical report from a qualified medical professional or licensed clinical social\nworker which diagnosed alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Applicant mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns about his alcohol consumption. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nUpon review of the hearing transcript, it appears that one government exhibit and two Applicant exhibits were\n1\nreceived and marked, but not formally admitted into evidence. Since there were no objections to the admission of these\nexhibits at the hearing, the exhibits are admitted into the record.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated August 23, 2007, at 1-2.\n2\nId.\n3\nGE 1 (Security clearance application) at 1, 4-5; Tr. at 32-34.\n4\n2\nOn August 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On August 23, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He\nrequested a hearing. \nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 19, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2007. Due to a personal emergency, DOHA reassigned\nthis case to me on October 10, 2007. I held a hearing on October 17, 2007. The government\nsubmitted seven exhibits (GE), which were marked and admitted into evidence as GE 1-7. Applicant\nsubmitted nine documents, which were marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant exhibits\n(AE) A-I.  I held the record open until November 16, 2007 for the submission of additional evidence.\n1\nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 31, 2007. Applicant submitted three additional\ndocuments, which were marked and admitted into evidence as AE J-L without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation under Guideline G, subparagraph 1.d and admitted in part\nand denied in part the allegation in subparagraph 1.b of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated\n2\nas findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegations.  After a complete review of the evidence\n3\nin the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 57 years old. He began working for his current employer, a Department of\nDefense contractor, in August 1971. He currently works as a shipfitter foreman. He has 36 years of\ncontinuous service with his employer. He has held a security clearance since 1984 or 1985, without\nany violations for failure to follow security procedures. He completed his renewal security clearance\napplication (SF-86) on March 28, 2006.4\n\nGE 1, supra note 4, at 6-9, 11-12; Tr. at 32, 34.\n5\nAE J (Letter, dated November 11, 2007); Tr. at 58-64.\n6\nGE 3 (Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal records report, dated June 7, 2004);\n7\nGE 4 (Court docket sheet); Tr. at 39-42, 44, 47, 68-69.\nTr. at 38, 42, 44, 67.\n8\n3\nApplicant married in 1969. He graduated high school in 1970. He and his first wife divorced\nin 1984. He married his current wife in 1984. He has three children, a daughter now 37 years old and\ntwo sons, ages 33 and 32.5\nSince beginning his employment, his employer has required him to get a physical at its health\nclinic as part of its program for monitoring for lead poisoning. From 1971 until 1985, these physical\nexaminations occurred every 90 days, and included a blood pressure check, a review of fingers and\ngums (if the gums were turning purple, it was a sign of lead poisoning), a hand strength, and blood\nand urine testing. After 1985, the physical examinations and testing took place twice a year, and a\ncomplete physical examination is conducted once a year. His test results have always been negative\nfor any serious problems. In March 2007, his urine test showed blood in his urine, but in August\n2007, his urine test results were normal. The clinic at his work site refused to provide him with a\ncopy of his medical records.6\nApplicant began drinking beer around age 22 or 23. In June 2004, Applicant attended a\nfamily picnic, where he drank beer from early afternoon until about an hour before his departure. On\nhis way home, the police arrested and charged him with driving under the influence (DUI) after his\nbreathalyzer results showed a 13% level of alcohol. Applicant had never received a ticket for DUI\nprior to this date. He pled guilty. The court sentenced him as a first time offender to 30 days in jail,\nsuspended, fined him $300, $100 suspended, and restricted his driving privileges for one year,\ncontingent upon his participation in an alcohol and substance abuse program.  \n7\nAs directed, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol and substance abuse program. He started\nattending the program in October 2004 after his initial one-on-one 45 minute interview with the\nprogram director. He completed six months of weekly group counseling in April 2005 and attended\n52 sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) before he completed the program in September 2005.\nDuring his time in this program, he did not drink alcohol. At no time did any counselor advise him\nnot to drink alcohol in the future. The record contains no clinical reports from this program.8\nSince 2005, Applicant has continued to drink beer on the weekends. He usually consumes\nthree to four beers at one time, sometimes when watching a game. He does not drink wine and will\noccasionally drink a mixed drink when out. In the summer, he may drink one or two beers in the\nevening. He may not drink anything for a week or more. Since completing the alcohol program, he\nwill not drive if he drinks two beers at home. He has not experienced any blackouts as a result of his\ndrinking. He does not drink in the morning. His work attendance record for the last seven years\nindicates that he regularly arrives at work on time and does not miss work on a regular basis because\nof unexcused absences or health reasons. This record supports his statement that he has not missed\n\nId. at 39, 47-48, 51-52, 69-75; AE A ( Attendance record).\n9\nTr. at 48-49.\n10\nGE 5 (Counseling report, dated May 12, 2007). In this report the Director stated that this test shows alcohol\n11\nuse within 80 hours of the test.\nId. According to the Director, blood in the urine maybe indicative of liver damage.\n12\nAE H (Copy of counselor\u2019s business card); AE I (Information sheet on counseling).\n13\nAE K (Medical report, dated June 13, 2005); AE L (Medical report, dated November 6, 2007); Tr. at 90-91.\n14\n4\nwork because of alcohol usage. He denies an alcohol problem. His supervisor has never sent him to\nthe clinic because of alcohol use.9\nAfter completing his SF-86, he returned to the same alcohol and substance abuse program\nfor an evaluation at the request of his security office. He met with the same director in May 2007 for\napproximately 45 minutes and provided her with a urine sample. At the hearing, he admitted that he\nhad not be truthful with her about when he last consumed alcohol. He told he had not consumed\nalcohol in one month, when it had been two days.10\nThe Director, who is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Marital and Family\nTherapist (LNFT) and Licensed Substance Abuse Treatment Practioner (LSATP), prepared a written\nreport on this interview and the one urine test result. Based on the positive ethylglucuronide\nreading,  his statement that there was blood in his urine test at work in March 2007,  treatment\n11\n12\nhistory (without any further information), and his lack of honesty in self-reporting his alcohol use,\nthe Director recommended an intensive treatment program of at least six months after a complete\nmedical evaluation and liver enzyme testing program. In a supplemental report, the Director stated\nthat Applicant\u2019s diagnosis after the May 2007 interview was Alcohol Dependence 303.90 (with\ntolerance). The supplemental report reflects that the diagnosis is based on his urine test results.\nApplicant has not followed up with the recommended treatment. He, however, consulted with a\nprofessional counselor about an evaluation. The counselor advised that it would take four or five\nsessions at least to provide an evaluation.13\nIn August 2007, Applicant underwent his six-month lead poisoning physical examination,\nwith normal testing results. In June 2005 and in November 2007, his private physician examined\nhim, and directed routine blood and urinalysis tests. The June 2005 report does not indicate any\nabnormal test results.14\nThe government entered into evidence pages 175-181 and 195-196 from the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), which reviews the criteria for\ndiagnosing substance-related disorders. The DSM-IV, page 176-179, defines substance dependence\nas a cluster of three or more of the symptoms listed below occurring at any time in the same 12-\nmonth period. The symptoms include tolerance; withdrawal; drinking beyond the limit set for\nconsuming alcohol; unsuccessful efforts at decreasing or discontinuing use of alcohol after persistent\nexpression to do so; spending a great deal of time obtaining alcohol, using alcohol or recovering\nfrom the effects of the alcohol; daily activities resolve around alcohol use; and continued use of\n\nGE 7.\n15\nAE B (Letter, dated October 8, 2007; AE C (2007 Performance Feedback, dated October 1, 2007); AE G\n16\n(Credit report, dated October 3, 2007).\nAE D (Disciplinary guidelines); AE E (Copy of relevant labor agreement provisions).\n17\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n18\n5\nalcohol after recognizing the contributing role of the substance to a psychological or physical\nproblem. The key issue in evaluating this criterion is not the existence of a problem, but rather the\nfailure to abstain from using alcohol despite having evidence of the difficulties it is causing. The\nDSM-IV, page 179, states that \u201cwith physiological dependence\u201d should be used when substance\ndependence is accompanied by evidence of tolerance and withdrawal. A similar statement is made\nconcerning alcohol dependence on page 195.15\nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation by his current supervisor rated him at 4, the\nhighest rating available. His supervisor from late 2004 until early 2007 describes Applicant as an a\ndependable and excellent employee with excellent attendance. Applicant\u2019s recent credit report\nreflects that his bills are paid in a timely manner and his finances are well managed.16\nThe labor agreement between Applicant\u2019s employer and the union representing employees\noutlines the policy for alcohol use during work hours and the criteria under which the employer may\ntest for alcohol use. His employer\u2019s disciplinary guidelines provide for immediate discharge if\nalcohol is used on the job or an employee reports to work under the influence of alcohol, subject to\nthe terms of the union contract which does allow for one period of rehabilitation before discharge.17\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.18\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n19\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n20\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n19\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n20\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n21\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n22\nclearance decision.23\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n24\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n25\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n26\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n27\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nAlcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21) In 2004, the police arrested and charged Applicant with DUI, which\nresulted in a guilty plea. Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from\n\n7\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent applies.\nApplicant began drinking beer in his early twenties, over 30 years ago. He has received one\nDUI during this period of time. He has not had any other alcohol related incidents at work or outside\nof work. Given his DUI in 2004 was his only alcohol-related incident, it does not cast doubt on his\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nAlthough the government argues for the application of DC \u00b6 22(d) diagnosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse\nor alcohol dependence and DC \u00b6 22(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\nI find that neither apply. In September 2007, the Director of the alcohol and substance abuse program\nhe attended for one year, beginning in October 2004, diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent,\nciting to code 303.90 of the DSM-IV even though she is not a qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed social worker. She based her diagnosis on one urine test result, a 45-minute interview, and\na statement from Applicant he had blood in his urine on one occasion. She did not make this\ndiagnosis using the recommended standards and criteria set forth in the DSM-IV for such a\ndiagnosis. She provided no information in her report as to her understanding of Applicant\u2019s current\nalcohol use, alcohol tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or history of alcohol use. Her report does not\nreference his earlier treatment in her program, any prior diagnosis, any prior recommendations to\nabstain from drinking alcohol, or any previous prognosis. Her report fails to provide a proper\nanalytical basis for her ultimate conclusion that Applicant is alcohol dependent. Thus, I find her\ndiagnosis and report lacking in credibility because it is not supported by underlying documentation\nand a proper analysis.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant began drinking beer as a young man and continues to drink beer on a regular basis.\nHe denies drinking to excess and impairment, a denial which is support by the record evidence as\na whole. His work attendance is excellent. His most recent work evaluation is at the highest level\nand his bills are paid in a timely manner. If he had a serious alcohol problem, it is most likely that\nproblems would occur in the workplace and his finances would be more problematic. As a condition\nto obtain a restricted driver\u2019s license, the court required him to attend an alcohol and substance abuse\nsafety program, which he did. When he completed the program, no further recommendations for\nadditional treatment or to abstain from drinking alcohol were made to him or to the court. It has been\nmore than three years since he received his only DUI. Because of his alcohol education, he has\ndecided he will not drive if he has consumed two beers at home. This decision does not indicate that\n\nMC \u00b6 23(d) does not apply because the record does not contain any evidence from a qualified professional\n28\nor licensed social worker discussing a diagnosis or favorable prognosis.\n8\nhe is impaired after drinking two beers, but reflects sound, rational and mature decision making\nrelated to the use of alcohol and driving.\nThe record contains no evidence that Applicant consumes alcohol to excess and to\nimpairment since receiving his DUI ticket in 2004. He continues to drink in moderation. His overall\nhistory indicates that he has consumed alcohol, primarily beer, in moderation for many years. The\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence does not reflect an understanding of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, his\nlifestyle, work history, or medical history. Because he works with lead on a daily basis, his employer\nrequires him to submit to a regular physical examination for lead poisoning. These examinations\ninclude blood and urine tests. The record contains no evidence which indicates that these tests results\nshowed a problem with alcohol consumption. Because his employer has strict rules concerning the\nconsumption of alcohol at work and arriving at work intoxicated, I infer that these tests over the last\n36 years showed no alcohol problems. Had a problem been demonstrated, Applicant\u2019s employer\nwould have proceeded with disciplinary action against him under its rules and in accordance with\nthe terms of the union contract. I have weighed all the evidence of record and concluded that the\nApplicant has mitigated any concerns about his alcohol consumption under Guideline G, Mitigating\nCondition (MC) \u00a723 (a) and the whole person.28\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline G :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-e: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Based on a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and remand order, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information must be granted.\nOn August 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented\nMay 30, 2008\n\nUpon review of the hearing transcript, it appears that one government exhibit and two Applicant exhibits were\n1\nreceived and marked, but not formally admitted into evidence. Since there were no objections to the admission\nof these exhibits at the hearing, the exhibits are admitted into the record.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated August 23, 2007, at 1-2.\n2\nId.\n3\nGE 1 (Security clearance application) at 1, 4-5; Tr. at 32-34.\n4\n2\nby the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. On August 23, 2007, Applicant submitted a\nnotarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. \nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 19,\n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2007. Due to a personal\nemergency, DOHA reassigned this case to me on October 10, 2007. I held a hearing on\nOctober 17, 2007. The government submitted seven exhibits (GE), which were marked\nand admitted into evidence as GE 1-7. Applicant submitted nine documents, which were\nmarked and admitted into evidence as Applicant exhibits (AE) A-I.  I held the record\n1\nopen until November 16, 2007 for the submission of additional evidence. The hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on October 31, 2007. Applicant submitted three additional\ndocuments, which were marked and admitted into evidence as AE J-L without objection.\nDOHA issued my decision on November 29, 2007. Department Counsel\nappealed it, alleging error in my findings under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e). The Appeal Board\nremand this case for further findings under Guideline G.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation under Guideline G, subparagraph 1.d and\nadmitted in part and denied in part the allegation in subparagraph 1.b of the SOR.2\nThose admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the remaining\nallegations.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n3\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 57 years old. He began working for his current employer, a\nDepartment of Defense contractor, in August 1971. He currently works as a shipfitter\nforeman, in lead caulking and chipping. He does not work with classified documents or\ndrawings. His clearance is needed for access only. He has 36 years of continuous\nservice with his employer. He has held a security clearance since 1984 or 1985, without\nany violations for failure to follow security procedures. He completed his renewal\nsecurity clearance application (SF-86) on March 28, 2006.4\n\nGE 1, supra note 4, at 6-9, 11-12; Tr. at 32, 34.\n5\nAE J (Letter, dated November 11, 2007); Tr. at 58-64.\n6\nGE 3 (Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal records report, dated June 7, 2004);\n7\nGE 4 (Court docket sheet); Tr. at 39-42, 44, 47, 68-69.\nTr. at 38, 42, 44, 67.\n8\n3\nApplicant married in 1969. He graduated high school in 1970. He and his first\nwife divorced in 1984. He married his current wife in 1984. He has three children, a\ndaughter now 37 years old and two sons, ages 33 and 32.5\nSince beginning his employment, Applicant\u2019s employer has required him to get a\nphysical at its health clinic as part of its program for monitoring for lead poisoning. From\n1971 until 1985, these physical examinations occurred every 90 days, and included a\nblood pressure check, a review of fingers and gums (if the gums were turning purple, it\nwas a sign of lead poisoning), a hand strength, and blood and urine testing. After 1985,\nthe physical examinations and testing took place twice a year, and a complete physical\nexamination is conducted once a year. His test results have always been negative for\nany serious problems. In March 2007, his urine test showed blood in his urine, but in\nAugust 2007, his urine test results were normal. The clinic at his work site refused to\nprovide him with a copy of his medical records.6\nApplicant began drinking beer around age 22 or 23. In June 2004, Applicant\nattended a family picnic, where he drank beer from early afternoon until about an hour\nbefore his departure. On his way home, the police arrested and charged him with\ndriving under the influence (DUI) after his breathalyzer results showed a 13% level of\nalcohol. Applicant had never received a ticket for DUI prior to this date. He pled guilty.\nThe court sentenced him as a first time offender, to 30 days in jail, suspended; fined him\n$300, $100 suspended; and restricted his driving privileges for one year, contingent\nupon his participation in an alcohol and substance abuse program.  \n7\nAs directed, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol and substance abuse program. He\nstarted attending the program in October 2004 after his initial one-on-one 45 minute\ninterview with the program director. He completed six months of weekly group\ncounseling in April 2005 and attended 52 sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nbefore he completed the program in September 2005. During his time in this program,\nhe did not drink alcohol. At no time did any counselor advise him not to drink alcohol in\nthe future. The record contains no clinical reports from this program, and in particular,\nno report from this program diagnosing him as alcohol dependent.8\nSince 2005, Applicant has continued to drink beer on the weekends. He usually\nconsumes three to four beers at one time, sometimes when watching a game. He does\nnot drink wine and will occasionally drink a mixed drink when out. In the summer, he\nmay drink one or two beers in the evening. He may not drink anything for a week or\nmore. Since completing the alcohol program, he will not drive if he drinks two beers at\n\nId. at 39, 47-48, 51-52, 69-75; AE A (Attendance record).\n9\nTr. at 48-49.\n10\nGE 5 (Counseling report, dated May 12, 2007).

According to the Director, blood in the urine may be indicative of liver damage.\n12\nAE H (Copy of counselor\u2019s business card); AE I (Information sheet on counseling); Tr. 48.\n13\n4\nhome. He has not experienced any blackouts as a result of his drinking. He does not\ndrink in the morning. His work attendance record for the last seven years indicates that\nhe regularly arrives at work on time and does not miss work on a regular basis because\nof unexcused absences or health reasons. This record supports his statement that he\nhas not missed work because of alcohol usage. He denies an alcohol problem. His\nsupervisor has never sent him to the clinic because of alcohol use.9\nAfter completing his SF-86, he returned to the same alcohol and substance\nabuse program for an evaluation at the request of his security office. He met with the\nsame director in May 2007 for approximately 45 minutes and provided her with a urine\nsample. At the hearing, he admitted that he had not be truthful with her about when he\nlast consumed alcohol. He told he had not consumed alcohol in one month, when it had\nbeen two days.10\nThe Director, who is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Marital\nand Family Therapist (LNFT) and Licensed Substance Abuse Treatment Practioner\n(LSATP), prepared a written report on this interview and the one urine test result. Based\non the positive ethylglucuronide reading,  his statement that there was blood in his\n11\nurine test at work in March 2007,  treatment history (without any further information),\n12\nand his lack of honesty in self-reporting his alcohol use, the Director recommended an\nintensive treatment program of at least six months after a complete medical evaluation\nand liver enzyme testing program. In her May 2007 report, the Director not only\nrecommended a full medical evaluation, she opined that because Applicant self-\nreported blood in his urine on one occasion, he may have liver damage from his alcohol\nuse even though she is not a medical doctor. \nIn a supplemental report prepared in September 2007, the Director stated that\nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis after the May 2007 interview was Alcohol Dependence 303.90\n(with tolerance). The supplemental report reflects that the diagnosis is based on his\nurine test results. Applicant has not followed up with the recommended treatment. He,\nhowever, consulted with a professional counselor about an evaluation. The counselor\nadvised that it would take four or five sessions at least to provide an evaluation. The\nDirector\u2019s May 2007 and September 2007 reports were sent to DOHA representatives,\nbut not to Applicant although he admitted receiving the first letter.13\n\nAE K (Medical report, dated June 13, 2005); AE L (Medical report, dated November 6, 2007); Tr. at 90-91.\n14\nGE 7.\n15\nAE B (Letter, dated October 8, 2007); AE C (2007 Performance Feedback, dated October 1, 2007); AE G\n16\n(Credit report, dated October 3, 2007).\nAE D (Disciplinary guidelines); AE E (Copy of relevant labor agreement provisions).\n17\n5\nIn August 2007, Applicant underwent his six-month lead poisoning physical\nexamination, with normal testing results. In June 2005 and in November 2007, his\nprivate physician examined him, and directed routine blood and urinalysis tests. The\nJune 2005 report does not indicate any abnormal test results.14\nThe government entered into evidence pages 175-181 and 195-196 from the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), which\nreviews the criteria for diagnosing substance-related disorders. The DSM-IV, page 176-\n179, defines substance dependence as a cluster of three or more of the symptoms\nlisted below occurring at any time in the same 12-month period. The symptoms include\ntolerance; withdrawal; drinking beyond the limit set for consuming alcohol; unsuccessful\nefforts at decreasing or discontinuing use of alcohol after persistent expression to do so;\nspending a great deal of time obtaining alcohol, using alcohol or recovering from the\neffects of the alcohol; daily activities resolve around alcohol use; and continued use of\nalcohol after recognizing the contributing role of the substance to a psychological or\nphysical problem. The key issue in evaluating this criterion is not the existence of a\nproblem, but rather the failure to abstain from using alcohol despite having evidence of\nthe difficulties it is causing. The DSM-IV, page 179, states that \u201cwith physiological\ndependence\u201d should be used when substance dependence is accompanied by evidence\nof tolerance and withdrawal. A similar statement is made concerning alcohol\ndependence on page 195.15\nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation by his current supervisor rated\nhim at 4, the highest rating available. His supervisor from late 2004 until early 2007\ndescribes Applicant as a dependable and excellent employee with excellent attendance.\nApplicant\u2019s recent credit report reflects that his bills are paid in a timely manner and his\nfinances are well managed.16\nThe labor agreement between Applicant\u2019s employer and the union representing\nemployees outlines the policy for alcohol use during work hours and the criteria under\nwhich the employer may test for alcohol use. His employer\u2019s disciplinary guidelines\nprovide for immediate discharge if alcohol is used on the job or an employee reports to\nwork under the influence of alcohol, subject to the terms of the union contract which\ndoes allow for one period of rehabilitation before discharge.17\nDepartment counsel mailed interrogatories to Applicant in the spring of 2007,\ndate  unknown. The interrogatories directed Applicant to provide full and truthful\nanswers to the questions.

Applicant responded that he made a mistake driving under the influence\nand that he would not let drinking effect his job. His answer is not responsive to the\nquestion. In response to Question 5, Applicant denied that he was an alcoholic. The\nrecords, which serve as the basis for the background information and diagnosis, are not\npart of the record nor were these records provided to Applicant with the interrogatories.\nApplicant never received the earlier records, although he received the more recent\nreports in discovery.18\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge\nneed not view the revised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are\nintended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense\ndecisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or\nagainst clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each\nsecurity clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.19\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden\n20\n21\nof proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.  Once the\n22\ngovernment has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Additionally,\n23\nan applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.24\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n25\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n26\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial\n27\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to\ndeny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n28\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Appeal Board remanded this case for reconsideration of my findings under\nAG DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and 22(e). The Board concluded that I erred when I found the\ngovernment\u2019s burden of proof insufficient based on the qualifications of the medical\nprofessional and the submitted medical report\u2019s lack of credibility.\nThe Appeal Board held that I interpreted the meaning of the term \u201cmedical\nprofessional\u201d in AG \u00b6 22(d) too narrowly and that the Director of the alcohol and\nsubstance abuse program meets the definition as set forth in the guidelines. Based on\nthe Appeal Board\u2019s determination, I find that the Director is a medical professional. As a\nmedical professional, the Director renders opinions regarding individuals she has\nevaluated and may have also treated. Her opinions may include a diagnosis regarding\n\nAG \u00b6 22(d) requires \u201c[a] diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol\n29\ndependence.\u201d Merriam-W ebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary. Eleventh Edition, defines diagnosis as \u201cthe art or act\nidentifying a disease from its signs and symptoms.\u201d\nBased on my 16 years of experience in disability law, the Director\u2019s letters would be viewed by the federal\n30\ncourts as medical reports because the letters are based on medical records and testing. Her opinion would\nalso be scrutinized under the cited legal standard to determine if the reports would have an adequate\nfoundation to meet the government\u2019s substantial evidence burden of proof.\n8\nan individual\u2019s substance abuse related problems, such as alcohol.  To render such an\n29\nopinion, a medical professional usually prepares a written report outlining the basis for\nthe diagnosis contained in the opinion. In this case, the government submitted two\nreports from the Director, which constitute her opinion regarding Applicant\u2019s use of\nalcohol and affects of his alcohol use. The second report contains, for the first time in\nSeptember 2007, a specific diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\nThe Appeal Board has always held that findings of fact are for the administrative\njudge and that they cannot substitute their opinion for that of the administrative judge, a\nposition supported by well-settled federal case law. In Director, OWCP v. Rowe, 710\nF.2d 251, 254-255 (6  Cir. 1983), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nth\nCircuit held, \u201cThe determination of whether a physician\u2019s report is sufficiently\ndocumented and reasoned is essentially a credibility matter and is for the finder of fact\nto decide.\u201d See also Poole v. Freeman United Coal Mining Company, 897 F.2d 888 (7th\nCir. 1990).\nConcerning my credibility findings on the Director\u2019s opinion, the Appeal Board\nconcluded the Director\u2019s diagnosis was contained in a summarization of an evaluation,\nand thus is not a medical record.  Because the Appeal Board held her reports are not\n30\nmedical records, the Appeal Board concluded:\nThe judge cites to no evidence in the record from which one can\nreasonably conclude that the Director did not utilize accepted standards,\ncriteria, or methodology in making her diagnosis nor is there any evidence\nthat would otherwise impugn her competence. \nRemand Decision at 5.\nIn essence, the Appeal held that before I can find a medical report or summary\nevaluation not credible, the record must contain evidence challenging the methodology\nor contradicting the diagnosis. The Appeal Board\u2019s conclusion is contrary to\nlongstanding legal standards and federal case law because it shifts the burden from the\nproponent of the evidence to the Applicant. This is particularly inappropriate when the\ngovernment is represented by skilled counsel and the Applicant is not represented by\ncounsel.\nIn order to reach a credibility finding on the validity of the Director\u2019s reasoning, I\nam not required by law to rely on other evidence of record regarding methodology and\n\nIn a recent personal appearance case, I relied on a psychological evaluation submitted into the record as\n31\nit complied with Army Regulation 380-67, Chapter 5, Section 5-106 d report writing standards. The medical\nprofessional outlined in his detailed report the following steps taken by him in reaching his conclusion. He\ninterviewed and tested the Appellant on three occasions, talked with Appellant\u2019s criminal attorney on two\noccasions, interviewed Appellant\u2019s mother and physician, and reviewed a written memorandum from\nAppellant\u2019s supervisor. From these interviews, the medical professional developed a family and developmental\nhistory, educational history, employment history, medical history, substance use and abuse history, mental\nhealth history, dating and sexual history, and criminal history which were explained in detail in his report. The\nmedical professional also administered the following tests: Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory -\nSecond Edition (MMPI-2), Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Second Edition (PCL:R2), and Mental Health\nExamination. Based on all this information, the medical professional reached a diagnosis and conclusion\nregarding the Appellant\u2019s medical problems. This is an example of a well-documented medical evaluation. The\nmedical professional rendered a reasoned opinion based on the information he outlined in his report. PA Case\nNo. 07-17085.\n9\nstandards to decide that the Director\u2019s opinion is not reasoned, and therefore, not\ncredible.  A medical report must stand on its own. For the Director\u2019s report and\ndiagnosis to be credible, I must determine if the report is well-reasoned and conclusions\nare adequately documented. In making this credibility determination, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, like other United States Courts of Appeal, said:\nThe mere fact that an opinion is asserted to be based upon medical\nstudies cannot by itself establish as a matter of law that it is documented\nand reasoned. Rather, that determination requires the factfinder to\nexamine the validity of the reasoning of a medical opinion in light of the\nstudies conducted and the objective indications upon which the medical\nopinion or conclusion is based. . .\n \nPhillips v. Director, OWCP, 768 F.2d 982 (8  Cir. 1985) (citing Director, OWCP v.\nth\nRowe, 710 F.2d 251, 254-255 (6  Cir. 1983)).\nth\n31\nUnder its law, this State can pay for substance abuse treatment through its\nmedical program. The state\u2019s governing regulations outline specific criteria regarding\nthe qualifications of individuals rendering treatment and the types of treatment which\ncan be provided.  In addition, state regulations require community substance abuse\ntreatment services to evaluate an individual prior to treatment and render a written\nreport. A minimal evaluation and report consists of a structured objective assessment of\nthe impact of substance use or dependence on the recipient\u2019s functioning in the\nfollowing areas: drug use, alcohol use, legal system involvement, employment and/ or\nschool issues, and medical, family-social, and psychiatric issues. 12 VAC 30-50-228;\nSee also 12 VAC 30-50-141, 12 VAC 30-50-151, 12 VAC 30-50-181.\nThe government submitted portions of the DSM-IV as supporting evidence for the\nDirector\u2019s alcohol dependence diagnosis, since she specifically referenced this manual\nin her report. As previously noted, the DSM-IV, a well-recognized diagnostic tool, makes\nspecific reference to a cluster of three criteria which a professional must consider when\nmaking a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. The Director\u2019s report does not identify three\ncluster criteria which serves as a basis for her ultimate conclusion. It does not reflect\n\n10\nApplicant had a problem with withdrawal; drank beyond the limit set for consumption of\nalcohol; unsuccessful efforts at decreasing or discontinuing use of alcohol after\npersistent expression to do so; spending a great deal of time obtaining alcohol, using\nalcohol or recovering from the effects of the alcohol; daily activities resolve around\nalcohol use; and continued use of alcohol after recognizing the contributing role of the\nsubstance to a psychological or physical problem. Rather, the Director relied on one\nblood-alcohol test, unidentified history, one DUI, previous court-related treatment\nprogram, and his lack of truthfulness about his consumption of alcohol, factors which\nare not discussed in the DSM-IV. She also suggested that he may have serious liver\ndisease, which is a finding for a medical doctor, not her. There are many possible\nreasons for blood in urine that are unrelated to alcohol consumption or liver damage.\nThe DSM-IV directs that the key issue in evaluating the above criterion is not the\nexistence of a problem, but rather the failure to abstain from using alcohol despite\nhaving evidence of the difficulties it is causing. In her report, the Director does not\ndiscuss any difficulties Applicant is having because he has not abstained from alcohol.\nThe record evidence indicates that since receiving his first DUI in June 2004 and\ncompleting his substance abuse treatment program, Applicant has modified his use of\nalcohol. He now drinks beer on the weekend and does not drive. He reports to work\nevery day, using leave at a normal level. Under the terms of the union contract, he\nwould be fired immediately if he drank on the job or showed up to work smelling of\nalcohol. He has been married for 23 years and held his current employment for 36\nyears. He must undergo a physical examination twice a year at his job and his test\nresults have generally been normal. He does not have financial problems. A\nconsideration of these factors could be important in evaluating Applicant under the\nDSM-IV criteria and state law.\nThe Director\u2019s medical report is minimally documented. However, as previously\nstated, I find that this medical report is not reasoned because it does not address the\nDSM-IV criteria necessary to make a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. I again find that\nthe government has established a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c), but\nnot under AG \u00b6 22(d) because the report is not reasoned and does not follow standard\nreport writing criteria. AG \u00b6 22(e) does not apply because the Director is not a licensed\nsocial worker, the specific requirement of this disqualifying condition.\nI disagree with the Appeal Board\u201ds conclusion that the government has\nestablished its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e) because the Director, as a medical\nprofessional, has not rendered a medically sufficient report to support her diagnosis as\nrequired by the DSM-IV. In addition, since Applicant has not been given any\ndocumentary evidence of a diagnosis of alcohol dependency (this diagnosis was not in\nthe May 2007 report), he had not received proper notice of the government\u2019s intent to\nrely on the Director\u2019s September 2007 diagnosis until shortly before the hearing.\nApplicant had no opportunity to develop legally sufficient evidence in mitigation.\nWhile I have a fundamental disagreement with the Appeal Board\u2019s decision to\nundertake de novo review and to substitute its opinion for mine in its factual finding and\n\n11\nconclusion that the government has established the application of disqualifying\nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and 22(e), I will assume both disqualifying conditions apply and\nconsider the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23.\nSince receiving his one and only DUI, Applicant continues to drink in moderation,\nwhich is not illegal. The question under AG \u00b6 23(a) is whether his behavior would\nreoccur or casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\nAlthough he continues to drink, Applicant refrains from driving and drinking, so there is\nlittle likelihood that he will be arrested for DUI. He does not drink at work or prior to\ngoing to work, as he knows he will loose his job immediately. He has a very good work\nattendance record and his employer praises his work skills. He is a team leader and\nskilled at his job. He has no work related discipline or security violations. His current use\nof alcohol does not raise a concern about his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability\neven if the diagnosis of alcohol dependence is correct. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. The\nremaining mitigating conditions are not applicable to this case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn my previous decision, I made a whole person analysis, much of which I again\nuse in this decision. Protection of our national security is of paramount concern.\nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further\npunishment for past transgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is\nthe fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness\nfor access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I have considered\nthe whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting\nour national interests. \nApplicant began drinking beer as a young man and continues to drink beer on a\nregular basis. He denies drinking to excess and impairment, despite the opinion of the\nsubstance abuse Director that he is alcohol dependent. The Director\u2019s report provides\nlittle support for her analysis because she has not articulated an understanding of the\nApplicant as an entire person, as required by the DSM-IV. Outside of her report, the\nrecord lacks evidence that Applicant abuses alcohol. His work attendance is excellent.\nHis most recent work evaluation is at the highest level and his bills are paid in a timely\nmanner. If he had a serious alcohol problem, it is most likely that problems would occur\nin the workplace and his finances would be more problematic. As a condition to obtain a\nrestricted driver\u2019s license, the court required him to attend an alcohol and substance\nabuse safety program, which he did. He denies that when he completed the program,\nany recommendations for additional treatment or abstinence from drinking alcohol were\nmade to him and the record contains no evidence of such a recommendation to him or\nto the court. It has been more than three years since he received his only DUI. Because\nof his alcohol education, he has decided he will not drive if he has consumed two beers\nat home. This decision does not indicate that he is impaired after drinking two beers, but\nreflects sound, rational and mature decision making related to the use of alcohol and\ndriving.\n\n12\nOther than the one blood-alcohol test relied upon by the substance abuse\ndirector, the record contains no evidence that Applicant consumes alcohol to excess\nand to impairment since receiving his DUI ticket in 2004. He acknowledges that he\ncontinues to drink in moderation. His overall history indicates that he has consumed\nalcohol, primarily beer, in moderation for many years. The diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence does not reflect an understanding of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, his lifestyle,\nwork history, or medical history and thus, is given little credence. Because he works\nwith lead on a daily basis, his employer requires him to submit to a regular physical\nexamination for lead poisoning. These examinations include blood and urine tests. The\nrecord contains no evidence which indicates that these tests results showed a problem\nwith alcohol consumption, which could raise workplace issues for him. Because his\nemployer has strict rules concerning the consumption of alcohol at work and arriving at\nwork intoxicated, I infer that these tests over the last 36 years showed no serious\nalcohol problems. Had a problem been demonstrated, Applicant\u2019s employer would have\nproceeded with disciplinary action against him under its rules and in accordance with\nthe terms of the union contract. Based entirely on the \u201cwhole person analysis\u201d without\nconsidering the applicability of any mitigating conditions, including AG \u00b6 23(a), alcohol\nconsumption is mitigated under Guideline G and the whole person.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline G :\nFOR APPLICANT\n   Subparagraph 1.a: \n   For Applicant\n   Subparagraph 1.b: \n   For Applicant\n   Subparagraph 1.c: \n   For Applicant\n   Subparagraph 1.d: \n   For Applicant\n   Subparagraph 1.e: \n   For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n                                                             \nMary E.

He denied the remaining allegations. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due 3 consideration, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old. He began working for his current employer, a Department of Defense contractor, in August 1971. He currently works as a shipfitter foreman, in lead caulking and chipping. He does not work with classified documents or drawings. His clearance is needed for access only. He has 36 years of continuous service with his employer. He has held a security clearance since 1984 or 1985, without any violations for failure to follow security procedures.

He has three children, a daughter now 37 years old and two sons, ages 33 and 32.5 Since beginning his employment, Applicant\u2019s employer has required him to get a physical at its health clinic as part of its program for monitoring for lead poisoning. From 1971 until 1985, these physical examinations occurred every 90 days, and included a blood pressure check, a review of fingers and gums (if the gums were turning purple, it was a sign of lead poisoning), a hand strength, and blood and urine testing. After 1985, the physical examinations and testing took place twice a year, and a complete physical examination is conducted once a year. His test results have always been negative for any serious problems. In March 2007, his urine test showed blood in his urine, but in August 2007, his urine test results were normal. The clinic at his work site refused to provide him with a copy of his medical records.6 Applicant began drinking beer around age 22 or 23. In June 2004, Applicant attended a family picnic, where he drank beer from early afternoon until about an hour before his departure. On his way home, the police arrested and charged him with driving under the influence (DUI) after his breathalyzer results showed a 13% level of alcohol. Applicant had never received a ticket for DUI prior to this date. He pled guilty. The court sentenced him as a first time offender, to 30 days in jail, suspended; fined him $300, $100 suspended; and restricted his driving privileges for one year, contingent upon his participation in an alcohol and substance abuse program. 7 As directed, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol and substance ",

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 44 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense contractor as\nan engineer.  He has family in Jordan and the West Bank area of Israel.  He uses an Israeli\nidentification card when visiting his family, which he does regularly every two or three years.  His\nfamily have Jordanian passports.  His wife is a Jordanian citizen with a passport, and is a permanent\nU.S. resident.  Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence and foreign preference security\nconcerns.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On April 9, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing\non April 30, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was\nassigned to me on July 5, 2007.  \nOn July 26, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government submitted\nexhibits that were admitted into evidence.  The Applicant did not submit any exhibits.\nDuring the course of the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to conform it\nto the evidence on the record.  Four amendments were proposed.  The first amendment was to\nSubparagraph 1.d, to add the date \u201cand 2007.\u201d  Next, a new Subparagraph 1.e was proposed, to read,\n\u201cYour wife is a citizen of Jordan with a Jordanian passport and an Israeli identification card, and is\na permanent resident of the U.S.\u201d  A new Subparagraph 1.f was proposed to read, \u201cYou inherited\none-seventh of a home, worth approximately $140,000, which is located in Jerusalem, Israel.\u201d  Then,\na new Paragraph 2 under Guideline C, with Subparagraph 2.a reading \u201cYou maintain an Israeli\nidentification card at the border of Israel and Jordan.  You used this identification card when you\nentered Israel in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2007.\u201d  Applicant had no objection to any of these\namendments, and I granted the motions to amend the SOR.  Applicant then entered answers to each\namendatory subparagraph by admitting each of the allegations. (Tr. 85-92)  DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on August 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to all the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 44 years old, married to his second wife for the past five year, and has two\nchildren from this marriage.  Applicant works for a defense contractor as an engineer.  He owns his\nown home in the U.S., valued at about $300,000. (Tr. 14-19, 64, 66; Exhibit 1) \nApplicant is of Palestinian heritage.  He immigrated to the United States from Jerusalem,\nIsrael, on a Jordanian passport in 1982 to obtain a college degree.  The Jordanian government issues\npassports to Palestinian residents of the West Bank territory, including Jerusalem, to allow them to\ntravel.  Applicant traveled on such a passport to get an education in the United States.  He\naccomplished that goal in 1988, and returned to Jerusalem to care for his sick father who died in\n1989.  Then, he returned to the United States in 1990 to obtain his master\u2019s degree.  He never got\n\n3\nthat degree.  He married his first wife on December 12, 1990, and was divorced on January 8, 2001.\nHis first wife is a U.S. citizen.  His present wife has a Jordanian passport, an Israeli identification\ncard, and grew up in Jerusalem.  She has permanent residency status in the U.S.  Their two children\nwere born in the U.S.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen on February 14, 1995.  He has a U.S.\npassport.  He cannot find his expired Jordanian passport. (Tr. 14-16, 32, 44, 48, 66, 77, 79;\nExhibits1-3)\nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and three brothers live in Jerusalem, which is part of Israel.  With\nhis brothers and mother, he inherited in 1989 one-seventh of a house in Jerusalem, Israel, in which\nhis mother, aged 86 years, and two brothers currently live.  The house is valued at about $140,000.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother in Jerusalem is a teacher, aged 60, and about to retire.  His other brother\nis a building contractor with his own business.  His youngest brother is an electrician.  His sister is\na housewife.  None of them have worked for the government or served in an military organization.\nHis mother gets a pension from the Israeli government, similar to the U.S. social security system,\nso Applicant does not send her money.  Applicant also has two older brothers who are resident\ncitizens of Jordan.  They are retired from business.  The oldest brother is in his 70s.  The other\nbrother is 68.  They worked in Saudi Arabia, but retired to Jordan because Saudi Arabia would not\nallow them to become citizens.  Applicant telephones his mother two or three times a month to speak\nwith her.  He speaks to his siblings if they are at home with his mother when he calls.  He sees his\ntwo brothers in Jordan when he flies there for his triennial family visits and  vacations.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s parents, sister, and three brothers live in Jerusalem.  The youngest is a student, the other two\nwork in private businesses. (Tr. 18, 21-29, 41, 52, 58; Exhibits 1-3)\nApplicant traveled to Jerusalem to visit his mother in 2000, 2002, 2004, and March 2007.\nHe also traveled there about every three years in the 1990s.  When his mother dies, he doubts he will\nreturn to visit his siblings.  When he travels to Jerusalem, he flies into Amman, Jordan, visits his two\nbrothers, and then drives to Jerusalem.  At the Israeli and Jordanian border, he obtains an Israeli\nidentification card, as does his wife.  They use that card while in Israel.  He could use his U.S.\npassport to go to Jerusalem.  If stopped by any police or security officials, he would show them the\nU.S. passport and the Israeli identification card.  Applicant claims that the Israeli identification card\nwill \u201cnot hurt at all\u201d, so he continues to use it whenever he visits his mother.  They surrender it when\nthey depart Israel and returns to the United States.  During his visits, Applicant does not leave Israel,\nsite-sees only in that area, and does not travel to the West Bank. (Tr. 30, 33-39, 52-58, 68; Exhibits\n1-3)\nI take administrative notice of the governments and political conditions at the present time\nin Jordan and Israel.  Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and a developing economy.  It has a pro-\nWestern foreign policy.  It has some human rights problems, including torture, arbitrary arrest and\nprolonged detention, overcrowded prisons, denial of due process.  The threat of terrorism remains\nhigh in Jordan despite its efforts to pursue terrorists, prosecute them and disrupt terrorist plots.  In\nNovember 2005, three hotels in Amman, Jordan, were bombed, after an August 2005, rocket attack\nand the 2002 assassination of a U.S. diplomat.  Jordan issues West Bank residents five-year\npassports which do not connote citizenship.  The Jordanian government grants these passports to\npost-1967 West Bank residents who are not citizens of Jordan, and are not allowed to become\ncitizens.  In 1988 the Jordanian government renounced all claims to the West Bank, but retained an\nadministrative role. This action occurred after the 1967 War in which Israel seized the West Bank\narea from Jordan. (Exhibit 4, including the March 2007, State Department Report on human rights\n\n4\npractices in Jordan at pages 10 and 16 of 18, and the 2005 Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage Report)\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy with an elected government.  It has a diversified and\ntechnologically advanced economy.  The United States is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Israel\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, but there are some issues dealing with Palestinian detainees.\nU.S. citizens are urged by the State Department to exercise great caution in public places because\nof suicide bombings by terrorists fighting Israel and the U.S. support for Israel.  Israel has close\nmilitary ties with the United States.  However, there are several issues of concern.  Israeli military\nsales to the Peoples Republic of China, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual property\nrights, and several espionage cases perpetrated against the United States by Israeli operatives.  The\n1985 Pollard case and the 2005 Franklin case are two espionage cases of particular note and concern.\nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens the U.S. national security in military and\neconomic terms.  The National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress lists Israel as\none of the active collectors of proprietary information. (Exhibit 4, including the March 2007, State\nDepartment Report on human rights practices in Jordan at pages 10 and 16 of 18, and the 2005\nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage Report)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because\n\n5\neach security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that\nthe factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.\nMoreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an\nunfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a\nrecent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified\nin the Guidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. \u00b66\nGuideline C:  The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \u00b69\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nForeign Influence:  Applicant\u2019s mother and six siblings reside in Jerusalem and Jordan.\nThey are citizens of Jordan, or hold Jordanian passports without citizenship because they reside on\nthe West Bank area and are Palestinians.  Applicant visits his family routinely, about every two or\nthree years.  He returned most recently from a visit in March 2007.  He owns one-seventh of a house\nin which his mother and some siblings currently reside in Jerusalem, and his interest he estimates\nat $20,000.  He flies into Amman, Jordan, whenever he visits his family.  He telephones his mother\ntwo or three times per month.  His wife has a Jordanian passport and is a citizen of Jordan.  Her\nfamily members live in Jerusalem.  She is a permanent resident of the U.S.  Applicant became a U.S.\ncitizen in 1995.\nThe four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under those\nfacts and which are applicable here are: \u00b67.a (contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen\nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); \u00b67.b (connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information); \u00b67.d (sharing living quarters with a person,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion); and \u00b67.e (a substantial business, financial, or property interest\nin a foreign country which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation).  \nTwo mitigating conditions may apply: \u00b68.a (the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons\nin that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of the foreign individual and the interests of the U.S.); and \u00b68.b (there\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterests).  Some of Applicant\u2019s family members are older than 60 years and retired.  His wife\u2019s\nsiblings are younger and working.  Neither Applicant nor his wife send money to their parents.\nTheir relationships are strictly familial, not business.  But their families live in an area of the Middle\nEast filled with terrorism and unrest, particularly directed against U.S. citizens.  While Applicant\ncontends he will not visit Jerusalem after his mother dies, his wife will continue to have her parents\nand siblings there.  Therefore, \u00b68.a cannot be applied.  Applicant has been in the U.S. since 1982,\nand owns his house.  He has been a citizen since 1995, but makes frequent trips to Jerusalem, every\ntwo or three years, exhibiting a continuing strong attachment to his family and birthplace.\nTherefore,  \u00b68.b cannot apply.\nForeign Preference:  Applicant had a Jordanian passport.  He claims it expired, and cannot\nlocate it among his possessions.  Therefore, its exact status and location are unknown.  Applicant\nuses an Israeli identification card when he travels in the West Bank area to Jerusalem and within\nIsrael for his family visits and vacations every two or three years.  He finds that card more\nconvenient to use than his U.S. passport.  The card is held by the Israeli authorities during the\ninterim  period between Applicant\u2019s visits.\nThe condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying here is \u00b610.a.3\n(exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\n\n7\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to accepting\nbenefits from a foreign country, such as the Israeli identification card).  Applicant clearly stated at\nthe hearing he saw no harm in continuing to use the Israeli identification card for his travel within\nIsrael.  By doing so, he expresses a preference for that country\u2019s documents over his U.S. passport,\nand is disguising his U.S. citizenship for his own benefit.  I considered the Mitigating Conditions\nunder this Guideline C, and concluded none apply.  I conclude the disqualifying conditions are not\nmitigated.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nOf those factors, I conclude Applicant\u2019s knowledgeable participation in traveling to Jordan\nand Jerusalem every two or three years to visit his family members who are citizens of those\ncountries, and use of an Israeli identification card in preference to his U.S. passport, are two\nsignificant factors against Applicant.  Applicant is old enough and educated to such a level that he\nknows if he has access to classified information he could be subject to coercion and other pressures\nby the Israeli government, a known collector of proprietary information.  Applicant and his family\nare also in a delicate situation of being Palestinians living in the West Bank area under Israeli\noccupation, not being citizens of Israel or Jordan, thereby being subject to pressures from both\ngovernments and any Palestinian authorities or terrorists.  Applicant intends to continue his travels\nto the area, visiting his family and taking vacations there, into the foreseeable future.  Under the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept Applicant has not shown that his conduct in the past or into the future would\nbe responsible for someone with access to classified information.\nApplicant has the burden of proof that the mitigating conditions under each guideline should\nbe applied to his benefit over the disqualifying conditions.  He has not met that burden.  Therefore,\nI conclude the foreign influence security concern against Applicant.  I conclude the foreign\npreference security concern amended into the SOR at the hearing against Applicant.  Lastly, the\n\u201cwhole person concept\u201d I conclude against Applicant because of his close family connections in\nJordan and the West Bank, and his frequent and regular trips to those areas.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nPhilip S.

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 15, 2008\n______________\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on September 6,\n2006. On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, but unsigned and undated,\nand then with his signature on November 28, 2007.  He requested that his case be\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn December 19, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on February 6, 2008.\nApplicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 27, 2008.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Items 1-\n9). No documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F- Financial Considerations)\nIn his RSOR (Items 3 and 5) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under\nGuideline F and Guideline E. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 46 years old. He works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 6 allegations (1.a. through 1.f.) regarding financial difficulties under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. As reviewed above, Applicant admitted all of these allegations\nin his RSOR, and no evidence was introduced to modify or dispute these allegations\nand admissions. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant failed to file Federal Income Tax returns for at least every tax year\nfrom 1995 through 2005. As of the time of Applicant\u2019s RSOR on November 28, 2007,\nApplicant had still not filed any of these tax returns. In a Personal Subject Interview,\nwhich was attached and ratified by Applicant in his response to interrogatories (Item 7),\nApplicant stated that he may not have filed Federal Income Tax returns for closer to 15\nyears, nor was he aware if he owed any Federal tax.  \n1.b. Applicant failed to file State Income Tax returns for at least every tax year\nfrom 1995 through 2005. As of Applicant\u2019s RSOR on November 28, 2007, Applicant had\nstill not filed any of these State tax returns. In Item 7, Applicant also stated that he may\nnot have filed State Income Tax returns for closer to 15 years. \nNo information was offered into evidence as to why Applicant failed to file his\nFederal Tax return for all of these years. In his SCA, Applicant indicated that he has\nbeen employed by a defense contractor from May 1984 until the present.\n\n3\nAdditionally, Applicant refused to sign releases that would have permitted a\nreview of his Federal or State Taxes, or records relating to any other debts (Item 7).\n1.c. Applicant is indebted to the State for delinquent taxes in the amount of\n$8,951. A lien was filed in June 1995. As of at least November 28, 2007, this debt has\nnot been paid. \n1.d. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,043 for a\njudgement entered against him in January 2005. As of at least November 28, 2007, this\ndebt has not been paid. \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,318. As of at least\nNovember 28, 2007, this debt has not been paid. \n1.f. This second overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,007.  As of\nat least November 28, 2007, this debt has not been paid. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on September 6, 2006 (Exhibit 6).\nQuestion 28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.\n2.a. Question 28.b. of the SCA asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.\nThere is no dispute that these debts were all long overdue and were still owing at\nthe time Applicant completed the SCA, and they should have been included in the\nresponses to 28. a. and b.  In the PSI, Applicant claims that his omission of material\nfacts on the SCA was not intentional. However, he could give no explanation  for his\nfailure to list any of the debts that he had owed for a significant period of time. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy\nhis debts, and his long history of not meeting financial obligations. DC (g) also is\napplicable for Applicant\u2019s failure to file annual Federal and State tax returns for many\nyears as required by law. \n\n5\nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve any of his overdue debts, or even file the long overdue Federal and State tax\nreturns.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that he executed on March\n13, 2006. Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the last\nseven years prior to his completing the SCA, nor any current debts that were over 90\ndays overdue, when clearly he should have identified the debts listed on the SOR.\nApplicant had no explanation for his failure to put the Government on notice that he had\nfinancial difficulties.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history, my\ninability to see the Applicant and judge his veracity in person, and the lack of any\nwitness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no reasonable\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information to the\nGovernment on the SCA, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly\nfailed to give complete, honest information to the Government. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that \nDC15. (a), failure to complete security forms or releases, applies to Applicant. This\nfailure by Applicant results in an unfavorable clearance action.   \nDC16. (a) also applies because Applicant deliberately provided false and\nmisleading information to the Government in a SCA.   No Mitigating Condition applies\nunder this Guideline.  As a result of the misinformation that Applicant  provided to the\nGovernment, his conduct exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of\ncandor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's evidence opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's SOR. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\n6\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, his failure to file Federal and State\ntax returns for many years, and his willful omissions made to the Government, I find that\nthe record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 18, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 29,\n2005 (Government Exhibit 1). On May 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C and B stating why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 11, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 16, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 6, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on August 13, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 6, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 26, 2007.\nThe government offered Government Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through DD, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on October 9, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 10, 2007, to submit additional matters.  On October 10 and October 11, 2007,\nhe submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits EE and FF, without objection. The record closed on\nOctober 11, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding subparagraph 2.e.,\n\u201cYour daughter, a citizen of Israel and the United States, is currently attending a\nuniversity in Israel.\u201d  The Applicant did not object to the amendment, and stated he did\nnot need additional time to respond to the amendment.  The motion to amend was\ngranted, and the Applicant admitted the additional subparagraph.  (Transcript at 115-\n116.)\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to The State of Israel. (Transcript at 8-12.) The request and the\nattached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as\nAdministrative Judge Exhibit I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48, married, and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer\nScience.  He is the Chief Executive Officer of a defense related company and seeks a\nSecret level clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.

They were married in 1980, and have three children.  Two children were\nborn in Israel and the third in the United Kingdom.  All three children are dual citizens of\nthe United States and Israel (Government Exhibit 1, Section 15.)  They have about $3\nmillion in assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 100.)\nIn accordance with Israeli law, the Applicant served three years in the Israeli Air\nForce as an enlisted man.  This fact has no current security significance.  (Transcript at\n51-53.) \nThe Applicant has an Israeli passport.  In October 2005, the Applicant renewed\nthis passport (Government Exhibit 2 at 10-26.)  He submits that he uses the passport to\ntravel to Israel primarily to visit his aging parents.  On August 30, 2007, the Applicant\nsubmitted his Israeli passport to the Israeli Consulate General.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit CC.)\nThe Israeli Consulate General confirmed on October 1, 2007, that the Applicant\u2019s\npassport had been deposited with them.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit EE at 4.)  Finally, the\nConsulate General also confirmed that the Applicant has requested permission from the\nIsraeli government to travel to Israel using only his American passport.  This letter was\ndated October 10, 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit FF.)\nThe Applicant is still a dual citizen of Israel and the United States.  The totality of\nthe record shows that the Applicant is very reluctant to take the steps to renounce his\nIsraeli citizenship.  The Applicant\u2019s primary reasons for not renouncing his Israeli\ncitizenship appears to be the cost and time involved in applying for revocation, and the\nfact that actual renunciation does not appear to be mandated for the granting of a\nsecurity clearance.  (Transcript at 55-57, 61-68, 102-111.)  At the end of the hearing,\nthe Applicant stated that, as a business decision, he was prepared to start taking steps\nto renounce his Israeli citizenship, stating \u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m willing to do it.\u201d  (Transcript at\n111.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s Israeli passport also shows a trip to Israel from October 23 to October 28, 2006.\n1\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n2\nsupport of her request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Judge Exhibit I and attachments.)\n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens of Israel and reside there.  They are both\nretired and are able to live on their Israeli government pensions.  The Applicant, his wife\nand children have a close relationship with his parents, as well as his wife\u2019s mother.\n(Transcript at 71-76, 80-82.)  The Applicant has one brother.  He is also a citizen of\nIsrael and lives there.  He and the Applicant communicate about twice a year.\n(Transcript at 77-80.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s eldest child is attending a university in Israel as of the date the\nrecord closed.  She has been in Israel since 2005-2006 and is due to return to the\nUnited States in September-October 2008. (Transcript at 93-96.)\nThe Applicant owns an apartment in Israel, which he rents out for between $600\nand $700 a month.  He has owned this apartment since 1990.  The apartment is\nmanaged by a company in Israel.  As of the present time, the Applicant does not plan to\nsell the apartment because he would lose money on the transaction.  (Transcript at 87-\n91.) \nThe Applicant has traveled to Israel in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2007.  During\neach of those trips, he presented his Israeli passport to Israeli authorities.  (Government\nExhibit 2 at 10-26, Transcript at 82.)   For travel other than to Israel, the Applicant uses\n1\nhis American passport.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 28-40; and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit DD.)\nHis last trip to Israel was in connection with making a lecture to a business group in\nIsrael.  (Transcript at 82-87.)\nThe Applicant has many contacts with Israel.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the situation in Israel at this time.   Israel is a parliamentary democracy.  Israel\u2019s\n2\nprime minister leads the executive branch of the government.  The United States is\nIsrael\u2019s leading trading partner.  Israel respects the rights of its citizens; however, there\nare some concerns about Israel\u2019s detention and interrogation of alleged terrorists, and\ndiscrimination against Arabs.  Terrorism is a continuing threat to Israel, and American\ninterests in Israel.  Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close\nfriendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security\ninterests.  Occasionally, Israeli and American interests have diverged.  Several U.S.\ngovernment employees have been prosecuted for disclosure of classified information to\npersons connected to the Israeli government.  Israel has an active program to gather\nproprietary information from U.S. companies.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters and other documents.  They show that the\nApplicant is respected in his industry, and that his company has provided valuable\n\n5\nservices to the defense efforts of the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, E, F,\nG, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, AA.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n6\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, and that he\nhad a valid Israeli passport (Guideline C); and that the Applicant has family members\noverseas (Guideline B)\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully mitigated the\nGovernment's case, except in part.  Subparagraph 1.d. is found for the Applicant as his\nservice in the Israeli Air Force occurred in the distant past and has no current security\nsignificance.  Subparagraph 2.c. is found for the Applicant as the value of his Israeli\napartment is insignificant when viewed against the totality of his assets in the United\nStates.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about his dual citizenship with Israel, and his continued possession and use of\nhis Israeli passport after becoming an American citizen.  The concern is stated thus\nunder this Guideline, When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nUnder any analysis of the evidence, it is obvious that the Applicant would like to\nretain his Israeli citizenship and passport if at all possible.  The Applicant only\ngrudgingly gave his passport to the Israeli authorities on the eve of his case, and while\nhe states that he now intends to begin the process of renouncing his Israeli citizenship,\nas of the time the record closed there was no evidence that he had made any positive\nsteps to do so.\n\n7\nDisqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case: Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.  (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Israeli Consulate General currently holds the Applicant\u2019s passport.  It\nremains a valid passport, available to the Applicant on demand as an Israeli citizen, and\nhas not \u201cbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\u201d  Accordingly, Mitigating Condition 11(e) does not apply to this case.\nAt the end of the hearing, the Applicant stated that he was willing to renounce his\nIsraeli citizenship.  If I believed the statement was credible, Mitigating Condition 11(b)\nwould apply to this case: the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship.  In this case, however, I cannot find that his statement, standing alone, is\nsufficient.  Guideline C is found against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has many and varied connections to Israel on both sides of his\nfamily.  As described above, one of the Applicant\u2019s children is currently attending school\nin Israel.  His parents and his mother in law live in Israel and his family has a close\nrelationship with them. \nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the Israeli\ngovernment, and in particular that government\u2019s history of attempting to obtain classified\nand other information from American companies.  To his credit, the Applicant repeatedly\nstated that he is a loyal American citizen, that he understands his responsibilities as a\nsecurity clearance holder, and that he would not be a party to any attempt by the Israeli\ngovernment to obtain information from him.  However, given the depth and extent of his\ncurrent connections with Israel, he has failed to meet his burden of showing an\nunequivocal connection to the United States. \n\n8\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  I have also considered the information concerning the Israeli government,\nprovided by Department Counsel in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I and its\nattachments. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.  Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Two of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nThe Applicant simply has not engaged in sufficient conduct which shows a preference\n\n9\nfor the United States instead of Israel.  Such conduct might include his taking the\nactions concerning his Israeli passport set forth in Mitigating Condition 11(e).  In\naddition, he could actively engage in renouncing his Israeli citizenship, not merely give\nthat fact lip service.  \nThe lack of any of the actions stated above make it impossible for me to find that\nthere is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth\nin AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nShe answered the SOR in writing on October 8, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel issued\na File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 5, 2007.  The Applicant responded to\nthe FORM (Response) on December 11, 2007.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 8, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in Paragraphs 1.a.~1.d of the SOR, with explanations.  She denied the\nfactual allegations in Paragraph 1.e of the SOR.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nIn January of 1999, the Applicant divorced her former spouse, and \u201cbecame a\nsingle mother . . . working as a Sales Secretary making $12 an hour\u201d (Item 3 at page 1).\nThis was the genesis of the Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.  She is now remarried, and\nhas submitted a plan of action vis-a-vis her admitted past due debts (Response).\n1.a.  Is a debt to creditor #1 in the amount of about $7,349 (Item 7 at page 1).\nThe Applicant acknowledges the past due balance, and avers the following: \u201cHalf to be\npaid on 24 April - balance to be paid July 2008\" (Response at page 2).  She offers no\nevidence that creditor #1 has agreed to this payment methodology.\n1.b.  Is a debt to creditor #2 in the amount of about $517 (Item 7 at page 2).

She again\noffers no evidence that creditor #4 has agreed to this payment methodology.\n1.e.  Is a debt to creditor #5 in the amount of about $222 (Item 7 at page 1).  The\nApplicant acknowledges the past due balance, and avers the following: \u201cwill be paid in\nfull February 2, 2008\" (Response at page 2).  She offers no other evidence.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations@ may raise security concerns.  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may\nbe mitigating, in part, where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. . . . divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.@ However, as noted above, although the\nApplicant has a plan of action to address her past due debts; it is only a plan, without\nmore I can find no \u201cgood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts@ as required by AG Subparagraph 20(d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG Subparagraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHere, the Applicant was placed in a bad financial situation because of her\ndivorce; but she only has a plan of action, with no evidence of any payments or\nacceptance of any payment plans by her creditors.  For this reason, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her Financial\nConsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. He is serving probation until\nsometime in 2008 as a habitual-traffic offender for driving with a suspended driver\u2019s license. It is\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\ntoo soon to tell if he will resolve the financial problems and complete probation in a satisfactory\nmanner. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April\n26, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis\nfor the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations based on\ndelinquent debts, Guideline J for criminal conduct based on his guilty plea to a habitual-traffic\noffender offense, and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a security-clearance\napplication. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn May 25, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 9, 2007, and the transcript was received on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges nine delinquent debts for about $17,300 in total.\nApplicant admitted six and denied three of the debts. He admitted the habitual-traffic offender\noffense alleged under Guideline J. He denied the two falsification allegations concerning financial\ndelinquencies under Guideline E. In addition to his admissions, the following facts are established.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old aviation electronics technician working for a company that\nprovides services to the federal government. He has worked for his current employer since June\n\n3\n2000. He has held a security clearance for many years as a sailor and a civilian employee. He is\nseeking to retain a security clearance for his current employment. \nFrom 1991 to 2000, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy as an aviation\nelectronics technician. He left active duty in June 2000 as a petty officer second class (paygrade E-5),\nand he received an honorable discharge. He did not have financial problems when he was in the\nNavy. Likewise, he held a security clearance in the Navy without incident.  \nApplicant has never married. He has two children with the same woman. His children were\nborn in 2001 and 2003, after his discharge from the Navy. Both children live with their mother.\nApplicant is currently paying court-ordered child support for both children at the rate of about $1,500\nmonthly. He intends to try having that amount reduced, but he has yet to begin the legal process. \nHe has a history of unresolved financial problems that he attributes to an increase in expenses\nafter leaving the Navy and having two children. To reduce expenses, he has lived with an aunt since\n2001. He pays his aunt $300 to $400 monthly for rent. He has about $6,000 in a 401(k) retirement\naccount, which he has taken a loan against in the past. He does not have a savings account, but has\na checking account. He estimated a balance of less than $1,000 in his checking account. He has no\nother financial assets besides personal property. His gross income for 2006 was about $48,000. \nHis derogatory financial history is established by credit reports (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4). For\nexample, a credit report from October 2005 reflects 11 accounts in the trade section of the report of\nwhich 7 accounts were described as past due or as a bad debt placed for collection (Exhibit 4). The\ncollections section of the report lists four accounts. \nApplicant has made some effort to resolve the nine debts in the SOR. The status of his\nindebtedness is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013collection account for $586 based\non Direct TV account.\nUnpaid.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013collection account for $203 based\non telephone account.\nUnpaid. Received lump-sum offer to settle for\n$133.59 in Mar. 2006 (Exhibit A). Intends to\nresolve in future (R. 37\u201340). \nTo sum up, Applicant disputes three debts for $5,262 in total and the remaining six unpaid debts\namount to $12,062 in total. \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since leaving the Navy in 2000. He has not had\nany financial or credit counseling. \nIn March 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged as a habitual-traffic offender  for driving\n3\nwith a suspended license. Previously, the state had suspended his driver\u2019s license when his auto\ninsurance lapsed or went unpaid after the auto repossession in 2004. Applicant pleaded guilty to\nreceive deferred adjudication. The court imposed a fine, three years of probation, and 100 hours of\ncommunity service. He is paying the fine via monthly payments. He is serving probation until\nsometime in 2008. His driver\u2019s license remains suspended.  \nA few months later in June 2005, Applicant completed a security-clearance application\n(Exhibit 1). In doing so, he certified that his answers were true, complete, and correct to the best of\nhis knowledge and belief and made in good faith. Also, he understood that a knowing and willful\nfalse statement on the application could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. He disclosed\nhis criminal conduct (the habitual-traffic offender offense) in response to Question 26. He also\nindicated that sentencing was to take place at the end of July. In response to Questions 38 and 39\nabout his financial record, he answered in the negative. He did not disclose any financial\ndelinquencies called for by the questions. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n4\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n6\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n5\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n8\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n9\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n10\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n11\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n12\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n14\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n15\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n16\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n MC 5 is \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\n19\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\ntaken to resolve the issue.\u201d \n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n20\n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n21\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and DC 4 is \u201cindividual is currently on parole\n22\nor probation.\u201d \n6\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n17\n18\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant receives some credit in mitigation. The most pertinent mitigating condition is the\nfifth MC  of Guideline F. It applies in part because Applicant disputes that three of the debts are his\n19\nresponsibility (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f). He began disputing these three accounts in April 2007, the\nresults of which are pending (Exhibit B). The MC applies in part because it only concerns three of\nthe nine debts. The other MCs under the guideline have been considered and none apply. In\nparticular, he has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his indebtedness because he has taken little\nor no action on the six debts he does not dispute (see table). What is missing here is a realistic,\ncomprehensive plan that addresses Applicant\u2019s indebtedness. \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the security concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n20\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d21\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of traffic-related\ncriminal conduct. Currently, he is serving probation via a deferred adjudication for a habitual-traffic\noffender offense. These circumstances raise two disqualifying conditions  under the guideline.\n22\nAlthough there is not a per se rule, his status as a probationer until sometime in 2008 is a\ncircumstance that militates against a favorable decision.\nAll of the MCs under the guideline have been considered and none apply. His probationary\nstatus undercuts a claim of successful rehabilitation. Completing probation, without violation, will\nbe a positive step toward rehabilitation. And until he obtains a driver\u2019s license and starts driving\nagain, it is simply too soon to tell if this conduct will recur. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n23\n Revised Guidelines at 10. \n24\n7\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  addresses \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment,\n23\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  In this regard,\n24\nthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or\noral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters\nis a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An omission of relevant\nand material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently\noverlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be\nreported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to two questions seeking information\nabout financial delinquencies. He should have revealed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g.\nHe contends he did not intend to mislead the government (R. 61\u201363). His explanation is accepted\nas credible, because the evidence is not sufficient to prove that he made deliberately false answers\nin response to Questions 38 and 39. Indeed, disclosing his criminal conduct is persuasive evidence\nthat he was being honest and truthful when completing the security-clearance application.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \n  \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe combined effect of the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns. He has\na history of unresolved financial problems and he is serving probation until sometime in 2008. Taken\ntogether, it is too soon to tell if he will resolve the financial problems and complete probation in a\nsatisfactory manner. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due\nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, e, f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs b, c, d, g, h, & i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 3\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

On October 18, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on October 30, 2007. At the scheduled hearing on November 16, 2007, the\nGovernment introduced eleven exhibits (GX 1-11) into evidence without objections. Applicant\ntestified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A into evidence without objection from\nDepartment Counsel.  I left the record open until December 2, 2007, for Applicant to submit\nadditional information. She submitted such documentation, which is marked as AX B and entered\ninto the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.a through 1. j in her SOR response under\nGuideline F. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She left high school and married\nat age 18. Her husband died in 1983 and she was left a widow. Her husband was the sole support of\nthe family. As a result, when he died, she had a son to support. On March 31, 1999, she completed\nher security clearance (SF 86) application.  Applicant has  held a secret level security clearance for\n2\nten years.  She has worked for her current employer since 2002.\n3\n4\nApplicant worked at minimum wage jobs and began taking college courses in 1988 to\nimprove her work skills. She could not support herself and her son on her earnings. She had no\nchoice but to file for bankruptcy in 1989. She filed Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 so that she could\npay her creditors. She satisfied the debts in the mid 1990's.5\n\nTr. 22.\n6\nTr. 24.\n7\nTr. 56.\n8\nTr. 25.\n9\nId.; Tr. 45.\n10\nTr. 54.\n11\n3\nIn 1993, Applicant remarried. She accepted the financial responsibility in the marriage for\n14 years. Her husband did not work nor accept responsibility for the household debts. In fact, he\nsquandered the household money.  In 1994, Applicant\u2019s daughter was born with a congenital birth\ndefect which required extensive medical care, including several surgeries. Some of the medical bills\ninvolved hospitalizations of two months or longer. Applicant paid what she could but the health\ninsurance did not cover the remainder of the various bills to specialists and other providers.6\nIn 1996, Applicant started to work on line for various companies located in different states.\nShe worked but did not receive W-2s or 1099s from the companies.  She tried to contact the\n7\ncompanies but they did not respond. She filed her taxes despite not having the correct forms. The\nIRS contacted her about the back taxes. She elected a lien on her house. She has now started to pay\nthe back taxes after an arrangement with the IRS.8\nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s husband was diagnosed with HIV. Applicant was also diagnosed three\nmonths later. In six months she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. She contracted the conditions from\nher husband. She had chemotherapy for 50 weeks. She traveled 150 miles for that treatment. She did\nnot miss work and paid her bills. She used her credit cards to help pay for some bills.9\nShe lived with her parents during the separation before her divorce because her husband\nwould not leave the marital home although Applicant paid the monthly mortgage.  Her husband had\n10\na drug problem. They finally divorced in July 2007.  After the divorce, her ex-husband stole some\nchecks from Applicant. Her husband also had not paid the utility bills and Applicant found herself\nresponsible for another $400 of debt.\nApplicant is now living in her home with her youngest daughter who is 12 years old. She has\n$25,000 left on the mortgage and approximately $60,000 in equity. She does not receive regular\nchild support payments, although she is entitled to it by court order, because her ex-husband does\nnot work.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $8,000. She earns approximately $3,100\nnet per month working a regular schedule. She has a net remainder per month of approximately\n$800.  She is current on her monthly bills and owns her automobile.\n11\n\nThe File contains a letter from Applicant dated June 29, 2007 explaining the medical bills and a garnishment\n12\nfrom wages for most of them. Her daughter had so many medical bills that some of them were unknown to Applicant.\nAX B (Letter from Employer)\n13\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n14\n4\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nTax Lien                     $6,054\nPayment plan  $248\nAX B\n1.b\nMedical account       $54\nUnknown\nTr. 57\n1.c\nMedical account       $474\nSettlement plan\nAX B\n1.d\nCollection account    $233\nPAID\nAX B, Tr. 52\n1.e\nCollection account    $503\nPlan for Repayment\nAX A \n1.f\nCollection account    $756\nUnknown\nTr. 64.\n1.g\nMedical account        $1,936\nDuplicate\nLetter 6/29/0712\n1.h\nCredit account           $1608\nPlan for Repayment\nAX B; Tr. 64\n1.I\nCell phone                  $198\nPAID\nAX B\n1.j\nBankruptcy 1989 \nDischarged 1994\nGX 3\nApplicant is highly regarded by her employer. The President of the contractor company\nhighlights the ethical and moral behavior of Applicant, as well as impressive skills. She manages five\nemployees and is responsible for direct deposit of a  payroll which averages $200,000 biweekly. The\npresident is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. He attests to her capability with additional\nresponsibilities in his absence. She has a stellar attendance record despite her medical and personal\nissues.13\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n15\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\u00b62 (a)(1)-(9).\n16\n Id.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n21\n5\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n15\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n16\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n17\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.18\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n19\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n20\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n21\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n22\n6\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.22\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $8,000. She admits there are still outstanding debts, and\nher 2007 credit report confirms her alleged debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does partially apply\nbecause Applicant's difficulty with finances in 1989 has been resolved through her Chapter 13\nbankruptcy and payment plan in approximately 1994. The debt that accrued after that time was in large\nmeasure due to emergency medical situations and her husband's inability to handle money. Applicant\nis now divorced and she has been diligent in paying debts over the years. Her health is now stable and\nshe lives within her means.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are the result of medical problems for her daughter and herself. She also\ndivorced her second husband because he did not support the family financially, squandered money and\neven stole checks from Applicant after the divorce. Her first husband died and left her to support\nherself and her son with few work skills. Applicant filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy as a result and paid\nall her creditors through the repayment plan which ended in the mid 1990's. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG \u00b6 20\u00a9 (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control); FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue)  \nApplicant has received some  financial counseling from her boss and developed a structured\nplan to resolve these debts. She has an arrangement with the IRS to pay the lien; she has paid several\nof the debts and is researching the unknown medical accounts. She is researching the debts to locate\nthe collection companies. Her resolve and determination as shown through her successful Chapter 13\n\n7\nrepayments are evident.  There are clear indications that the financial problem is being resolved or is\nunder control.\nAfter her daughter was born with a medical problem, Applicant was faced with numerous\nmedical bills. This contributed to her inability to pay on her older debt. She paid her medical bills and\nprovided for her family. Applicant has a job with a good, stable income. She divorced her second\nhusband.  She has a solid plan and the determination to resolve her debts. She has made good faith\nefforts to resolve all her delinquencies.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Applicant has a very good work history and  review from her employer. She\nprovides for her family and her daughter who have major medical problems. Her inability to initially\nstay on hers repayment plan did not cause her to give up. She has made good faith efforts to resolve\nher delinquent debts. The issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her\noutstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 3, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 26, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non January 7, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 9, 2008.  DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on January 15, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 21, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which\n\n2\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until February 29, 2008, to submit additional matters.  On February 25,\n2008, he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on February 29, 2008. The record closed on February 29,\n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 39, single and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a network security manager and seeks to retain a\nsecurity clearance previously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.  These two debts are actually part of the same debt\nto the same financial institution (Credit Union).

(Transcript at 27-43.)\nSince that time the Applicant has repeatedly attempted to reach a resolution with\neither the Credit Union or its collection agencies.  The Applicant spoke at great length\nabout his problems with how the Credit Union and the collection agencies have handled\nhis account.  He submitted written evidence confirming that, on several occasions, he\nhas made reasonable offers to resolve this situation.  His most recent written offer was\nmade on February 6, 2007.  He last spoke with the financial institution about this debt\nabout two weeks before the hearing.  The Applicant is willing to resolve this dispute, and\nhas the money to do so, but no one will work with him to resolve the situation.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 2-6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 3-8; Transcript at 50-55, 76-83,\n90-98.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant has consistently denied that he has ever had\nan account with Bank One, or that he owes any money to this creditor.  Once again, the\nApplicant thoroughly documented his attempts since at least 2004 to resolve this\n\nThere are three credit reports in evidence.  Both debts in the SOR are referenced in Government Exhibit 4, dated March\n1\n10, 2006.  The Applicant disputed the Credit Union account and it was removed from his credit file, as shown in\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, dated September 30, 2006; and Government Exhibit 3, dated December 11, 2007.  The Bank One\ndebt does appear in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, but not in Government Exhibit 3.\n3\nsituation.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-8; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B and F at 10-12;\nTranscript at 43-49, 56-70.)1\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted evidence showing that on at least one occasion his\nidentity has been confused with someone else\u2019s concerning other debts.  (Government\nExhibit 2 at 13-14; Transcript at 49-50, 66-70.)\nThe Applicant is a member of the Reserves, as well as working for a Defense\ncontractor.  He submitted documentation from his Armed Service showing that he is a\nrespected non-commissioned officer who is considered to have great potential.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D and E.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. In addition, there is some documentary evidence showing\nthat he may owe the debt in subparagraph 1.c.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Almost ten\nyears ago, the Applicant got into a reasonable dispute with the Credit Union, a dispute\nhe has been totally unable to resolve, despite his best efforts.  I find the behavior\noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not\nraise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The\nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant\nnever denied he owed the Credit Union some amount of money.  To the best of his\nability over several years he attempted to resolve this situation without success.  With\nregards to Bank One, he has consistently denied having an account with them or owing\nthem money, and thoroughly documented his disputes about that debt.  I conclude\nthese potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  As set forth at length above, the\nApplicant has a legitimate dispute with both creditors.  He has thoroughly documented\nhis efforts to resolve these debts.  This mitigating condition clearly applies to the facts of\nthis case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a good credit\nhistory, with the exception of the debts of concern here.  He has legitimate disputes with\nthese creditors, and has behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve\n\n6\nthem.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)8)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 51-year-old lead member of the engineering staff employed by a defense\ncontractor.  His mother, two brothers, two sisters, mother-in-law, two sisters in law, four brothers\nin law, plus all of their children and spouses, are citizens and residents of Algeria.  He failed to show\nthere is little likelihood that his relationship with his family could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation.  He also holds an Algerian passport that is valid until March 2009.  He has used this\npassport four times since becoming a U.S. citizen to travel to Algeria.  His conduct is indicative of\na foreign preference because he is exercising the rights of an Algerian citizen.  He failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns about foreign preference and foreign influence.  Clearance is denied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated September 23, 2005).\n1\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006)\n2\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service,\n802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 23, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), (e-\nQIP) version.   The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue\n1\na security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 13, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline C (Foreign Preferences) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 20, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 3, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on August 28, 2007.  Applicant filed a motion for continuance on August 22,\n2007, which was denied the same day.  I convened a hearing on September 12, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.  The government offered two exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-2.  Applicant offered nine\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits A-I.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the record\nopen until September 24, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.  On the\nafternoon of September 24, 2007, Applicant faxed a motion requesting additional time, because he\nhad only received the transcript that day.  The motion was denied because he was given 12 additional\ndays to supplement the record, his having the transcript was not required for him to prepare and file\nevidence discussed at the hearing, and he waited until the very last minute to file his motion.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on September 20, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Administrative Exhibits\nA1 through A11.  Applicant stated he had no objection and the administrative exhibits were\nadmitted. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.   The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice\n2\n\nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing 15types of administrative notice).\n3\nTr. at 18, 21.\n4\nId. at 18-20.\n5\nId. at 20.\n6\nId. at 23-27.\n7\nId. at 28-32.\n8\nId. at 32-34.\n9\n4\nfacts that are either well known or from government reports.   I took administrative notice of various\n3\nfacts derived from Administrative Exhibits A1 through A11, as indicated under subheading\n\u201cAlgeria\u201d of this decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 51-year-old lead member of the engineering staff employed by a federal\ncontractor.   He is married and has three children.  He emigrated to the United States in 1977.  He\n4\nbecame a naturalized citizen in 2000, and his wife in 2005.   He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical\n5\nEngineering from an American university.  He has had no military service, and this is his first\napplication for a security clearance.6\nApplicant\u2019s mother, age 81, is a citizen and resident of Algeria.  She lives in an apartment\nthat he purchased for her.  He and his family also stay there when they have traveled to Algeria.  His\nwife also stayed there for a period of time while she was waiting for her U.S. immigration papers to\nbe approved.  She is retired living on a pension from the government.  The property is in Applicant\u2019s\nname, but his mother pays the annual real estate taxes.7\nApplicant\u2019s older brother, a citizen and resident of Algeria, has a law degree, has practiced\nlaw, taught at a university, and is an elected representative in the national assembly.  His wife also\nhas a law degree, but presently is a housewife.  They have six children, two or three attending a\nuniversity.  Applicant has contact with him, about six times a year, usually during religious holidays,\ntalking about each other\u2019s families.  He last saw his brother in 2006, when he traveled to his father-\nin-law\u2019s funeral.8\nAnother brother, also a citizen and resident of Algeria, teaches computer science at a\nuniversity.  He is married, his wife is a teacher, and they have three children, all under the age of 19.9\nApplicant sister a citizen and resident of Algeria, is married, and has six or seven children.\nHer husband is retired, but formerly worked as a custodian at a university.

She is married, and her husband\nformerly did construction work in a European country, but is now retired.  He believes that his\nbrother-in-law receives a pension from his company.10\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, lives with one of her sons.  One sister-in-law, a housewife, is\nmarried and her husband teaches at a high school.  A brother-in-law teaches at the university, and\nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to him, maybe six times a year.  His wife talks with her mother frequently to\ninquire about her health.  Another brother-in-law works in construction.  Another brother-in-law\nteaches at a university, and his final brother-in-law is a high school principal.  Another sister-in-law\nis a housewife.  All of these persons are citizens and residents of Algeria.11\nApplicant saw most of his and his wife\u2019s family when he and his wife returned to Algeria\nin 2006 for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral.  During part of the trip, he used his Algerian passport.  His\nfamily traveled to Algeria in 2004 and December 2001.  He used his Algerian passport to enter and\nexit the Algeria, and his U.S. passport to exit and enter the United States.  He maintains the\n12\nAlgerian passport for his own convenience, and it expires on March 15, 2009.   He was unwilling\n13\nto renounce his Algerian citizenship.14\nApplicant and his wife own a home in the United States, his wife does not work outside the\nhome, he votes in US elections, he has a 401(k) plan with his employer, checking and savings\naccounts, he owns mutual funds, and he participates in a professional association.  He has attended\nsome of the parent-teacher group meetings at his children\u2019s school.15\nApplicant\u2019s manager submitted a statement about him, having known Applicant since he\njoined the company in September 2005.  He characterizes Applicant as a \u201cdedicated and\nconscientious employee,\u201d and has significantly contributed to several programs.  He has received\nonly positive feedback from Applicant\u2019s colleagues and team leads for which he has worked.\nApplicant is described as technically capable, dedicated to the programs he is assigned, and a solid\nteam player who possesses excellent interpersonal and communications skills.  \u201cHe keeps me\ninformed of his schedule and progress on the programs to which he is assigned, and is always willing\nto help where needed.  He is a person of strong character and an upstanding individual.\u201d16\nApplicant made the following statement:\n\nConsular Information Sheet - Algeria, United States Department of State, dated March 7, 2007, at 1; Background Note:\n17\nAlgeria, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, United States Department of State, dated February 2007 at 4; Algeria: Current\nIssues, Congressional Research Service (CR5) Report for Congress, Library of Congress, dated February 16, 2005, at\n1-2; Press Statement, US.

It was by choice that I\ndecided to raise my family here.  The fact that I was born in Algeria, and have\ninherited the citizenship from my parents is something that I was just born with.  I\nmean, when it came to make choices, I clearly made my choices by staying here and\nbecoming a U. S. citizen and raising my family here.  As far as the family links in\nAlgeria, those also are inherent issues that naturalized US citizens would have.  The\nfact that I still have siblings and a mother that live there, that is not something that\nI can do much about.  As a matter of fact, quite a few of them would want nothing\nbetter than to emigrate here, but that\u2019s not a possibility.  One of the requests that we\nget every now and then from some of these people is applying or helping them apply\nfor the DV program, which is the immigration program, so they have no ill feelings\ntoward the United States.  One of the popular places in the capital of Algeria is\nnamed after Senator Kennedy, because of the esteem that they have for him there.\nAs I pointed out earlier, I\u2019ve been here for 30 years, I got all my degrees here, I\u2019ve\nbeen working for 16 to 17 years in the industry, and I haven\u2019t had any problems or\nissues that could be detrimental to the interests of this country.\nALGERIA\nAlgeria is a multi-party constitutional republic that has suffered from domestic terrorism\nthroughout the 1 990s and into the present .  The Algerian government declared a state of\n17\nemergency in 1992, which remains in effect to the present day, due to what government authorities\ncall \u201cpersistent terrorism.\u201d   Although making modest efforts toward democratic progress, Algeria\u2019s\n18\n15 -year-old state of emergency, has been reportedly used to justified governmental abuses of human\nrights.   According to a 2006 United States Department of State report on human rights practices\n19\nin Algeria, the government continued to fail to account for thousands of persons who disappeared\nin detention in the 1 990s.   Further, there were other significant human rights violations regarding\n20\nabuse and torture, corruption and lack of government transparency, official impunity, prolonged pre-\ntrial detention, as well as other due process issues.   Restrictions on civil liberties such as privacy,\n21\nfreedom of speech, press, assembly, association and movement were also recorded, as were\nlimitations on religious freedom, including increased regulation of non-Muslim worship.

Of these, Al-Qaeda is the terrorist organization that\n26\npresents the greatest threat to United States interests, including the Homeland.   Al-Qaeda continues\n27\nto plot attacks against the United States and maintains active connections with affiliates throughout\nthe Middle East and northern Africa, now to include Algeria.   Moreover, terrorist threats to the U.S.\n28\nremain the pre-eminent challenge to the intelligence community.29\nA recent upsurge in terrorist attacks has only increased the United States Government\nconcerns.\nWithin Algeria, terrorist groups have targeted foreigners and remained active around\n30  \n31 \nthe southern regions and borders of the country where approximately 1,100 American citizens live\n32 \nand work in oil and gas fields.33\nAlthough the United States has worked with the Algerian government to help combat\nterrorism in that country,\nthe Algerian government projects inconsistent policies regarding its\n34 \nposition on international terrorism, which are often in conflict with the United States.

Moreover, Algeria\n37\nis now considered to be a source of international terrorists, and many Algerian terrorists have been\narrested in counter-terrorism operations in Europe and the United States.38\nAlgeria and the United States signed a treaty in 1795, and have carried on a mostly friendly\nrelations.  Since that time.  In the 1980s, it was Algeria that helped negotiate the release of the U.S.\nIranian hostages, and more recently, Algeria as human assistance in fighting the war on terrorism.39\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n40\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates\n41\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant\nhas met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n42\n9\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n40\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).41\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.42\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n43\n10\nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d\nstating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nor foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country,\nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.43\nApplicant has extensive family living in Algeria.  His mother, two brothers, two sisters, mother-in-\nlaw, two sisters in law, four brothers in law, plus all of their children and spouses, being citizens and\nresidents of Algeria, creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because\nof the terrorist activities in Algeria.  A heightening factor is the fact that Applicant\u2019s mother receives\na government pension that is her sole means of living.  She lives in an apartment that was paid for\nby him, which he still owns, and they have weekly contact by phone, in addition to personal visits.\nThe most important heightened risk factor is Applicant\u2019s older brother, who is a delegate in the\nnational assembly.  They have contact about six times a year.  Some of his other relatives are\nteachers, but is unclear what is the source of most family incomes.  The burden rests on Applicant\nto show that these are not concerns.  Several of his in-laws have contacts with either local or national\ngovernment that put his family at risk, either for their salary, professional position, or other benefit.\nIn addition to terrorism is the concern about the Algerian government\u2019s human rights abuses,\nwith thousands of people disappearing while in detention in the 1990s.  On the other hand, there has\nbeen some cooperation between the United States government and Algeria on combating terrorism,\nhowever at the same time, Algeria has very interesting distinctions as to what it qualifies as terrorists\nbecause on the one hand there are some terrorist groups that they oppose, on the other hand, there\n\n11\nare officials distinguishing between terrorism and what they consider to be legitimate armed\nresistance by recognized terrorist groups such as Hamas, the Palestinians, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah,\nand others in the Palestinian occupied territories.\nThe Government\u2019s concern is that Applicant has dozens of family members who live and\nwork in Algeria.  There is no evidence that any of these family members have done anything wrong\nor illegal.  Nonetheless, they are at very real risk, given today\u2019s circumstances and the world\u2019s\ncircumstances.  His connections to his mother, his siblings, and his wife\u2019s family also creates a\npotential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a heightened risk\nfor a potential conflict between helping or protecting a loved one and protecting classified\ninformation.\nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying conditions, and\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  As previously\nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable\nto these disqualifying conditions:\n((a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation; and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they\nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual.\nGuideline  \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) applies to his relationships with his mother, siblings, and in-\nlaws and extended families.  His contacts with these persons are frequent, and not casual, given the\nownership of property, the fact his mother lives there, he and his family use the property when\ntraveling to Algeria, and he has traveled to Algeria four times since becoming a U.S. citizen.  These\nvery frequent contacts do not mitigate the security concerns because it is likely Applicant could be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between his family and the interests of the United States.\nHe did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his\nfamily] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship\nand loyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\n\n12\ninterest.  He has lived in the United States for 30 years.  He is a U.S. citizen.  He received his college\neducation in U.S. colleges and universities.  However, he owns property in Algeria.  It could\npotentially be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure him.  Guideline \u00b6 8(f) does not apply.\nApplicant has strong contacts and linkage to the United States, but his continued linkage to Algeria\nis problematic.  Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, these facts are insufficient\nto overcome the security concerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nGuideline \u00b6 9. The Concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuideline \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen\nor through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a\nforeign country.\nGuideline \u00b6 11. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the\nindividual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated; and\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States Government.\nApplicant possessed an Algerian passport that is valid until March 2009.  He used the\npassport in the summer of 2006, July 2004, December 2001, and September 2000, in lieu of his U.S.\npassport.  He used it prior to that, but that was before he was a U.S. citizen.  He has had multiple\nuses after becoming a citizen.  Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 10 (a) (1) and (3) apply.  The benefit is the ability to\ntravel on that passport, and so the possession itself is disqualifying.  He was born in Algeria, which\nis mitigated by Guideline \u00b6 11 (a), the dual citizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship and\nhis birth in Algeria.  There has been no expression of willingness to renounce his citizenship, and\n\nISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007).\n46\n13\nno evidence that the passport is required by his employer.  There is no evidence that the passport has\nbeen surrendered to a cognizant security authority, such as the facility security officer, nor has it been\ninvalidated or destroyed.  His conduct is indicative of a foreign preference because he is exercising\nthe rights of an Algerian citizen, rights a person who is solely a U.S. citizen would not be able to do.\nThe mitigating conditions of Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 11 (b) through (e) are not applicable, and I conclude\nGuideline C against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not\nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the\nJudge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances.\u201d   The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are\n44\nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve misconduct,\nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant\nof the nine APFs to this adjudication.   In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable\n45\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall\ncommon sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s\npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or\nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by\nthe facts of a given case.\u201d46\nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nApplicant has lived in the United States for 30 years.  His wife and children are U.S. citizens.  He\nowns property, has investments, savings and checking accounts, votes in elections, attends in his\nchildren\u2019s school functions, and is active in a professional association.  There is no evidence he has\never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States.  He takes his loyalty\nto the United States very seriously, and has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several\n\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990). \n47\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n48\n14\nyears.  No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance or produced any derogatory\ninformation about him.\nThe circumstances that weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis are: (1) he has\nfrequent and non-casual contacts with his family who currently live and reside in Algeria, and he\ntalks to his mother frequently.  These contacts are manifestations of a strong affection and regard for\nhis family; (2) he owns property in Algeria; (3), his brother is a delegate in the national assembly of\nAlgeria; and (4), his frequent travels to Algeria, using his Algerian passport.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against\ngranting a security clearance.  Whenever any doubt is raised, it is deemed best to err on the side of\nthe government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d   After\n47\nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context\nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to\nforeign influence and foreign preference.  This is a close case, but ultimately the evidence leaves me\ndoubts about his security suitability.\nI state again that my decision in no way questions Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or\npatriotism.  I make the decision based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors  and supporting evidence,\n48\nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guidelines.  Applicant has not overcome or successfully mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s case.  For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 3, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge on November 1, 2007, and reassigned to me on November 28, 2007. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on November 28, 2007, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on December 19, 2007, at Woodland Hills, California. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant stipulated to the admissibility of government \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and the exhibits were admitted.

She used her \nU.S. passport on all her travel, including her trips to Taiwan in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, \n2003, and 2005. Applicant realized that possession of a foreign passport could be a \nconcern. She provided the passport to her security officer who destroyed it on \nNovember 16, 2007. She sent a letter to the Taipei Economics and Cultural Office in \nLos Angeles on November 26, 2007, formally renouncing her Taiwanese citizenship.4 \n \n \nApplicant has never voted in Taiwan. She has voted in U.S. elections. She has \nno foreign assets. She has U.S. assets consistent with her background as a 26-year-old \nengineer.5 Applicant\u2019s evaluations have been excellent. Character letters describe her \nas a woman of integrity with good moral fiber, mature, responsible, honest, diligent, and \nethical. She is recommended for a security clearance.6 \n \nTaiwan and PRC \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC \ndoes not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n2 Tr. at 34, 38-39, 42, 45, 73-74; GE 1, 3; AE C, H. \n \n3 Tr. at 37; GE 1, 3. \n \n4 Tr. at 28-29, 46-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A, B. \n \n5 Tr. at 51, 61. \n \n6 AE C-H. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and \nsound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, \nagricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology \ngoods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole \nlegal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the \nconduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan, a private \nnonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue visas, accept \npassport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart \norganization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the \nUnited States would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a \nsubstantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine \naircraft, and diesel submarines. The White House also was more accommodating to \nvisits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. Administrations, and permitted visits \nfrom Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president and defense \nminister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to \nhave dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \n \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \na billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \nBoth the PRC and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic \nintelligence. The PRC also maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 7(a), Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG & 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of \nTaiwan, a country known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. This \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG && 7(a) and (b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant was born in the U.S., but spent much of her childhood in Taiwan. She \nhas lived here since she was 16 years old. She graduated from high school and college \nin the United States, and is attending graduate school. Her younger brother has also \nbeen here since 1997. He was not born in the U.S., but became a citizen in 2005. \nApplicant renounced her Taiwanese citizenship. Her life, career, brother, and assets all \nlie in the United States. Her father lives in Taiwan. He is a college professor with no \ndirect connection to the Taiwanese government. He is an honest loving father and \nworks in a completely different field than Applicant. Taiwan collects U.S. intelligence, as \ndoes other U.S. allies. It does not have a poor human rights record and there is no \nindication that it uses coercion in its intelligence operations. I find it unlikely that \nApplicant would ever be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof Taiwan or her father and the interests of the U.S. I further find there is no conflict of \ninterest, because Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin America, that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG && 8(a) and (b) are applicable. No other mitigating condition is \napplicable. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \nApplicant possessed a Taiwanese passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 10(a) \napplied at one point. The renewal of her Taiwanese passport while a U.S. citizen could \nraise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of her Taiwanese \ncitizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nApplicant was considered a Taiwanese citizen because her parents were citizens \nof Taiwan. She actively exercised her Taiwanese citizenship by renewing a Taiwanese \npassport that she never used. The passport was destroyed and Applicant formally \napplied to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in the U.S. to \nTaiwanese parents. Her parents took her to Taiwan when she was three years old. She \nspent much of her youth in Taiwan. She returned with her younger brother to the U.S. \nwhen she was 16. He became a U.S. citizen in 2005. He is a student and lives with \nApplicant. She was educated here and her career is here. She is now a highly regarded \nengineer doing important work for a defense contractor.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan. Taiwan is an ally of \nthe United States. However, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d7 The distinctions between friendly and \nunfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can \nshift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly.  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights record, and has a \nvery aggressive espionage program. The U.S. officially supports the \u201cone China\u201d policy. \nHowever, to treat the PRC and Taiwan the same is to ignore reality. They currently \nfunction as separate entities. That is not to say that the PRC is irrelevant to this case. \nThe PRC conducts intelligence operations in Taiwan. The threat to Taiwan from the \nPRC is real. It is this threat that is the impetus to Taiwan\u2019s defense spending. It also \nprovides motivation for Taiwan\u2019s intelligence gathering. The threat from the PRC also \nprovides motivation for Taiwan to keep the U.S. as a friend, as it is dependent on the \nU.S. for its arms and defense.  \n \n \nTaiwan is a democracy, does not have a poor human rights record, and is \ndependent upon the United States for arms, as well as its defense against the PRC. \nTaiwan is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, but there \nis no indication that Taiwan utilizes coercion against its citizens for espionage purposes. \nMany of our allies conduct intelligence gathering against the U.S. Taiwan would be \nrisking a great deal by raising the stakes, and attempting to use duress against one of \nits citizens in an attempt to coerce a U.S. citizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s father \nis also not a good candidate for coercion as he is not dependent upon the government \nof Taiwan.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her Foreign \nInfluence and Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn November 4, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance for his employment\nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On July 26, 2007, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nMarch 11, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline B (foreign\n2\ninfluence), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. On August 27, 2007, pursuant to paragraph E3.1.7 of Enclosure 3 of the\nDirective, Department Counsel timely requested a hearing to resolve this matter. The\ncase was assigned to me on November 2, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held\non December 11, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\neight exhibits (Gx. 1 - 8) and two witnesses. Department Counsel also asked that I take\nadministrative notice of the information contained in a pre-hearing submission submitted\non or about October 23, 2007, and included in the record as Judicial Exhibit (Jx.) I.\nApplicant testified in his own behalf and offered 16 documents sorted by subject matter\nand admitted as Appellant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - D. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nDecember 28, 2007.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b61.a that Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his response to e-QIP question 11 (\u201cYour Employment Activities\u201d)\nby omitting his employment at a gas station and convenience store in March 2000. In\nSOR \u00b61.b, the government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his response to e-QIP\nquestion 23 (\u201cYour Police Record\u201d) by answering \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting the fact he was\narrested in March 2000 and charged with attempted obstruction of justice and unlawful\nsale of alcohol to a minor. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was placed on 12\nmonths probation and fined. In SOR \u00b61.c, the government alleged Applicant deliberately\ngave a false material statement during an October 31, 2005, interview with a U.S. Army\ninvestigator by denying he had ever been arrested or charged with any crime. In SOR\n\u00b61.d, the government alleged Applicant also deliberately gave a false material statement\nwhen during the same interview when he omitted his March 2000 gas station\nemployment. In SOR \u00b61.e, the government alleged Applicant gave a false name to a\npeace officer during his March 2000 arrest.\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in SOR \u00b62.a the arrest Applicant\nomitted in response to e-QIP question 11. In SOR \u00b62.b, the government alleged his\ndeliberate falsifications of material fact alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a - 1.d constituted criminal\nconduct in violation Title 18, United States Code, \u00a71001.\nUnder Guideline B, the government alleged in SOR \u00b63.a that Applicant\u2019s brother-\nin-law is a retired Egyptian Army officer, who is a citizen of and resides in Egypt. Under\nSOR \u00b63.b, the government alleged Applicant traveled to Egypt in 2004, but that his U.S.\npassport does not have a visa issued by the Egyptian government.\n\n3\nApplicant admitted, albeit with explanation, all of the SOR allegations. His\nresponses to the Guideline E allegations admit the facts alleged but deny the intent\nrequired to make his statements disqualifying. After a thorough review of the pleadings,\ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in Egypt in May 1951. He came to the United States in 1977\nafter receiving a college degree in accounting, and he became a U.S. citizen in May\n1983. Applicant married his wife, who was also born and raised in Egypt, in July 1981.\nShe became a U.S. citizen August 1989. Applicant and his wife have one child, age 24,\nwho was born and raised in the United States. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased, but had come to the U.S. and were naturalized\ncitizens when they died. His three brothers and one sister came to the U.S. before he\narrived, and all are naturalized U.S. citizens. Appellant\u2019s wife has one brother who is a\ncitizen of and still resides in Egypt. He is a retired Egyptian Army officer with whom\nApplicant speaks about once a year. Applicant last saw his brother-in-law in 2004, when\nthe latter came to the U.S. to see Applicant\u2019s wife. (Tr. 114 - 115) Applicant has no\npersonal contacts or financial interests in Egypt, and he has returned there twice since\n1977, once in 1981 to get married and most recently in 2004 to visit a seaside resort.\nHe used his U.S. passport for all of his foreign travel and does not hold a foreign\npassport. (Tr. 115 - 117)\nEgypt and the United States maintain friendly relations. The U.S. provides Egypt\na great deal of financial and military support. Both countries are closely aligned in the\nglobal war on terror (GWOT) and in efforts to maintain stability in the Middle East. Egypt\nhas a nominally democratic government consisting of an executive branch, a bicameral\nlegislature, and an increasingly independent judiciary. However, one party has held an\noverriding majority in the government since 1978, and only recently were open elections\nheld. The U.S. State Department has observed that Egyptian citizens have no\nmeaningful opportunity to change their government. While Egypt has been aggressive\nin counterterrorism efforts, its domestic human rights record has been poor. Law\nenforcement and executive organizations have employed arbitrary arrests and torture in\nthe name of rooting out terrorists and other enemies of the state. The results include\ndeaths while in custody, disappearances while in custody, and suppression of anti-\ngovernment expressions. The primary threat of intelligence gathering and espionage\nagainst the United States from Egypt results not from the Egyptian government, but\nfrom the activities of terrorist organizations trying to operate there. (Jx. I)\nApplicant\u2019s Egyptian name can be difficult for Americans to either understand or\npronounce, so he has \u201cAmericanized\u201d his name as \u201c------------.\u201d However, he has not\nlegally changed his name, and his Egyptian name is the only name that appears on his\npassport. (Gx. 6) It is also the only name he listed on his e-QIP even though e-QIP\nSection 5 specifically asked him to list other names he has used. (Gx. 1)\nIn March 2000, Applicant was working as a cashier at a gas station convenience\nstore. It was one of three jobs he held at the time as he and his wife were trying to\nresolve some financial difficulties. On March 11, 2000, he sold beer to an underage\nfemale who turned out to be working for the police as part of a sting operation. In order\n\n4\nto complete the citation against Applicant, a uniformed officer asked  him for some\nidentification. Applicant stated he did not have his driver\u2019s license or other form of\nidentification with him, so the officer asked for his name, address, phone number, and\nsocial security number. Applicant stated his name was Sam Nelson, but he did not\nexplain that it was not his legal name. Additionally, the rest of the personal information\nhe provided was false. He did not want to provide accurate information because he was\nafraid of losing his job. He was then given a citation for selling alcohol to a minor under\n21. (Gx. 4; Tr. 30 - 41, 95 - 100, 121 - 129)\nOn March 13, 2000, the police returned to the convenience store after they\ndetermined he had tried to deceive them. He immediately produced his driver\u2019s license\nwith the information the police had asked for the day before. He was arrested,\nhandcuffed and taken to jail, where he was charged with obstruction of justice. Through\na plea agreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to both charges, was fined and placed on\nprobation for 12 months. (Gx. 3) After Applicant completed the terms of his sentence, he\npetitioned to have the record of his arrest expunged. (Ax. D)\nIn October 2005, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor for work as an\nArabic translator for military personnel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and for U.S. military\nforces in Iraq. His work required a security clearance, for which he applied in November\n2005 by submitting an e-QIP. In response to e-QIP questions in Section 11 (\u201cYour\nEmployment Activities\u201d), he did not list his employment at the convenience store in\nMarch 2000. He explained in his answer to the SOR and in his testimony that he\nthought he did not have to list any employment less than 90 days in duration. (Answer\nto SOR; Tr. 106 - 107) In response to e-QIP questions in Section 23 (\u201cYour Police\nRecord\u201d) he omitted the information about his convictions for selling alcohol to a minor\nand for obstruction of justice. Applicant has explained he either did not understand the\nquestion or thought that, because his record had been expunged he did not have to\ndisclose the information. (Tr. 103 - 106)\nIn October 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a U.S. Army counterintelligence\nagent as part of a background investigation to determine whether Applicant should be\ngiven a clearance so he could work as a Category 2 linguist overseas. Applicant failed\nto disclose to the agent his March 2000 employment at the convenience store or his\nconvictions for obstruction and selling alcohol to a minor. In his interview, he denied any\nadverse involvement with law enforcement. (Gx. 5; Tr. 47 - 62)\nApplicant worked as a translator in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and in Iraq until July\n2007. His performance at both locations was excellent. Several members of the military\nchain of command where he was assigned spoke highly of his dedication and reliability.\n(Ax. B) Before working for a defense contractor, he worked in various social services\njobs and worked a second job at a home for the mentally challenged. His work in those\njobs earned him equally high praise. (Ax. A)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18, and Guideline E (personal conduct)\nat AG \u00b6 15.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n5\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.6\n\n6\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence. Applicant\u2019s contacts overseas may pose a security concern\nbecause, as stated in AG \u00b66,\n[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b63. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, a former Egyptian Army officer, still lives in and is a\ncitizen of Egypt. Applicant has had little contact with him since Applicant became a U.S.\ncitizen. Applicant has no other personal or financial interests outside the U.S. and has\nonly returned to Egypt twice since 1977. The facts presented here make applicable the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b67(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion). \nAlso applicable are the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b68(a) (the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign  individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), AG\n\u00b68(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest), and AG \u00b68(c)(contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation). From 1981 to the present, Applicant has seen his brother-in-law perhaps\nthree times and only speaks with him at most once a year. Further, all of Applicant\u2019s\npersonal and financial interests have been in the U.S. for 30 years. On balance, the\nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts are mitigated.\nPersonal Conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct may be a security concern because, as stated in\nAG \u00b6 15,\n\n7\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe government\u2019s information supports the allegations that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified his responses to e-QIP questions about his employment and criminal conduct,\nthat he gave false information to the police, and that he tried to mislead an Army\ninvestigator by omitting information about his employment history and by denying\nadverse involvement with law enforcement. As to his omissions from his security\nquestionnaire of employment history and criminal record information, his argument that\nhe misunderstood the questions or thought he did not have to list an arrest that was\nexpunged finances, without more may seem plausible. However, along with Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate attempts to mislead police and an Army investigator, the record reflects a\npattern of deliberate dishonesty intended to protect his own interests. Available\ninformation makes applicable the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b616(b) (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative).\nBy contrast, the record does not warrant consideration of any of the mitigating\nconditions listed in AG \u00b617. Applicant did not promptly correct any of the false\nstatements he has made. Nor can his conduct be viewed as minor, because of the\ngovernment\u2019s compelling interest in ensuring it has all of the information needed to\nmake an accurate and fair assessment of a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. In turn, a key aspect of that suitability is a person\u2019s honesty, even when\nfaced with unpleasant or adverse circumstances. Available information shows Applicant\nwill resort to deception whenever faced with adverse personal circumstances. Such\nconduct bears directly on his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. Accordingly,\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his personal conduct.\nCriminal Conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct may be a security concern because, as stated in AG\n\u00b630, \n[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government submitted sufficient information to support the allegations that\nhe engaged in criminal conduct in March 2000 and in November 2005. After being\nconvicted in 2000 of trying to impede the state\u2019s ability to enforce its laws by deliberately\nproviding false information to the police, Applicant repeated his conduct in 2005 by\ntrying to impede the government\u2019s ability to assess his suitability for access to classified\ninformation. His conduct in 2000 was a violation of his state\u2019s criminal code (Gx. 8), and\nhis conduct his 2005 was a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. Available information requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b631(a) (a single serious crime or\n\n See footnote 6, supra. \n7\n8\nmultiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted).\nI have also reviewed the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b632; however, the\nrecord does not warrant consideration of any of them. Available adverse information\ngoes directly to Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Because the\npersonal references who have recommended Applicant for a position of trust do not\nappear to have knowledge of the adverse information in his background, the favorable\ninformation about his work performance and reliability does not have sufficient\npersuasive value to overcome the security concerns about his criminal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines B, E, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b62(a). Applicant is 56\nyears old and has spent most of his adult life as a productive citizen of the United States\nsince arriving from Egypt more than 30 years ago. His work as a translator in support of\nthe U.S. military has been outstanding. His co-workers, friends, and superiors feel he is\nreliable and trustworthy. However, he has tried to conceal information the government\nneeds to accurately assess his ability and willingness to protect the national interests as\nhis own. Such dishonesty is not isolated because he had also tried to deceive civilian\nauthorities a few years earlier when faced with misdemeanor criminal charges. His\nconduct is directly at odds with the fundamental tenets of the personnel security\nprogram, in that Applicant has a history of lying to protect his own interests at the\nexpense of the government\u2019s compelling interest in protecting classified information.\nThat he has done so even when faced with possible criminal penalties only reinforces\nthe government\u2019s concerns. Available information tends to show he will repeat this\nconduct in the future. Accordingly, significant doubts persist about whether Applicant is\nsuitable for access to classified information. Because protection of the national interest\nis paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\nnational interest.  \n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 3, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.b:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On January 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nF, E and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receiving the SOR, answered the SOR in writing on \nApril 11, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on April 14, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non May 20, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 27, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 1, \n2008.

Two years later, on September 11, 1997, \n \n1GE 1 (Security Clearance application) at 1-2; Tr. 17. \n \n2GE 1, supra note 1, at 3-5; Tr. 17-21. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe court dismissed this case. Five days later, Applicant and his wife filed a second \nChapter 13 petition for bankruptcy. On November 11, 1999, the bankruptcy court \ndischarged their debts.3 \n \n \nJust over one year later, on December 29, 2000, Applicant and his wife again \nfiled a Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy, which the court dismissed on July 6, 2001. \nImmediately thereafter, on July 10, 2001, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 \npetition for bankruptcy. The court discharged all his debts on November 29, 2001.4 \n \n \nApproximately two and one-half years later, Applicant and his wife filed their \nfourth Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy, which the court administratively dismissed on \nJuly 7, 2004. Three days later, Applicant and his wife filed their fifth Chapter 13 petition \nfor bankruptcy, which the court dismissed on January 24, 2005 when they did not \ncomply with the payment terms of their Chapter 13 plan. Applicant states that the \nrepayment plan had been based on two incomes and that because his income had \ndeclined significantly because of his injury, he could not meet the terms of his \nrepayment plan. Three days later Applicant and his wife filed their most recent Chapter \n13 petition for bankruptcy. They developed a repayment plan with their creditors, which \nthey paid for a period of time. They eventually stopped making regular monthly \npayments and the court dismissed their case for noncompliance with the plan terms on \nJuly 19, 2006.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt problems continue to exist. For a number of years, Applicant \nclaimed a high number of exemptions on his W-2, which he no longer does. When he \ncompleted his tax returns, he owed the state or federal government money, which he \ndid not have.  Some years he did not timely file his tax returns . In May 2002, the State \nfiled two tax liens against him for $1,070 and $2,395 respectively. In October 2003, the \nState filed two tax liens against him for $2,074 and $777 respectively. The state filed \nadditional tax liens against Applicant, totaling $13,862 in August 2006 and twice in \nOctober 2006. Applicant testified that he developed a repayment plan with the State. \nUnder the terms of this plan, he pays the State $100 a month and the State takes any \nrefund he receives for a tax year and applies the amount to his unpaid taxes. He has \nnot provided any documentation which supports his testimony, thus, I find that he has \nnot established his compliance with this payment plan or that he has satisfied any of his \nstate tax debts.6 \n \n3GE 12 (Bankruptcy court case summary for 1997 filing); GE 13 (Bankruptcy court case for 1995 \nfiling); Tr. 22-26. \n \n4GE 10 (Bankruptcy court case summary for 2001 filing); GE 11 (Bankruptcy court case summary \nfor 2000 filing); Tr. 27. \n \n5GE 7 (Bankruptcy court case summary for 2005 filing); GE  8 (Bankruptcy court case summary \nfor 2004 filing); GE 9 (Bankruptcy court case summary for 2004 filing); Tr. 28-30, 86-87. \n \n6GE 2 (Credit Report, dated April 29, 2008; GE  3 (Credit report, dated December 20, 2007); GE \n14 (Copy of tax lien filing October 2003); GE 15 (Copy of tax lien filing August 2006); GE 17 (Copy of tax \nlien filing October 2006); GE 17 (Copy of tax lien filing October 2006); Tr. 31-32, 76-78, 81-82. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \n \nOn November 20, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien \nagainst Applicant in the amount of $31,213. He testified that he reached an agreement \nwith the IRS to repay his tax debt in 2006. He agreed to pay the IRS $200 a month and \nthat the IRS would retain any refunds he would receive in a tax year. He did not provide \nany documentation on this agreement or information which shows his compliance with \nthe terms of the agreement. I find that he has not established his compliance with his \nfederal tax payment plan.7 \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the remaining debts listed in the SOR and amended SOR \nin his responses.  At the hearing, he acknowledged that these debts are not paid, \nexcept for the allegation in \u00b6 1.z., which he stated was paid. He provided no supporting \ndocumentation to show that this debt is paid. Thus, I find that he has not established \nthat he paid this debt. He denied knowing the medical provider in allegation \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and \n1.r. The credit reports indicated that he challenged the debt in \u00b61.r. He also denied \nknowing the creditors who obtained a judgment against him in the allegations contained \nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1. f and 1.g, despite admitting that he owed these debts. He also \nacknowledged that he had not attempted to determine the creditor through court \nrecords.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is currently on short-term disability as she suffers from severe \ndepression. She has applied for long-term disability, but has not yet been approved. Her \nmedical insurance expired in April 2008. Applicant has medical insurance for himself as \nhis employer pays the premiums. His wife and children do not have insurance because \nhe cannot afford to pay the premiums. His wife\u2019s medicines cost $200 a month and her \nmedical treatment totals $80 a month.9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $2,200 and his wife\u2019s short-term disability \nincome is $1,900 a month for a total monthly income of $4,100. His monthly expenses, \nincluding her medical bills and his tax payments, total $3,617. He and his wife have \ndeveloped a budget and try to live within their budget. Applicant admits that his financial \nproblems have been the result of money mismanagement and irresponsibility.10 \n \n \nThe government mailed interrogatories to Applicant in May 2007. Question two \nStates: \u201cPlease provide a Bankruptcy Trustee Report or other documentation from the \nBankruptcy Trustee reflecting your Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments are current.\u201d In his \nresponse to the interrogatory, applicant stated that his bankruptcy had been discharged \nand that currently all money owed due to bankruptcy is being paid, including all state \nand federal taxes owed. The government contends that his answer was not truthful \n \n \n7GE 16 (Copy of IRS tax lien filing November 2006); Tr. 33-34, 76-78, 80, 81, 83. \n \n8Response to SOR and amendment to SOR; Tr. 37-42, 49-62. \n \n9Tr. 43-44, 63-67. \n \n10Tr. 26, 43-47, 65-68. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nbecause his most recent bankruptcy had been dismissed because he failed to comply \nwith monthly payments. Applicant agreed, but denies any intent to deceive the \ngovernment because he did not know the difference between dismissed, discharged \nand terminated. He thought he gave the correct answer. He states he now knows the \ndifference. The allegation does not allege intentional falsification, only that he had not \nbeen truthful in his answer.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n \n11GE  6 (Interrogatories and answers, dated May 21, 2007); Tr. 48, 90-91. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG & \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. Despite having his debts discharged in 1999 and 2001, he continues to have \nsignificant unpaid debts. \n \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and concluded that none apply in \nthis case. Applicant has disputed one medical debt for $524 and this allegation is found \nin his favor. Although he testified that he has a repayment plan for his federal and state \ntaxes, he has not provided documentation to show that he has made the required \npayments and is in compliance with the plan. Given his long history of unpaid debts, I \ncan not find that he has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his tax liens without \nadequate documentation of his payments. He acknowledges his other debts are unpaid. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n \nThe government established that Applicant incorrectly provided information \nregarding his 2007 bankruptcy when answering the interrogatories propounded to him. \nThis information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a \nsecurity clearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s incorrect \nanswer must be deliberate. In his response, he agreed that the information provided \nwas incorrect. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these \nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is \ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the \ntime the omission occurred.1 For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish \nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate. \n \nApplicant had no intent to deceive. His carelessness about learning the \ndifference among the various legal terms employed in bankruptcy cases is not enough \nto show intentional falsification. His lack of understanding about these differences does \nnot show he lied; only that he misused the terminology. Government has not \nestablished its case of intentional falsification. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case \nNo. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline  J \n \n \nSince I found Guideline E in Applicant\u2019s favor, I find in favor of Applicant on this \nGuideline. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. For many years, Applicant and his \nwife have made very poor decisions about money. As a result, they have filed numerous \nbankruptcy petitions. Twice their debts have been discharged. They, however, did not \nchange spending habits. They continued to get into serious debt by over spending their \nincome and making poor financial choices. With his lump sum payment from his work \nrelated disability, Applicant paid debts, but could not or did not resolve all his debts. In \nfact, he accumulated more unpaid debt. He has done little to resolve his debt issues \nand given his past history, it is unlikely he will do so in the future. He has not \ndemonstrated that he has control over his spending habits and his finances. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r-1.aa: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nMARY E. HENRY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 21, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 13, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 14, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on January 8, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 17, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\n\n2\nkeep the record open until January 22, 2008, to submit additional matters.  She timely\nsubmitted a cover letter, three letters and a copy of checks, which have been marked\ncollectively as Exhibit F, and entered into evidence without objection. The record closed\non January 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some\nexplanations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old. She is not married and she has two children. \nApplicant is employed as an administrative secretary by a defense contractor,\nand she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the\ndefense sector.\nThe SOR lists 9 allegations (1.a. through 1.k.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,861.\nApplicant testified she and her sister recently sold the home that they had inherited from\ntheir mother, discussed in 1.h., below. On December 19, 2007, the escrow closed on\nthis home, and a payment will be made of $975 from the escrow proceeds to pay this\ndebt in full.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $300.\nApplicant testified that she had not yet made a payment of settlement on this debt, but\nwas planning to shortly.  She testified that her state tax return had been audited in 2005.\nExhibit B is a letter from the state tax board to Applicant\u2019s employer, dated July 30,\n2007,  which indicated that Applicant owed $3,203.98. The result is that Applicant\u2019s\nincome has been garnished in the amount of $150 a week, and she believed that the\nlast garnishment was scheduled to occur on January 17, 2008. Applicant testified that\nshe is not aware of any other garnishments set to be placed on her salary. After her last\npayment, she will have an additional $600 of disposable income each month, and will be\nable to pay off this debt with this additional money and her proceeds from the sale of the\nhome. I find that this debt is still outstanding, but it will be resolved shortly.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $169. As\ndiscussed in 1.b., above because of her additional income and the proceeds from the\nsale of her home, Applicant will be able and plans to pay off this debt shortly. I find that\nthis debt is still outstanding, but it will be resolved shortly. \n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $256. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that she plans to pay off this debt shortly, because of her\nadditional income and assets. I find that this debt is still outstanding, but it will be\nresolved shortly. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $485.\nApplicant explained that this debt and the two debts listed directly below as 1.f. and 1.g.\nare to the same company for credit card debts. In Exhibit F, Applicant indicates that the\ncreditor will settle this account for $204, and she will start making payments shortly.\n1.f. This second overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$504.  In Exhibit F, Applicant indicates that the creditor will eliminate this debt if she\nresolves the other two.\n1.g. This third overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,220.  In Exhibit F, Applicant avers that the creditor will settle this account for $610,\nand she will start making payments shortly.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 for a past due mortgage is cited in the SOR\nin the amount of $120,000. As discussed in 1.a., above, Applicant has sold the house\nupon which this mortgage is based.  Exhibit C shows that the property was sold as of\nDecember 19, 2007, for $470,118.07. It further shows that Applicant was scheduled to\nreceive $21,715.94 for the sale. However,  she testified it was her belief that because of\nadditional creditors that were going to be paid, Applicant would ultimately receive a\nsettlement of approximately $9,000. \n I find that this debt for an overdue mortgage has been resolved with the sale of\nthe house.  \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,887.\nApplicant submitted a post hearing letter from this creditor, dated January 21, 2008,\n(Exhibit F) in which a representative confirms that an agreement has been made\nwherein Applicant will resolve the debt for the full amount owed, by paying $50 on the\nfirst and the fifteenth of each month until the debt is paid in full. \n1.J. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $229.\nApplicant testified that she was never aware of the address of this creditor, which was a\ncompany that came to the location of her previous employer, and from which she\npurchased jewelry.  She is still trying to ascertain how to contact this vendor, and if and\nwhen she does, she testified that she will pay this debt.\n1.k. Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court on January 16,\n2003, for a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, in which she claimed liabilities of $144,868.04, and\nassets of $217,405. Applicant testified that the bankruptcy was dismissed, and the\ndebts were never discharged in the bankruptcy, because she did not want to include her\nhouse in the bankruptcy proceedings. \n\n4\nApplicant testified that her financial difficulties primarily began five years ago\nwhen her mother died and she inherited the home. The deed to this home had been lost\nthrough mortgage loan fraud to a fraudulent attorney for a period from approximately\n2002 until 2007, when she was able to regain title. The home payments and the\nattorney fees involved in trying to gain title back to the house caused most of her\nfinancial problems and overdue debts. In addition she was unemployed for a period of\napproximately four months in late 2005.\nApplicant testified that she is not overdue on any of her current debts. She owns\none credit card that is not overdue\nApplicant submitted a letter from an individual who identified himself as the\npresident of a wealth management group (Exhibit D), and who indicated that he has\nbeen working closely with Applicant to try to help her recover the deed to her home. He\nalso indicated that she has spent a great deal of time and effort trying to restore her\ncredit rating.\nFinally, Applicant offered into evidence a letter from a woman who has known\nApplicant for 45 years (Exhibit F). She spoke in extremely laudatory terms, describing\nher as \u201ctrustworthy and a woman of impeccable character.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n5\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from the fraudulent loss of the ownership of\nApplicant\u2019s home and financial requirements necessary for the recovery in addition to\nApplicant\u2019s four month loss of employment. Applicant has acted responsibly by selling\nher home once she regained title to the home, and ultimately using the proceeds to help\npay off her debts. l find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in\nthis case. \n Applicant is now more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude that she has mitigated the financial concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Condition (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence\nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 17, 2005. On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant  detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline M and Guideline E as the bases for its decision to deny his\nrequest for a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 16, 2007, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On February 27, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of nine exhibits (Items 1-9). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nApplicant submitted no response by the April 6, 2008, deadline. On May 27, 2008, the\nJune 23, 2008\n\n2\ncase was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of\nthe government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4),\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline M, use of information technology systems, and\nGuideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant was terminated by a former employer in\nJanuary 2005 for using his government-provided computer and Internet access to view\nsexually explicit prohibited web sites in violation of government policies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 2.a). Applicant admitted that while employed as a systems administrator, he surfed\nthe Internet, and viewed pornographic web sites. He apologized for his \u201cterrible mistake\u201d\nand averred it would not be repeated (Item 4). After reviewing the available evidence, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old designer who has been employed by a division of a\nlarge defense contractor since March 2005. He had worked for the company as an\nengineering analyst from July 1982 to June 2000 before it was acquired by its present\ncorporate parent. During his previous tenure, Applicant had collateral duties as the\nsecurity representative for his section (Item 4, Item 5). His present position occasionally\nrequires access to areas where a security clearance is required (Item 4).\nApplicant was married to his first wife from June 1980 to April 1991. They had\ntwin daughters born in June 1981. He was on active duty in the U.S. military from July\n1978 to July 1982 and held a top secret-level clearance. After his four-year enlistment\nended, he began working for his present employer as an engineering analyst. He\nproduced and updated drawings that were classified in nature (Item 4, Item 5).\nIn late June 1991, Applicant married his current spouse and became a stepfather\nto two children aged 14 and 11. In June 2000, he left his defense contractor position for\nthe information technology sector. He worked for a succession of companies gaining\nexperience and responsibility (Item 4, Item 5).\nFrom September 2001 to January 2005, he was employed as a contract\ncomputer systems administrator on a government installation. Applicant was\nresponsible for administering a computer network connected to other federal\ninstallations and he had daily access to a secure government computer. He also had a\nsecond government computer with electronic mail and Internet access capability that he\nused daily in the performance of his non-classified work. On October 3, 2002, Applicant\nsigned an Automated Information Systems User Acknowledgment Form authorizing his\nuse of a government-owned computer solely for business purposes (Item 4, Item 6, Item\n7). \nSecure transmissions took 30 minutes or more to complete and Applicant found\nhimself with substantial \u201cdown time\u201d on the job. In about early 2004, Applicant began to\n\n3\nsurf the Internet using his non-secure computer while awaiting secure transmissions. He\naccessed several different types of non-business related web sites, including sport,\ngovernment and politics, finance and investment, news, photo searches, arts and\nentertainment, education, personals and dating, travel, and even hate speech. At times,\nhe spent up to three hours in a given workday accessing the Internet for personal\npurposes. Applicant considered the secure computer network to be his prime\nresponsibility, and as long as it was being monitored and running smoothly, he was\ndoing his job (Item 6, Item 7).\nBetween October 5, 2004, and December 23, 2004, Applicant spent about 7.95\ntotal hours accessing over 500 sexually explicit prohibited web addresses on his\ngovernment work computer (Item 7). Applicant was aware access to pornography was\nprohibited by government policy and in violation of the Automated Information Systems\nAcknowledgment Form he had executed in October 2002, but he thought it was no big\ndeal since his work was being done (Item 6). On January 12, 2005, the government\ncontracting officer directed Applicant\u2019s employer to remove him from his position on the\nfederal installation and terminate his services under the contract immediately because\nof his unauthorized Internet access to sexually explicit prohibited web addresses, in\nviolation of the service\u2019s core values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty, the policies\nand guidelines involving personal use of government office equipment, and the\nagreement Applicant had signed limiting his access to business purposes (Item 7).\nWhen confronted by his employer, Applicant admitted his mistake. He was terminated\nfrom his job for cause (Item 6).\nApplicant was out of work for a few months until March 2005, when he was hired\nby his present employer. Needing a security clearance for his work as a designer,\nApplicant completed an e-QIP on August 17, 2005. He responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 22,\nconcerning whether he had been fired from, quit, or left a job within the past seven\nyears under adverse circumstances, and indicated that in January 2005, he had \u201cLeft a\njob for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. Internet Misuse.\u201d (Item 5).\nOn October 5, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense about his separation from his previous employment. Applicant\nindicated he had used his non-secure computer solely for business until the last nine to\ntwelve months of his employment when he began to surf the Internet during down time\nin his job. Applicant explained his initial access to pornography using his work computer\nwas unintended (he entered an \u201cinnocent search word\u201d into the Google search engine\nand a porn site popped up) but he found them interesting and began looking at some of\nthem out of curiosity. Applicant admitted he knew he should not have been surfing the\nInternet, particularly adult web sites. He did not consider it a big deal since his work was\nbeing done. When he was called in by the company\u2019s president, Applicant thought he\nwas going to be warned or reprimanded but he was fired. Applicant admitted he was not\nallowed to collect unemployment even though he also claimed the president indicated\nhe would tell anyone who called that he had been laid off. Applicant denied he had a big\ninterest in pornography and indicated to the investigator he had made a \u201cstupid\n\n4\ndecision\u201d to access the adult sites and had learned his lesson. Applicant averred that\nhis spouse and his boss know about the details of the job termination (Item 6).\nAs of May 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse was also working as a designer for the\ndefense contractor that employs Applicant (Item 6). Applicant denies he could be\nsubjected to blackmail or coercion. To his understanding, he was fired for \u201cexcessive\nunauthorized internet abuse.\u201d In Answer to the SOR, Applicant expressed his remorse\nand vowed to not repeat it (\u201cI admit that I made a terrible mistake and apologize for it\nand will not repeat it in the future.\u201d) (Item 4).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\n5\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline M\u2014Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern for use of information technology systems is set out in \u00b6 39:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nThe government and his employer relied on him as systems administrator to\ncomply with the policies and procedures concerning use of the information technology\nsystem. Applicant violated government policies as well as an agreement he signed in\nOctober 2002 concerning authorized use of a government-owned information resource\nasset when he improperly and repeatedly surfed the Internet for personal use during\nwork hours in 2004. In addition to viewing news, sports, entertainment, and travel sites,\nhe accessed over 500 sexually explicit prohibited web addresses using his government\nwork computer between October 5, 2004, and December 23, 2004, if not before. He\nknew his use of the non-secure government computer was for business purposes only\nand he had agreed in writing to abide by this restriction. He also knew access to\nsexually explicit web sites was prohibited. AG \u00b6 40(e) (\u201cunauthorized use of a\ngovernment or other information technology system\u201d) applies.\nThere is no evidence of any misuse of a work computer by Applicant since he\nstarted with his present employer in March 2005. While the passage of time is a\nmitigating condition (see AG \u00b6 41(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior\nhappened, or it happened under unusual circumstances, such that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d)), his knowing disregard of policies prohibiting unauthorized use continues to\ncast doubt about his personal judgment. He has not shown any efforts to address the\nissues raised by his repeated access to prohibited adult sites at work. When interviewed\nin October 2006, he claimed pornography was not a big interest of his, but his access to\n\n6\nover 500 sexually explicit prohibited web addresses on his work computer suggests a\nproblem Applicant is unwilling to acknowledge or deal with. He rationalized his behavior\nin his mind as long as the work was getting the work done. He has since apologized for\nhis \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d but missing from his apology (\u201cThe loss of my job, embarrassment\nto myself and family, and subsequent three month period of unemployment taught me a\nstern lesson.\u201d Item 4), is any meaningful appreciation for the extent to which he violated\nhis fiduciary obligations. None of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 apply. His\nInternet surfing, to include of prohibited adult sites, cannot reasonably be characterized\nas minor and it was not done in the interest of organizational efficiency (see AG \u00b6\n41(b)). AG \u00b6 41(c) applies only to unintentional or inadvertent conduct. \nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s knowing misuse of a government information resource system and\ncomputer for nine months to a year in 2004 also raises security significant personal\nconduct concerns of the type contemplated in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) (\u201ca pattern of dishonesty\nor rule violations\u201d) and 16(d)(4) (\u201cevidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources\u201d). Yet, since his misuse of the computer is explicitly\ncovered under AG \u00b6 39 of Guideline M, supra, it does not fall squarely within the\nconcerns addressed in AG \u00b6 16(d), which applies on its face to \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination. . . .\u201d The overall security concern under\nAG \u00b6 15 is clearly implicated, however.\nPersonal conduct concerns may also be raised where there is evidence of\n\u201cconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(e)).\nUnauthorized use of a computer involving access to pornography at work is information\nthat clearly could negatively affect his standing with his family and colleagues.\nApplicant maintains he is not vulnerable to coercion, calling attention to the following\nlanguage in the investigator\u2019s report (Item 6): \u201cThe investigation report of 11/1/06 stated\n\u2018He has learned his lesson. His wife and boss know about the details of the termination.\nThis information could not be used for blackmail or coercion.\u2019\u201d When read in context, the\ninvestigator was not stating her own conclusions as to Applicant\u2019s potential vulnerability\nbut rather merely reporting what Applicant told her. The available record, which includes\nthe report of his interview, sheds no light on what Applicant told his spouse or his boss.\n\n7\nHis uncorroborated generalization that his spouse and supervisor know of the details of\nhis employment termination is insufficient to mitigate the vulnerability concerns under\nAG \u00b6 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d).\nApplicant\u2019s violations of the government\u2019s policies concerning authorized use of\nits information systems resources are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). Again, despite the\npassage of time, it continues to raise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and\njudgment. His acknowledgment of the behavior satisfies only the first prong of AG \u00b6\n17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d). He spent a considerable amount of\nwork time in unsanctioned activity and has presented little to overcome the concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for classified access by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to\nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole person concept, applying\nthe conclusions set forth previously in this analysis. Applicant indicates he learned a\n\u201cstern lesson\u201d from his mistake, and he acknowledged his unauthorized Internet access\nwhen he was interviewed by a government investigator and when he answered the\nSOR. Security clearance decisions are not intended to punish for past misconduct, but\nApplicant presented little to show that he can be counted on to abide by the ethical and\nfiduciary obligations of a security clearance.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Her third divorce led to\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately nine delinquent debts. Applicant  demonstrated she\nis financially responsible by paying or settling six debts. One debt is disputed, and her student loan\nis in abeyance. She is researching her debt on her home repossession.  Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines.  Clearance is\ngranted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant waived the notice.\n2\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated November 8, 2005).\n3\nTr.84.\n4\nTr.30.\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On April 16, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR on a unknown date, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for\nNovember 29, 2007.2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on November 29, 2007, via video teleconference,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Government exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A-\nJ) were admitted into the record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until December 5, 2007 for a document that was marked\nAE K. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 11, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from high school\nin 1989,and attended college from 1994 until 1996. Applicant has been with her current employer\nsince October 2003.  She is thrice divorced and has two children.3\nAfter high school Applicant worked at an army installation for several years. When her\ndaughter was born in 1991 she stopped working for several years. She again stopped working after\nher son was born in 1995. She has worked steadily since 1996 but prior to her current position she\nearned low hourly wages.4\nApplicant married her third husband in 1999, but this marriage ended in divorce in 2002. As\na result of that marriage, Applicant experienced financial difficulties. Her husband did not produce\na steady income. He also had bad credit and thus Applicant had to use her credit for all family\npurchases. The family\u2019s mobile home was repossessed in 2002.   After her divorce in 2002,\n5\n\nTr. 31.\n6\nTr. 58.\n7\nAE K (Credit Report, dated November 28, 2007).\n8\nAE F (Letter from District Attorney\u2019s office, dated June 26, 2007). \n9\n3\nApplicant lived on approximately $330 net per week. She had difficulty meeting daily expenses for\nher family and paying all her bills.\nIn 2003 Applicant became very ill. She could not move out of bed and was taken to the\nhospital. She was diagnosed with an inflamed pelvis and transferred to another hospital for surgery.\nShe had health insurance and the company paid the hospital. However, Applicant later learned that\nshe was mis-diagnosed and had a herniated disc. The insurance company later determined that the\nhospital should not have been paid due to conflicting medical information. Applicant was then billed\nby the hospital for all medical charges incurred in the amount of $7,042.   \n6\nApplicant has a student loan which she paid on for a number of years. She could not keep up\nwith the payments after her divorce. At one point it was in default, but now payments are deferred.7\nHer credit report confirms this status.  Applicant intends to complete her undergraduate degree to\n8\nmaximize her job opportunities.\nIn 2006, Applicant asked her boyfriend to deposit a check for her into her bank account so\nthat she could pay a bill. He did not do so for a number of days. Applicant\u2019s check for $85 was\ndeemed insufficient funds (NSF) by the bank. A bench warrant was issued for her because of this\nmatter. This was quickly resolved. Applicant paid all fees associated with the NSF. There is no\nwarrant for her arrest.9\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s debts are as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCollection account                 $59\nPaid\nAE A\n1.b\nCharged off account              $1,462\nSettled\nAE B\n1.c\nStudent loan\n          $25,148\nDeferred\nAE K; GE 2\n1.d\nHome repossession\n          $20,175\nPlan to resolve\nTr. 30\n1.e\nMedical collection                 $7,042\nDispute\nAE C; Tr.30-33\n1.f\nCollection account                  $300\nPaid\nAE D\n1.g\nCollection account                  $84\nPaid\nAE D\n1.h\nCollection account                  $58\nPaid\nAE E\n1.i\nCollection account                  $29\nPaid\nAE I\n\nTr. 37.\n10\nAE I (Letter from Business Manager, dated August 14, 2007).\n11\nAE J (Letter from Supervisor, Central Support, undated).\n12\nAE G (Letter from Sheriff, dated November 28, 2007).\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n14\n4\nApplicant has paid or settled 6 of 9 debts in the SOR. However, two large bills remain\nunpaid. The student loan is in deferment and Applicant will start payments again when the deferment\nexpires. As to the home repossession, Applicant has called numerous times to locate the current\nholder of the collection account. She has spoken to an associate to settle the matter. At first, she was\ntold they could not locate any record or any amount in Applicant\u2019s name. Although Applicant was\nadvised that their legal department would research the matter and contact her, she has yet to be\nadvised of any result. Applicant stands ready to resolve the matter. Applicant emphasized that she\nmade the choice to have the mobile home repossessed rather than file bankruptcy.  She is unsure of\nthe amount of the debt because she has not been informed of the amount received at the auction. She\nis actively attempting to settle this matter. Applicant disputed the hospital and medical bill ($7,062)\nbecause insurance should have covered the bills. She is now trying to resolve the bill and pay the\namount owed to the hospital.10\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $2,525. After expenses and debt repayment, she\nhas a net monthly remainder of $200. She is current on her car loan and other bills at this time.\nApplicant\u2019s project manager highly endorses her and recommends her for a security\nclearance. She is described as a solid citizen, and an outstanding worker who manifests the right\nattitude toward security related matters. She has been employed with the company for more than four\nyears and has received promotions. She is described as an outstanding employee and a valued asset.11\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has known her for twelve years as a friend. She is trustworthy and\nloyal in all respects. He attests that she can be trusted not to discuss confidential matters and handles\npersonnel records and training documents as one of her responsibilities.12\nThe sheriff in Applicant\u2019s home county has known Applicant for a number of years. He\nattests to her professional, knowledgeable, hardworking attitude. He finds her trustworthy and\nhonest.13\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n14\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\n\nId. at 527.\n15\nExec.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n17\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n18\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n19\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n20\nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts establishes Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations). Her admissions and credit reports confirm the delinquent debts.\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n21\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\n6\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors in resolving her debts show she is now\nreliable, trustworthy and has good judgment. Applicant divorced her third husband in 2002. He had\nbad credit and during the marriage, Applicant used her credit and was responsible for many of the\nbills. Her divorce and then her illness in 2003 exacerbated the financial conditions. She is now\nearning a steady income with her current employer. She extricated herself from her marriage. She\nchose not to file bankruptcy but to pay her creditors as much as she was able. I find that FC MC\n20(b) is applicable. FC MC 20(c) is also applicable for the reasons stated above. Even though,\nApplicant did not receive counseling, she is resolving her financial problems. Finally, Applicant paid\n6 of 9 bills in the SOR and her student loan is in deferred status. She is actively trying to settle the\naccount for the home repossession.  \n21\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\n\nAG \u00b6 15\n22\n7\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.22\nThe adverse information concerning the bench warrant for the faulty check is resolved.\nCounsel did not dispute this at the hearing. Applicant explained the situation concerning the faulty\ndeposit which resulted in the check for NSF. She produced documentation that the issue has been\nresolved since June 2007. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant had a history of good credit and no financial problems until her third marriage. She\nhas earned praise and promotions with her current employer. She is described as trustworthy and is\nendorsed for a security clearance. She paid or settled six of the nine SOR debts. One debt is in\nabeyance, one debt is disputed, and one debt is being researched. She weathered her 2000 divorce\nand supported her family while earning a low wage for a period of time. Her illness created the\nmedical bills. She has not ignored  them. She lives within her means. She was forthright and candid\nat the hearing. She produced documentation and a credible account of her efforts to resolve all her\nfinancial difficulties.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues, and personal conduct. She is eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:-1.i:\n            For Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to Criminal Conduct in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g. through 1.k., and 1.m. through 1.w.). He denied the remaining allegations, as well as all of the factual allegations pertaining to Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct.

Patterson, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding criminal conduct, \nalcohol consumption, and personal conduct.  Eligibility for a security clearance and \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 5, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nSecurity Clearance Application (SF 86). On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct), G (Alcohol Consumption), and E (Personal Conduct), \nand detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nMay 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 18, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated September 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch on December 5, 2008. \nIt was reassigned to me on February 6, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A Notice \nof Hearing was issued on March 6, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on \nMarch 26, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, nine Government exhibits and four Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on April 3, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAt the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s case, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR to conform to the evidence presented.  Specifically, she moved to withdraw SOR & \n3.d. There being no objection, the motion was granted.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations \npertaining to Criminal Conduct in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g. through 1.k., and \n1.m. through 1.w.).  He denied the remaining allegations, as well as all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct.  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. He has been \ngainfully employed by the same defense contractor since January 2005, and currently \nserves as a modular radio systems engineer.2 His employment history since 1997 \nincludes a variety of positions with different employers, both as an employee and as \neither an intern or a member of a student Co-op.

Just living for the day versus following my \ndreams and just mapping a course to complete the degree that I had \nchosen in electronics engineering. \n \nIn discussing his feeling toward authority during that period, he stated:11 \n \nIt was perhaps a cavalier attitude. Not one of contempt but not holding it in \nI guess, utmost respect and or even the proper fear thereof. \n \nCriminal Conduct & Alcohol Consumption  \n \nApplicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice have been \nalcohol and cocaine. Over the years, from about 1980 until about 2005, Applicant was \ninvolved in numerous incidents with law enforcement authorities. Some of those \nincidents involved alcohol or cocaine, and others did not. Likewise, in some of those \nincidents, Applicant correctly identified himself to the authorities, and in some others, he \nused various aliases. His Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record \nindicates his use of 23 variations of his name or other false identities, 10 different social \nsecurity numbers, and 6 different dates of birth.12 The SOR alleges 23 incidents, but \nthere are other non-alleged incidents as well: \n \n3 Tr. at 30. \n \n4 Applicant Exhibit B, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n5 Id. at 2. \n \n6 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86, dated April 5, 2005), at 10. \n \n7 Id. at 9. \n \n8 Tr. at 56. \n \n9 Id. at 57. \n \n10 Id. at 30-31. \n \n11 Id. at 31. \n \n12 Government Exhibit 2 (FBI Identification Record, dated July 8, 2008), at 1-2. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nSOR & 1.w.: On December 2, 1980, when he was 23 years old, Applicant was \narrested for driving off in someone else\u2019s vehicle, without permission, and charged with \none count of grand larceny and two counts of petit larceny.13 He was convicted of petit \nlarceny and sentenced to 30 days in the county jail.14 He was released after a few \nweeks.15 \n \nSOR & 1.v.: On January 27, 1981, Applicant was arrested for urinating in an alley \nand charged with one count of indecent exposure.16 He does not recall if he had been \ndrinking before the incident.17 Applicant denies he was ever convicted of the charge,18 \nand there is no evidence to refute his contention. \n \nSOR & 1.u.: On December 18, 1981, Applicant was arrested for stealing \nsomething, not otherwise identified, and charged with one count of theft.19 Applicant \ndoes not recall if he was ever convicted of the charge,20 and there is no evidence to \nindicate that he was. \n \nSOR & 1.t.: On March 20, 1982, Applicant was arrested for stealing an \nautomobile, and charged with one count of auto theft.21  He does not recall if he was \never convicted of the charge,22 and there is no evidence to indicate that he was. \n \nSOR & 1.s.: On September 8, 1982, Applicant was arrested and charged with \none count of trespass, and one count of destroying property.23 Applicant does not recall \nif he was ever convicted of the charge,24 and there is no evidence to indicate that he \nwas. \n \n \n13 Government Exhibit 5 (FBI Identification Record, dated March 16, 1999), at 2. \n \n14 Tr. at 58-59. \n \n15 Id. at 59. \n \n16 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 13, at 2. \n \n17 Tr. at 60. \n \n18 Id. \n \n19 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 13, at 2. \n \n20 Tr. at 60-61. \n \n21 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 13, at 2. \n \n22 Tr. at 61. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 13, at 2. \n \n24 Tr. at 62. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nNot alleged in the SOR: On June 25, 1983, Applicant was not arrested but was \ncharged with one count of driving under the influence (DUI) and one count of \nspeeding.25 He was convicted of the charges and sentenced to a fine and three years \nprobation.26 \n \nSOR & 1.r.: On January 18, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nrobbery.27  He admitted the incident but disputed the characterization, claiming it was \nmerely \u201can exaggeration of personal fisticuffs,\u201d and not robbery.28 There is no evidence \nto indicate he was ever convicted of the charge. \n \nSOR & 1.q.: On January 21, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ngrand theft auto.29 On February 11, 1986, the charge was dismissed nolle prosequi. 30 \n \nSOR & 1.p.: On March 10, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nassault with a deadly weapon - pipe.31  He admitted the incident but disputed the \ncharacterization, claiming it was \u201canother incident of fisticuffs\u201d following a rock concert, \nand not assault with a deadly weapon.32 On May 20, 1986, the charge was dismissed.33 \n \nSOR & 1.o.: On March 26, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndestruction of property.34  On August 13, 1986, the charge was dismissed.35 \n \nSOR & 1.n.: On November 18, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ntheft.36 He was subsequently convicted of the charge and sentenced to a fine and to be \nconfined in the county jail for an unspecified period.37 \n \n \n25 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 12, at 4. \n \n26 Id.;

Additionally, since 2005, there is no evidence to indicate that he has attempted to \ndrive an automobile while legally impaired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with cocaine was much more limited.  He contends he \npurchased it on two occasions for his own use in 1992, and used it on three or four \noccasions that same year.86 He claims he last used cocaine in 1992,87 and there is no \nevidence to rebut his claim. \n \nApplicant has never undergone alcohol treatment or counseling,88 nor has he \never been evaluated or diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.89 On \nMarch 13, 2007, he successfully completed 54 hours of alcohol education and \ncounseling after being referred to the program by the court.90  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nOn February 8, 1999, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \ncompleted Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP).91 The SOR alleges \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose two aspects of his police record in Section 23 \nthereof. The SOR & 3.a. refers to question 23.d. (Have you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?).

He was convicted of the charge \nand sentenced to 18 months confinement. He was also arrested on April 19, 1993 (SOR \n& 1.h.), and charged with one count of failure to appear \u2013 felony, and three counts of \nforgery \u2013 felonies. The purported September 1996 incident actually occurred in August \n1995 (SOR & 1.e.). He was convicted of one possession of a forged instrument and the \namended charge of solicitation, and sentenced to prison for 1-5 years, concurrent with \nother charges as set forth in SOR & 1.i. The May 1991 incident is set forth in SOR & \n1.k. Applicant certified that his responses were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best \nof his knowledge and belief.96 They were not, for he omitted his July 11, 1998 arrest \n(SOR & 1.d.) for menacing threats and resisting arrest, his May 4, 1994 arrest (SOR & \n1.f.) for DUI, his August 26, 1993 arrest (SOR & 1.g.) for criminal damage and trespass \n\u2013 felony, as well as his June 25, 1983 arrest (not alleged in the SOR) for DUI, for which \nhe was sentenced to a fine and three years probation. \n \nApplicant attributes his failure to list every incident required by the questions to a \nvariety of possibilities which he failed to fully explore or explain. In his answer to SOR \nhe raised the possibilities that: (1) he genuinely forgot the arrest, (2) he inadvertently \noverlooked it, (3) he misunderstood the question, (4) he thought the arrest had been \nrelated to a prior charge and did not need to be reported, and (5) in his haste to submit \nthe application he reported all of the more serious incidents.97 Furthermore, it was his \nimpression that felonies were the most important issue and he \u201cdid not carry over the \nsame degree of completeness or thoroughness to [the question dealing with offenses \ndealing with alcohol or drugs].\u201d98 Despite denying a deliberate falsification, he admitted \ndeliberately omitting any alcohol or drug incidents in the 1980s because he was \npurportedly under the impression that there was a seven-year time-frame for such \noffenses.99 He intentionally omitted the other arrests of interest either because they \nwere based on bench warrants for earlier incidents or they still remained unresolved.100  \n \n \n \n94 Id. at 11. \n \n95 Id. \n \n96 Id. at 11. \n \n97 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, supra note 43, at 7-8. \n \n98 Tr. at 112. \n \n99 Id. at 111. \n \n100 Id. at 112-115; Government Exhibit 3, supra note 73, at 4. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nOn April 5, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \ncompleted SF 86.101 The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose one \naspect of his police record in Section 24 thereof. The SOR & 3.c. refers to question 24: \n(Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or \ndrugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case \nhas been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for \nwhich the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or \n18 U.S.C. 3607.). There is no express limitation to that particular question which would \ndecrease the reportable period to anything less than \u201cever.\u201d102 Applicant answered \n\u201cYes\u201d to the question and listed two such incidents: an August 1992 possession of \ncocaine conviction and a May 1991 DUI conviction.103 Applicant certified that his \nresponses were \u201dtrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief.104 \nThey were not, for he omitted his March 31, 2001 arrest (SOR & 1.c.) for two counts of \nfalse report to law enforcement, and DUI - liquor/drugs/vapors/combo, and his May 4, \n1994 arrest (SOR & 1.f.) for DUI. Once again, Applicant attributes his failure to list every \nincident required by the question to the same variety of possibilities set forth above \nwhich he failed to fully explore or explain. \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony during the hearing was replete with \u201cI do not recall\u201d \nresponses to inquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the dispositions of \nthose arrests, and whether or not he had consumed alcohol prior to the individual \nincidents.  Likewise, when questioned pertaining to a particular incident, he sometimes \nresponded by referring to other incidents.  He referred to incidents with the wrong dates. \nHe admitted stealing the identity of others.105 When asked what assurances he could \nprovide that he would not have future \u201cmomentary errors of judgment,\u201d he stated that his \nfirm conviction and the fact that he does not repeat prior mistakes would guide his future \nactions.106 \n \nAccording to a person who has known Applicant for 12 years, including their \nundergraduate years, Applicant is \u201cintelligent, capable, and ethical,\u201d as well as \u201creadily \ncapable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness, insight, and maturity, always \nusing sound judgment in his work and personal areas of responsibility.\u201d He is \nconsidered organized, efficient, and extremely competent.107 \n \n \n101 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 6. \n \n102 It should be noted, however, that questions 25 and 26 do limit the reportable period to the previous seven \nyears.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon \na finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d109   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d110 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to \nestablish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.111  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n111 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d112 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d113 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:       \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of criminal conduct, \ninvolving over 20 arrests and a substantial number of convictions (along with a number \nof dismissals), is documented in his police and court records, his answers to \ninterrogatories, and the evidence, including his testimony, presented during the hearing. \nThe Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \n \n112 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n113 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ In addition, when there is \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the \noffense,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c) may apply. Similarly, AG \u00b6 32(d) may apply when \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.@  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) only partially applies in one instance, but not for the remaining \nincidents, for several reasons. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, as set forth in the \nSOR, commenced in 1980, when he was 23 years old, and continued repeatedly over \nthe next 25 years with few significant breaks between incidents. Criminal conduct, \nsometimes only months apart from each other, occurred largely because of Applicant\u2019s \ncavalier attitude towards authority and regulations, including the law. His cursory \nexplanation and justification for his conduct that he had a cavalier lifestyle at the time \nprovides no mitigation. Moreover, Applicant apparently transformed himself from the old \nconstruction industry lifestyle to an engineering lifestyle in 1997, and five incidents \noccurred after that. Over an extensive period, arrests and judicial punishment failed to \nstem the tide of his criminal activities. Instead, emboldened by some relatively light fines \nand brief periods of confinement, as well as some dismissals of charges, he added \nidentity theft to his misconduct. \n \nThe circumstances of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct were not so unusual that it \nwould be unlikely to recur. To the contrary, the circumstances cast substantial doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. While I might be \npersuaded that one incident which was fully detailed and described during the hearing \nmight justify the application of AG \u00b6 32(a), Applicant\u2019s inability to explain or describe the \ncircumstances of other incidents indicates AG \u00b6 32(a) should not apply to the remaining \nincidents. \n \nApplicant has argued that sufficient time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \noccurred to support mitigation of such conduct. He contends the last incident occurred \nin October 2001, and that the September 2005 incident was merely a slip or relapse. \nConsidering the lengthy period of criminal conduct, the three and one-half years since \nhis last SOR-alleged arrest, and the two years since he completed the alcohol \neducation and counseling program stemming from that conviction, I believe the time \nelapsed does not yet satisfy the intent of AG \u00b6 32(a).  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) partially applies. The SOR alleges a large number of arrests, and in \nsome instances, Applicant was convicted on one or more charges. In some instances, \nthere is no evidence of a court disposition, and in other instances, the evidence is that \nthe charges were dismissed. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s recollection pertaining to many of \nthose events was not significant. It is noted that the earlier version of the AG contained \nthe mitigating condition for \u201cacquittal,\u201d but that condition was changed to the current \ncondition: \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense.\u201d I recognize that \nacquittal on the basis of a technicality does not address the substance of the charge \nand should not be the sole basis for mitigation. The revised AG condition mitigates only \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \non the basis of evidence that the person did not commit the offense. In other words, it \nrequires an applicant to prove a negative. The burden of proof is different in the \ncourtroom than in the personnel security system herein. However, considering the \nquality of the evidence, while there is evidence of some arrests and some dismissals, \nthere is no evidence dispositive of Applicant\u2019s actual commission of the particular \noffenses in issue.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. Applicant argues that there is evidence of substantial \nrehabilitation because he has successfully completed the alcohol education and \ncounseling program, has not had any negative incidents during the past three and one-\nhalf years, and has a new lifestyle and respect for the law. There is insufficient evidence \nof successful rehabilitation despite Applicant\u2019s program completion and there being no \nfurther SOR-alleged criminal conduct. While a person should not be held forever \naccountable for misconduct from the past, without a clear indication of subsequent \nreform, remorse, or rehabilitation, I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty \nthe probability that such conduct will not recur in the future.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:  \n      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, \u201chabitual or binge consumption \nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d may apply under AG \u00b6 22(c).  \nAG \u00b6 22(a) is established by Applicant\u2019s DUI arrests and/or convictions; and AG \u00b6 22(c), \nbecause he habitually consumes alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in May 1991, May 1994, March \n2001, and September 2005. The evidence reflects convictions for all but the May 1994 \nincident.  As for Applicant\u2019s continued consumption of alcohol to the point of impairment, \nthe following evidence is significant. Applicant abstained for a few months following his \n2005 DUI, but resumed his consumption of beer with the same frequency, but with a \ndiminished quantity. He estimated it would take two or three beers to \u201cput him over the \nlegal limit,\u201d which is .08, and six or seven beers \u201cto make him intoxicated.\u201d He currently \nconsumes three or four 12 ounce beers during the course of a sporting event, on one or \ntwo occasions per month. He claims the last time he consumed alcohol to the point of \nintoxication was in 2005.  By his own admission, if two or three beers put him over the \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \nlegal limit, his current consumption of three or four beers, once or twice a month, while \nnot sufficient to make him intoxicated, clearly passes the point of impaired judgment. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from alcohol consumption under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d). But in this \ninstance, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Furthermore, after careful \nconsideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption, I conclude \nApplicant\u2019s continued alcohol consumption to the point of impairment after his DUI \nconviction, and after completion of the alcohol education and counseling program, \nindicate he is unwilling or unable to curtail his alcohol consumption. As such, his \nconduct demonstrates a lack of judgment and/or a failure to control impulses which is \ninconsistent with the holder of a security clearance. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 16(a), a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative,\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s omissions of critical \ninformation pertaining to arrests, provides sufficient evidence to examine if his \nomissions were deliberate falsifications or were the result of simple oversight or \nnegligence on his part.  \n \nAs noted above, Applicant attributes his failure to list every incident required by \nthe questions to a variety of possibilities which he failed to fully explore or explain. \nSome of those possibilities are inconsistent with each other, and, except for certain \ninstances, he never explicitly selected one particular one to justify his actions. His \u201cI do \nnot recall\u201d responses to inquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the \ndispositions of those arrests, and whether or not he had consumed alcohol prior to the \nindividual incidents, also are cause for concern. His responses to inquiries during the \nhearing were less than full and complete, and conveyed the impression that he was \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nunconcerned, unprepared to be candid, or deliberately evasive. He also admitted \nstealing the identity of others. \n \nWhen asked what assurances he could provide that he would not have future \n\u201cmomentary errors of judgment,\u201d he stated that his firm conviction and the fact that he \ndoes not repeat prior mistakes would guide his future actions. There is one problem \naccepting that explanation and that is that Applicant\u2019s history is one violation, one \narrest, one conviction, one falsification, and one omission after another. \n \nHis explanations are at odds with the characterization of him by his character \nwitness: Applicant is \u201creadily capable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness, \ninsight, and maturity, always using sound judgment in his work and personal areas of \nresponsibility.\u201d A person so characterized would not have overlooked the incidents or \nmisconstrued the questions. He is clearly very intelligent. I find Applicant\u2019s explanations \nare incredible in his denial of deliberate falsification.114 \n \nFurthermore, contrary to Applicant\u2019s contentions, and despite denying deliberate \nfalsifications, he admitted deliberately omitting certain incidents in the 1980s because \nhe was purportedly under the erroneous impression that there was a seven-year time-\nframe for such offenses, and he intentionally omitted other arrests of interest either \nbecause they were based on bench warrants for earlier incidents or they still remained \nunresolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) have been established. \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a)-(g). But in this instance, \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n \n114 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n\n \n19 \n                                      \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, G, and E in my analysis below.      \n \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s 25 year history of criminal conduct, as set forth in \nthe SOR, commenced in 1980, when he was 23 years old, and continued repeatedly \nover the years with few breaks between incidents. His criminal conduct, according to \nApplicant, occurred largely because of his cavalier attitude towards authority and \nregulations, including the law. Arrests and judicial punishment failed to stem the tide of \nhis criminal activities. Instead, he added identity theft to his conduct. He currently \nconsumes enough beer to cause him to pass the point of impaired judgment. \n \nHis testimony and explanations pertaining to both his criminal conduct and the \nalleged falsifications on his QNSP and SF 86 are at odds with the characterization of \nhim by his character witness: \u201creadily capable of handling any situation with \nthoughtfulness, insight, and maturity, always using sound judgment in his work and \npersonal areas of responsibility.\u201d A person \u2013 a member of Mensa \u2013 so characterized \nwould not have overlooked the incidents or misconstrued the questions. To the contrary, \nhis testimony, including his flawed memory and explanations, as well as his continued \nalcohol consumption, establishes irresponsibility, immaturity, a cavalier attitude towards \nthe law, and absence of rehabilitation and true remorse. Taken together, his conduct \nover the years vitiates any other mitigation. (See AG && 2(a)1, 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)4, \n2(a)(5), 2(a)(6), 2(a)(7), and 2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct, \nalcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n20 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \nWithdrawn - For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n21 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Applicant is 55 years old and has four years of college but no degree. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. He was indebted to eight separate creditors totaling approximately $ 46,755.00. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 2005, May 2007, and October 2007, reflect each of these delinquent debts. (See Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 9). The Applicant indicates that he plans to pay all of his delinquent debts. He has recently paid several smaller debts set forth in the SOR under allegations 1 (d), 1(e), 1(f) and 1(h).

On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on September 5, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on November 7, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 29,\n2008, and the hearing was scheduled for February 28, 2008.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented twelve exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through\n12.  The Applicant presented nine exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through\nI.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open after the hearing until\nclose of business on March 13, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\n\n2\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of three\npages referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on March 14, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 55 years old and has four years of\ncollege but no degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Engineer and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  He was\nindebted to eight separate creditors totaling approximately $ 46,755.00.  Credit reports\nof the Applicant dated October 2005, May 2007, and October 2007, reflect each of\nthese delinquent debts.  (See Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 9).  The Applicant indicates\nthat he plans to pay all of his delinquent debts.  He has recently paid several smaller\ndebts set forth in the SOR under allegations 1 (d), 1(e), 1(f) and 1(h).  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A, B, C and E).  The debts listed in allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(g) remain\nowing and total approximately $44,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 9).  \nMost of his debts are for delinquent taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS).  The Applicant attributes his indebtedness to various periods of unemployment\nthat occurred from July 1993 to March 1995, May 2000 to August 2000, January 2002\nto March 2002, and July 2003 to August 2003.  He also underwent back surgery in\n1997, and because of related complications was out of work for a year.  Moving costs,\nlow pay and a failed business venture also contributed to his indebtedness.\nFor tax purposes, from 1997 through 2007, the Applicant has tried to maintain his\nemployment outside of the United States in order to keep the foreign income exemption.\nThis exemption allowed him to avoid paying taxes on up to $75,000.00 of his income, as\nlong as he was employed outside of the United States for 330 days out of 365.  (Tr. p.\n55).  Several job positions he took during this period were not located outside of the\nUnited States for at least 330 days and therefore did not qualify for the exemption. The\nApplicant states that in 2002 he changed the exemptions on his tax return in order to\npay taxes on his income.    \n\n3\nThe Applicant has always filed his annual income tax returns on time, but on\nmany occasions did not have the money to pay the taxes.  The IRS determined that\nbecause the Applicant was employed in the United States during the years in question,\nhe was not eligible for the foreign income exemption and therefore owes the delinquent\ntaxes set forth in the SOR.  (Tr. p. 57).\nIn 1993, the Applicant was employed in country A and moved to country B for a\njob, until he returned to the United States.  His wife and children relocated from country\nA  to country C.  Sometime later, his family rejoined him in the United States.  In 2000,\nthe Applicant tried to start an investment company but was not successful.  His family\nleft the United States and moved back to country C.  He then remained in the United\nStates to work.  He worked in several different states in the United States but after\nseveral months was laid off.  Since May 2005, the Applicant has been consistently\nemployed full time.  (Tr. p. 47).\nFrom 1995 to 2000, the Applicant and his wife were separated.  The Applicant\nstates that he sent money to her to help with the children.  In January 2000, the\nApplicant and his wife divorced and he took on all of the debts from the marriage.  \nWith regard to the smaller debts alleged in the SOR, in July or August 2007, the\nApplicant paid them.  Allegations 1(d), a debt in the amount of $886.98;1(e), a debt in\nthe amount of $66.00; 1(f), a debt in the amount of $432.00; and 1(h), a debt in the\namount of $385.00 have been paid.  The Applicant also set up a monthly payment plan\nin the amount of $269.00 a month to pay the debt alleged in allegation 1(g) in the\namount of $12,063.03.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  He states that he makes the\npayment when he can.  (Tr. p. 72).\nA debt owed to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $7,913.00 for\ndelinquent taxes, interest and penalties for tax year 1998 remains owing.  A federal tax\nlien was filed against the Applicant on February 21, 2001.  (See Government Exhibit 8). \nA debt owed to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $21,452.71 for\ndelinquent taxes, interest and penalties for tax year 1999 remains owing.  A federal tax\nlien was filed against the Applicant on May 26, 2004.  This lien reflects both 1999 and\n2000 tax liability.  (See Government Exhibit 8). \nA debt owed to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $7,604.81 for\ndelinquent taxes, interest and penalties for tax year 2000 remains owing.  A federal tax\nlien was filed against the Applicant on May 26, 2004.  This lien reflects both 1999 and\n2000 tax liability.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).\nIt was not until November 2007, that the Applicant sent the IRS documentation\nconcerning his interest in setting up a payment plan.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  He is\nproposing to pay $2,600.00 a month toward his back taxes and is awaiting a response\nfrom the IRS.  He is now remarried and between the Applicant, (who brings home just\nunder $4,000 a month), and his present wife, (who brings home $3,600), he believes\n\n4\nthat he can pay that amount.  Since 2005, he has been withholding $100.00 per pay\nperiod from his check to pay his taxes.  The reason he has not made any payments\ntoward the delinquent debts any earlier is because his new wife, who is an Argentine\nnational, was unable to work until she was able to get a green card.\nPerformance evaluations for 2007 and 2008 reflect excellent ratings.  The\nApplicant is considered to be reliable and results oriented keeping the customer\nsatisfaction his primary objective.  He is referred to as a \u201cShining Star\u201d in Systems\nEngineering and Range Operations.  His planning, execution and follow-up work in the\nprogram has been well done.  He is an example for his peers to emulate, especially his\nemphasis on teaming and full disclosure of plans.  (See Applicant Exhibit I). \nThree letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant indicate\nthat at work, church and in their community, the Applicant is well respected and has\nbeen a good friend and neighbour.  He is recommended for a position of trust.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has experienced some difficult times over\nthe years that include a divorce, multiple periods of unemployment and relocations,\nheath problems, surgery and a failed business venture.  All of these things are taken\ninto considerations and have obviously contributed to his financial hardships.  However,\nthe evidence shows that he has been employed full time since 2005.  Since then, until\nrecently, he has ignored his delinquent debts.  He has recently paid off several of his\nsmaller debts, but has done very little to pay his enormous delinquent tax debt.  He\nremains indebted to the IRS in the amount of $44,000.00.  To his credit, he has recently\nrequested a payment plan from the IRS in an effort to begin to resolve his delinquent tax\nindebtedness, but has not heard back as to whether they agree with the proposal.         \nUpon review of his financial report, it appears that he has some disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his delinquent bills, but has not used it in any\nsignificant way to pay his delinquent taxes.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of\nthe mitigating factors apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not\nisolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\n\n7\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has just begun the process of financial rehabilitation and he\nhas a long way to go before his financial affairs are in order.    \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has promised his girlfriend that\nhe will not use drugs in the future.  He also knows that drugs will hurt his career.  He has decided\nnot to use drugs even if he did not need a security clearance.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n\n3\nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this appeal.  In arguing the issues on appeal, Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision does not take into account significant contrary record evidence.  The Board will address this\ncontention below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge favorably applied DIMC 26(b), concluding that Applicant had demonstrated an\nintent not to use drugs in the future.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that this conclusion\nwas reached without appropriate consideration of significant contrary record evidence, specifically\nthat Applicant used marijuana after submitting to a pre-employment drug test and that he used\nmarijuana after submitting the SCA.  The Board has previously held that use of marijuana following\na pre-employment drug test and after submitting a SCA significantly undercuts an applicant\u2019s claim\nto have demonstrated an intent not to use drugs in the future.  \u201cAs a matter of common sense, one\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.26(b).  \u201c(1) [D]isassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding\n2\nthe environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence[.]\u201d\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-22603 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 2004): \u201c. . . the Judge\u2019s decision cannot simply be silent\n3\nabout what, as a matter of common sense, appears to be . . . an important aspect of the case.\u201d\nSee Tr. at 96-99.   \u201cQ: [F]rom about 2000 to 2005, your marijuana use was approximately one to two times\n4\na year?  A: Yes . . . Q: Now, you started working . . . for [defense contractor] in 2003.  Correct?  A: Yes. . .  Q: So, you\nat least understood that you shouldn\u2019t be using illegal drugs when you started working at [defense contractor]?  A: Based\non the drug test . . . Q: [H]ow often did you have to take that drug test . . . .A: One time . . . there is a time period within\nyour application or within your acceptance letter, I think that\u2019s it . . . Q: So, do you recall when the drug test was?  A:\nIt would have been around December 2003.\u201d \n4\nwould expect that a person who has taken a drug test as a condition of employment would\nunderstand the importance of future abstention.  That Applicant used marijuana after such a test\nraises a substantial question as to whether she has demonstrated a serious intent to obey the law or\nwhether she has refrained from drug use simply in order to qualify for employment.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n06-18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  \nIn the case under consideration here, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s having used marijuana after\ncompleting his SCA in evaluating whether the Government has presented a prima facie case for\nGuideline H disqualifying conditions.  However, he did not provide a serious discussion of\nApplicant\u2019s future intent in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  To the\ncontrary, the Judge\u2019s analysis of future intent consisted simply in repeating almost verbatim three\nof the illustrative examples listed under DIMC 26(b).   Such conclusory language does not explain\n2\nwhy it is that Applicant can be said to have demonstrated, rather than merely having promised, an\nintent to refrain from future drug use.  While Judges are presumed to have considered all the record\nevidence, some matters, such as those under discussion here, are sufficiently significant to warrant\ndiscussion of them.   The Judge\u2019s decision is deficient in that regard .\n3\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s having\nused marijuana after submitting his SCA did not raise a security concern under Guideline E.  Again,\nthe Board finds this argument persuasive.  The disqualifying conditions listed under each Guideline\nare illustrative only, not exhaustive and exclusive.  In analyzing cases before them, Judges must be\nguided by common sense and with a view toward making a reasoned determination consistent with\nthe interests of national security.  The general security concern raised by Guideline E is that\n\u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment . . . or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.15.  The Board agrees with Department Counsel that\nApplicant\u2019s having used marijuana despite his employer\u2019s policy against such activity,  and his use\n4\nafter submitting his SCA, raise serious questions about his judgment and, therefore, his fitness for\na clearance.  Under the facts of this case, this activity raises a security concern under Guideline E,\nand the Judge\u2019s decision on this matter should have been made in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden\nof persuasion as to mitigation.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government had not met its initial\nburden of producing substantial evidence of a Guideline E security concern is not sustainable.  \n\n5\nThe Board concludes that the best way to address the errors described above is to remand the\ncase to the Judge for a new decision.  This decision should examine the extent to which Applicant\nhas met his burden of persuasion, both as to mitigation as well as to the whole-person, under both\nGuidelines E and H.  In doing so, the decision should address the extent to which Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances fall within the precedent set forth in ISCR Case No. 06-18270 supra.\n     \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Jean E.

On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on October 2, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 13, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 8, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing on January 28, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1\nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand two other witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. He submitted Exhibits A\nthrough L, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\n\n2\nFebruary 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e., and he\ndenied 1.b. and 2.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He received\na Bachelor of Science degree in 2000. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists 5 allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under Adjudicative\nGuideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately 1995\nthrough October 2005. He used it one last time on July 21, 2006. \nApplicant testified that he never used marijuana in high school. He started using\nit when he began attending college in 1995. It was sporadic, but for one quarter in 1998,\nhis usage increased to one or two times a week. When he noticed that it was affecting\nhis grades, his usage decreased to approximately once a month.   After he graduated in\n2000, his use of marijuana decreased even more significantly to one or two times a year\nuntil his second to last usage in October 2005.  He ceased usage in October 2005,\nbecause he was aware that he would be applying for a SCA. However, Applicant\nconceded that he used it one last time on July 21, 2006, when it was offered to him on\nhis birthday. \nHe testified credibly that he intends to never use marijuana again. He explained\nthat he has committed to his girlfriend that he will not use it again. He is planning a life\nwith his girlfriend, and he does not want drugs to play a part in that life. He also testified\nthat using Marijuana would hurt his career, about which he is now more serious. Finally,\nhe testified that even if he did not need a security clearance, he has made a decision\nthat he will not use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \n1.b. Applicant used marijuana in July 21, 2006, after he executed a Security\nClearance Application (SCA) on April 26, 2006. In the SOR, the Government alleged\n\n3\nthat Applicant knew he could not use drugs while holding a security clearance. Applicant\ndenied this allegation in his RSOR, although during his testimony, he conceded that he\ndid use the marijuana one last time after applying for a security clearance. He described\nit as \u201ca lapse in judgement\u201d (Tr at 103). He also concluded, \u201cin retrospect, it was very\nfoolish\u201d (Tr at 104).\n1.c.  Applicant has purchased some of the marijuana that he has used. \n1.d.  Applicant used mushrooms in the Netherlands in 1999. He testified that he\npurchased the mushrooms at a store, and he was under the belief that the mushrooms\nwere legal in the Netherlands. He never again used mushrooms or any other\nhallucinogenic drug after that incident. \n1.e.  Applicant used Ecstasy in 2002. He testified that his girlfriend gave him a\nthird of a pill, which she identified as Ecstacy. He felt no effect from the pill. He has\nnever used Ecstacy since that time, and he has no intension of using it in the future.\nApplicant is no longer with that girlfriend. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. As discussed in 1.b., above, Applicant executed a SCA on April 26, 2006\n(Exhibit 1). He thereafter used marijuana on one occasion on July 21, 2006. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he applied for a security\nclearance exhibits questionable judgement and unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations. \nMitigation\nApplicant received the very prestigious Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts\nof America in 1993 when he was 16. He submitted the Eagle Scout certification and a\nnumber of Eagle Scout commendations from important public figures (Exhibit J).\nHe also submitted his performance evaluations form his employer for years 2004,\n2005, and 2006 (Exhibit G). His evaluations were fairly positive and his work efforts\nseem to be moving in the right direction. \nFinally, two witnesses, who are coworkers of Applicant, testified on his behalf.\nApplicant also offered into evidence character letters from individuals who know or have\nknown him in his professional or private life (Exhibit E). They all were extremely\nlaudatory in describing  Applicant\u2019s high integrity, reliability, and good judgement. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of\n\n5\nmarijuana, and his use after applying for a security clearance is of concern, especially in\nlight of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct\npertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse), and (c) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s extremely limited use of any illegal substance in the last\nfew years, and his demonstrated intention not to continue using drugs in the future, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within Mitigating Condition (MC) 26. (b)\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used and (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nhim.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant executed a\nSCA on April 26, 2006, and he thereafter used marijuana on July 21, 2006. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after completing a SCA does show poor\njudgement, it was done only on one occasion, and he testified that he has realized the\nfolly of such conduct. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that no DCs apply.  I resolve\nParagraph 2, Guideline E, for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n6\nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s strong and credible\ntestimony that he will not use any illegal substance in the future, together with his\nachievement of Eagle Scout and his positive employment evaluations, and the laudatory\nletters of recommendation and testimony, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on October 2, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 13, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 8, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing on January 28, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1\nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand two other witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. He submitted Exhibits A\n\n2\nthrough L, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nFebruary 5, 2008.\nOn February 7, 2008, I issued a written decision granting Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance. On May 27, 2008, the Appeal Board  issued a Appeal Board\nDecision remanding the case to me, requesting further processing of the case.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e., and he\ndenied 1.b. and 2.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He received\na Bachelor of Science degree in 2000. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists 5 allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under Adjudicative\nGuideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately 1995\nthrough October 2005. He used it one last time on July 21, 2006. \nApplicant testified that he never used marijuana in high school. He started using\nit when he began attending college in 1995. It was sporadic, but for one quarter in 1998,\nhis usage increased to one or two times a week. When he noticed that it was affecting\nhis grades, his usage decreased to approximately once a month.   After he graduated in\n2000, his use of marijuana decreased even more significantly to one or two times a year\nuntil his second to last usage in October 2005.  He ceased usage in October 2005,\nbecause he was aware that he would be applying for a SCA. However, Applicant\nconceded that he used it one last time on July 21, 2006, when it was offered to him on\nhis birthday. \nHe testified credibly that he intends to never use marijuana again. He explained\nthat he has committed to his girlfriend that he will not use it again. He is planning a life\nwith his girlfriend, and he does not want drugs to play a part in that life. He also testified\nthat using marijuana would hurt his career, about which he is now more serious. Finally,\n\n3\nhe testified that even if he did not need a security clearance, he has made a decision\nthat he will not use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \n1.b. Applicant used marijuana in July 21, 2006, after he executed a Security\nClearance Application (SCA) on April 26, 2006. In the SOR, the Government alleged\nthat Applicant knew he could not use drugs while holding a security clearance. Applicant\ndenied this allegation in his RSOR, although during his testimony, he conceded that he\ndid use the marijuana one last time after applying for a security clearance. He described\nit as \u201ca lapse in judgement\u201d (Tr at 103). He also concluded, \u201cin retrospect, it was very\nfoolish\u201d (Tr at 104).\n1.c.  Applicant has purchased some of the marijuana that he has used. \n1.d.  Applicant used mushrooms in the Netherlands in 1999. He testified that he\npurchased the mushrooms at a store, and he was under the belief that the mushrooms\nwere legal in the Netherlands. He never again used mushrooms or any other\nhallucinogenic drug after that incident. \n1.e.  Applicant used Ecstasy in 2002. He testified that his girlfriend gave him a\nthird of a pill, which she identified as Ecstacy. He felt no effect from the pill. He has\nnever used Ecstacy since that time, and he has no intension of using it in the future.\nApplicant is no longer with that girlfriend. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. As discussed in 1.b., above, Applicant executed a SCA on April 26, 2006\n(Exhibit 1). He thereafter used marijuana on one occasion on July 21, 2006. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he applied for a security\nclearance exhibits questionable judgement and unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations. \nMitigation\nApplicant received the very prestigious Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts\nof America in 1993 when he was 16. He submitted the Eagle Scout certification and a\nnumber of Eagle Scout commendations from important public figures (Exhibit J).\nHe also submitted his performance evaluations form his employer for years 2004,\n2005, and 2006 (Exhibit G). His evaluations were fairly positive and his work efforts\nseem to be moving in the right direction. \nFinally, two witnesses, who are coworkers of Applicant, testified on his behalf.\nApplicant also offered into evidence character letters from individuals who know or have\nknown him in his professional or private life (Exhibit E). They all were extremely\nlaudatory in describing  Applicant\u2019s high integrity, reliability, and good judgement. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of\nmarijuana, and his use after applying for a security clearance is of concern, especially in\nlight of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct\npertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse), and (c) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s extremely limited use of any illegal substance in the last\nfew years, and his demonstrated intention not to continue using drugs in the future, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within Mitigating Condition (MC) 26. (b)\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used and (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nhim.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1, Guideline H of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant executed a\nSCA on April 26, 2006, and he thereafter used marijuana on July 21, 2006. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after completing a SCA does show poor\njudgement, it was done only on one occasion, and he testified that he has realized the\nfolly of such conduct. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that no DCs apply.  I resolve\nParagraph 2, Guideline E, for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n6\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s strong and credible\ntestimony that he will not use any illegal substance in the future, together with his\nachievement of Eagle Scout and his positive employment evaluations, and the laudatory\nletters of recommendation and testimony, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFurther Discussion of Drug involvement and Personal Conduct Under the\nRemand Parameters\nThe following are some of the factors that were considered in concluding that\nApplicant had mitigated the Guideline H, Drug Involvement concerns, although not all of\nthem were articulated in the Decision: From 2000 to 2005, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana\nwas reduced to one or two times a year. In 2005,  Applicant made a conscious decision\nto abstain from all drug usage because he was going to apply for a security clearance.\nHe used marijuana on only one additional time after he applied for a security clearance,\nand that was at his birthday party in July 2006, when it was offered to him, and he\nsuccumbed. While there is no question that he used extremely poor judgement by\naccepting and using the marijuana that was offered to him, as he absolutely conceded\nat the hearing, I considered that not only did he not pursue the marijuana that he used\non that one occasion, but once he realized his mistake, there is no record that he ever\nused any illegal substance again. \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s testimony extremely credible, based not only on\nwhat he said, and on the character evidence on behalf of Applicant, but also on what I\nfound to be his sincere and believable manner in voice, eye contact, and mannerism,\nqualities that can really only be judged by hearing and watching Applicant during his\ntestimony. The testimony that I determined to be so credible included Applicant\u2019s strong\ndeclaration that he has become very serious about his career, and he would absolutely\nnot use marijuana in the future, since that could potentially damage the career. He also\ntestified that he had a very serious relationship with a woman, with whom he hoped to\nestablish a family, and he promised this woman that he would never use any illegal\ndrugs in the future.  \nBased on all of the evidence introduced at the hearing, I determined that\nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion, in July 2006, after he applied for a security\nclearance, and he had not used it for approximately one and one half years before the\nhearing. Additionally, he has made a sincere determination not to use any illegal\n\n7\nsubstance in the future. He has become far more mature and serious about his career\nand his personal relationships, and he has decided that marijuana is not going to be a\npart of his life in the future. While he may still have some minimal contact with\nindividuals with whom he had used marijuana in the past, Applicant indicated that they\nalso had matured, and he no longer associated in a manner where drugs were likely to\nbe present. Finally even if drugs were present where he was, his testimony was\nconvincing that it would not influence him to use drugs in the future. \nUnder the whole person concept, as was discussed in the Decision, I considered\nApplicant\u2019s achievement of his Eagle Scout Award, which stresses duty, honor to\ncountry, perseverance, and many other positive traits, as an extremely high honor for a\nyoung man to achieve. I also considered the four character letters submitted by\nApplicant (Exhibit E), in which individuals who have known Applicant in business and\npersonal settings, described him as trustworthy, loyal, responsible, and honest. Finally,\nthe two witnesses, who testified on behalf of Applicant, were also extremely positive\nabout Applicant\u2019s good character and trustworthiness. \nRegarding the Guideline E Personal Conduct concerns, there is no doubt that\nApplicant exhibited extremely poor judgement when he used marijuana, after he began\nworking for his employer and especially on the one occasion after he had applied for a\nsecurity clearance. While an argument could be made that Disqualifying Condition (f)\napplies, the evidence has not established that Applicant\u2019s conduct violated a written or\nrecorded commitment made by Applicant to his employer as a condition of his\nemployment. No evidence was ever introduced as to what Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s drug\npolicy was, nor that Applicant had been informed about said policy. Nevertheless,\nApplicant\u2019s poor judgement could be considered adversely under Guideline E.\nHowever, I have considered Mitigating Condition (d) to be applicable and controlling,\nsince Applicant has acknowledged that his use of marijuana after applying for a security\nclearance showed poor judgement, and he has changed his lifestyle by being more\ninvolved in his career and beginning to establish a serious relationship, so that this\ninappropriate and illegal behavior is unlikely to recur.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 27, married but separated, and has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. The Applicant has been arrested four times since 1998. Only one of these arrests resulted in a conviction. The Applicant was first arrested in April 1998.

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCandace Le\u2019i, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant has been arrested four times (twice in 1998, 2000 and 2004).  Two of the\narrests (1998 and 2004) did not result in charges because the Applicant did not commit the offense.\nFor the most serious offense, in 2000, the Applicant served 30 days in jail and was on probation for\nthree years.  He has not engaged in criminal conduct since 2000 and shows considerable evidence\nof rehabilitation.  Applicant is now eligible for a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn March 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 5, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on August 3, 2007.  It was received by the\nundersigned on August 8, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on August 16, 2007.\nA hearing was held on September 4, 2007, at which the Government presented two\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted six exhibits.\nThe transcript was received on September 12, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 27, married but separated, and has a high school diploma.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance previously granted in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nThe Applicant has been arrested four times since 1998. Only one of these arrests resulted in\na conviction.  \nThe Applicant was first arrested in April 1998.  This incident involved his accidentally hitting\na teacher with his elbow when he was still in high school.  The teacher submitted a statement to the\nDistrict Attorney stating that the Applicant did not intend to hit her and the charges were dismissed.\n(Transcript at 26-27, Government Exhibit 2 at 2, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)\nThe Applicant was next arrested in October 1998 for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.\nHe was involved in a motor vehicle accident after drinking.  At that time the Applicant was only 18\nyears old.  He called the police after the accident and was arrested.  The charges were subsequently\ndropped.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months by the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n(Transcript at 28-29.)\nIn March 2000 the Applicant was involved in a serious incident involving an underage\nwoman.  The young woman, who was 17 at the time, became sexually involved with the Applicant\n\n3\nand two of his friends.  During this incident, the woman was intoxicated.  The Applicant did not\nhave intercourse with the victim, but he did engage in sexual activity with her.  His two friends did\nhave intercourse with the woman.  (Transcript at 29-36, Government Exhibit 1 at 34-35.)\nAfter the night was over, the victim filed charges against the Applicant and his two friends.\nThe Applicant was charged with Forcible Rape, Rape of a Drugged Victim and Child Endangerment,\nPossible Injury/Death (felony).  The Applicant pled no contest to the charge of Child Endangerment\nand was sentenced to 60 months probation and 100 days in jail.  He actually served 30 days.\n(Transcript at 36-39, 68-70.)  In June 2003 the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and, in August\n2003 the Applicant successfully petitioned to have the conviction set aside, a plea of not guilty\nentered and the complaint dismissed.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s final arrest occurred in October 2004.  On this occasion the Applicant\u2019s wife\naccused him of hitting her while she held their infant son.  He was charged with Inflicting Corporal\nInjury on Spouse and Child Cruelty.  The Applicant has consistently stated that this incident did not\nhappen.  (Transcript at 39-48.)  The Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a signed statement supporting his\nversion of the facts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  She states:\nAt that time [October 6, 2004] I made a false accusation against [the\nApplicant] in order to see my grandmother in New York who at the time was very\nsick and was diagnosed with Cancer. . . .  The reason I did the false accusation was\nbecause I had asked [the Applicant] if I could go with our son . . . to see my\ngrandmother and he told me no that he didn\u2019t think it was a very good idea, because\nof [the son\u2019s] young age.  That\u2019s when I got very upset and found out that if I press\ncharges on him that I would be able to go to New York without needing his consent.\nPostpartum and the fact we had got into a disagreement the day before [our]\nanniversary gave me the incentive to do what I did.\nThe case never went to court.  The Applicant\u2019s wife recanted her statement about what the\nApplicant had done and the case was dropped.  (Transcript at 48, Government Exhibit 1 at 33-34.)\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant submitted a letter of reference from his Team Lead.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nShe states that she asked the Applicant to submit his resume for a job after he was laid off by his\nprevious employer.  She states that the Applicant is \u201ca hardworking dependable employee with a\nstrong work ethic.\u201d  That is also shown by a Surveillance Inspection from August 2007 submitted\nby the Applicant.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nA Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force submitted a statement saying he believes the\nApplicant to be \u201can intelligent, capable, dedicated, professional and personable young man.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nPOLICIES\n\n4\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in repeated acts of criminal misconduct that demonstrates\npoor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\n\n5\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has been engaged in several criminal acts between 1998 and 2004 (Guideline J).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nevidence shows that two of the criminal incidents involving the Applicant were resolved before trial\nbecause the Applicant did not engage in the alleged criminal conduct.  These were the cases\ninvolving the battery on a teacher in 1998 and the spousal abuse charge in 2004.  This last incident\nappears to have been the result of a serious misunderstanding between the Applicant and his spouse\nthat she allowed to get out of hand.\nAs for the second 1998 arrest, the Applicant admits that he had been drinking, though he was\nunderage.  The charge was dismissed and the results were that the Applicant had his driver\u2019s license\nsuspended, and he does not drink and drive anymore.\nThe 2000 arrest and conviction are the most serious.  The Applicant admits to using very\npoor judgment on that occasion.  His conduct is not condoned, but it is to his benefit that he\nsuccessfully completed probation and the charges were dismissed almost four years ago.  Seven years\nhave passed since this incident, and the evidence shows that the Applicant is a much more mature\nman than he was at that time.  He shows considerable contrition and an understanding of how this\nincident occurred and a credible intent not to engage in such conduct again.\nThe following Disqualifying Condition applies to this case: 31(a) A single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses.\n\n6\nThe following Mitigating Conditions also apply to this case: 32(a) So much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; 32(c) Evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, 32(d) There is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement.\nIn addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the\nApplicant's favor.  The Applicant shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor 6), and, under\nthe circumstances of this case, the probability that the Applicant will engage in any conduct like this\nagain are virtually nil (factor 9). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.:\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H. Ross\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She has\nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, and\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security clearance\nfor Applicant. DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 11, 2007, detailing the basis for\nits preliminary decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (foreign preference) and\nGuideline B (foreign influence). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2. 1992), as amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved\nby the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 19, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2007. With the consent of the\nparties, and to accommodate their schedules, I convened a hearing on September 17, 2007, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for\nApplicant. The Government offered five exhibits for admission into the record, marked as GE 1-5.\nThe exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. The Government also offered for\nadministrative notice HE I-IX. Applicant objected to HE IX as being argumentative. I took\nadministrative notice of HE I-VIII. I did not take administrative notice of HE IX, because it was\nmerely a summary of information included within all of the other HE exhibits. Applicant testified\non her behalf in addition to three witnesses, and offered 24 exhibits, marked as AE A-X. The\nexhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non September 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old woman who came to the U.S. from Iran with her husband in 1976\nso they could complete their education. Both earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in Iran and master\u2019s degrees\nfrom U.S. universities.

Her husband is 64 years old and has worked as an accountant, in professorial\n2\npositions and in senior administration positions for a state university for 26 years.  They have been\n3\nmarried since 1970 and have one son, who was born in the Iran. He has a Ph.D., is a neuroscientist,\nand is married and living in the U.S.  Applicant, her husband, and their son became naturalized U.S.\n4\ncitizens in October 1985. Applicant is a first time applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant worked in the registrar\u2019s office at a U.S. university from 1979 until 1989.  She left\n5\nin 1989 and was self-employed as a consultant to a bank as an information systems analyst until\n2000.  From 1990 to 1998 she taught engineering courses at the university where she was formally\n6\nemployed.  In 2000, she started her own company and is the owner, president and chief executive\n7\nofficer. Her company employs eight people.  In 2004 she was certified to teach courses in a\n8\nneighboring state\u2019s university system.9\nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s parents are deceased. He has a brother living in the U.S. who is a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. The only family he has remaining in Iran are two sisters. Applicant and her\nhusband have been estranged from the sisters since their wedding day in 1970 when a family\ndisagreement occurred. Neither Applicant nor her husband has had any communication with them\nsince their wedding day. Prior to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s death in 2005, she would advise them\nabout the sisters\u2019 well being. Since her death, neither Applicant or her husband has learned anything\nabout them, nor have they sought any information about them. They do not know if they are still\nliving. There remains a bitter estrangement and neither Applicant or her husband has had any contact\nwith them in the past nor do they intend to in the future. Since her husband\u2019s mother\u2019s death they\nhave not been in contact with his brother. Her husband has no other living relatives in Iran.  Her\n10\nhusband\u2019s family supported the pre-1979 regime and after the revolution three of his family\nmembers were executed, two within 48 hours of each other.  Her husband has not returned to Iran\n11\nsince coming to the U.S. in 1976 and has no intentions of ever returning.  He has not held an Iranian\n12\npassport since becoming a U.S. citizen. He has not maintained any contacts with anyone in Iran.\n\nTr. 134-136.\n13\nTr. 142.\n14\nTr. 142-144.\n15\nId.\n16\nTr. 145.\n17\nTr. 246. There was a great deal of confusion as to when Applicant went to the ISIR to assist her father.\n18\nApplicant repeatedly was confusing 1998 and 1988 and some of the testimony interchanged 1998 and 1988. Although\nshe would firmly state one date, she would then confuse it with the other. I do not find she was untruthful or not credible,\nbut rather she genuinely and unintentionally confused the dates, thereby making it confusing for everyone.\nTr. 256.\n19\n4\nApplicant has four sisters and two brothers who are all naturalized U.S. citizens living in the\nU.S.  Her mother is 82 years old and a naturalized U.S. citizen living in the U.S. Her father was a\n13\nnaturalized U.S. citizen and died in 2006. He is buried in the U.S. She has no immediate family\nliving in Iran.14\nIn 1988 Applicant obtained an Iranian passport so she could bring her father into the U.S.\nas a permanent resident.  She was not permitted to do the paperwork through the Interests Section\n15\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran at the Embassy of Pakistan (ISIR) without a valid Iranian passport.16\nThis is the office that a U.S. citizen must use because there are no diplomatic ties with Iran. She did\nnot use the passport for travel at that time, but only to assist her father in coming to the U.S.17\nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s father wanted to return to Iran to retrieve family heirlooms of\nsentimental value that were in storage.  They had to go to the ISIR. She could not gain entry to ISIR\n18\nunless she had a valid Iranian passport. Applicant accompanied her father to the ISIR because his\nlanguage skills were limited. She filled out the application to renew her expired Iranian passport.\nShe stated she listed her citizenship as U.S. A special stamp was required on all Iranian passports\nto enter and exit Iran. Her father never returned because he became ill with cancer before he could\nbegin the trip.  She did not use the Iranian passport at this time. \n19\nApplicant renewed her Iranian passport to travel to Iran in 2002. She did not think she could\ntravel on a U.S. passport. Her father was ill with cancer and his brother was tragically killed in a car\naccident. Her father wanted to go to the funeral in Iran, but due to his health Applicant volunteered\nto be the family representative who would accompany her mother to attend the funeral. Her other\nsiblings all had jobs or contracts with the U.S. government or had children to care for that made it\nmore difficult for them to make the trip. Her parents were devastated by the death and it was not\nfeasible for her elderly mother to travel alone. Applicant needed her Iranian passport to enter Iran.\nShe exited the U.S. on her U.S. passport and entered Iran on her Iranian passport. They planned to\nstay in Iran for 40 days to observe the culturally regimented grieving process and religious\nobservances. They stayed for approximately three to four weeks and left early because her mother\nbecame ill. Applicant commented that her mother is Muslim; however Applicant does not follow\n\nThe information in this paragraph is at Tr. 145-150,198-199.\n20\nTr. 200-202.\n21\nTr. 45, 153, 203.\n22\nAE F and G are documents verifying Applicant\u2019s dental treatment and their translations.\n23\nThe information in this paragraph is at Tr. 154-162, 204-207..\n24\n5\nthat faith, but follows her heart. She did not reconnect with any relatives other than to observe the\ncustoms associated with the funeral.  \n20\nIn October/November 2004, Applicant returned to Iran for dental surgery. She had her\nIranian passport stamped again and it was not renewed, but rather the validity of the passport was\nextended.  She had dental problems and was told by her U.S. dentist that the implant procedures\n21\nthat were required were considerably less expensive in Iran. Her dentist in the U.S. recommended\na U.S.-trained Iranian dentist in Iran. Applicant explained she needed five dental implants. The cost\nof the implants in the U.S. were approximately $3,000 to $3,800 per tooth, costing approximately\n$15,000-$19,000 for the whole procedure. The same dental procedures in Iran would cost\napproximately $1,800, plus travel expenses.  \n22\nThrough her dentist in the U.S. she was provided the name of Dr. M in Iran. She had\nobtained Dr. M\u2019s name from Dr. D who is an Iranian born gynecologist in the U.S. It was Dr. D\u2019s\nbrother Dr. X who was the dentist in Iran who worked with Dr. M who would perform the surgery.\nApplicant contacted Dr. M\u2019s office in Iran and made arrangements to have the surgery done in Iran.\nShe used her frequent flyer miles to travel to Iran. She did not have any difficulty entering the\ncountry on her Iranian passport. She had the surgery and stayed at a hotel afterwards.  Dr. X\u2019s wife\n23\nlearned Applicant was recuperating in a hotel by herself and provided her comfort with food. Neither\nApplicant or Dr. X\u2019s wife were acquainted with each other prior to this trip. Dr. X\u2019s wife also\ninsisted that Applicant stay in their home during her convalescence, which Applicant accepted. She\nstayed with them approximately two weeks. She did not pay them for their hospitality. She traveled\nto the clinic by private taxi every other day for two weeks. She did not go anywhere else, but stayed\nin bed. Due to the bruising and the necessity to ensure Applicant had healed properly from the\nsurgery, Dr. M determined it would be a mistake to finish the procedure on this trip. She had no\ncontact with the Iranian government. She did not contact her estranged sisters-in-law while in Iran\nor any other distant relative.  \n24\nIn May 2005 Applicant returned to Iran to complete the dental procedure. Again she did not\nhave difficulty entering Iran on her Iranian passport. She stayed in Iran for three weeks and the\ndental procedure was completed. While there she stayed in a hotel for two weeks and in Dr. X\u2019s\nhome for one week. She did not have any contact with any of her distant relatives. She maintained\nsome contact with Dr. X\u2019s wife in 2006 on a monthly basis, but has not had contact with her this\nyear. Applicant visited Dr. X\u2019s wife once while she was visiting her relatives in the U.S. They had\ndinner at a restaurant.

She has had no further contact and no plans to see her in the future.  She also\n25\n26\nhad some contact with Dr. M after her final check up in 2005 as follow-up to her surgery and to\nensure there were no dental or medical issues with her teeth implants. 27\nWhen Applicant renewed her Iranian passport and traveled to Iran she was unaware that her\nactions could have future security clearance implications. Apparently, whenever she made a trip to\nIran, the ISIR required a special stamp validating her passport. She has unconditionally renounced\nher Iranian citizenship and returned her passport to the ISIR.  She admitted that her renunciation\n28\nwas to ease the process to get a security clearance and also that she no longer needs her passport.\nShe testified that by returning her passport and renouncing her citizenship in Iran she can never\nreturn there. She is certain her name is on a list that would cause her problems if she attempted to\nreturn to Iran. She has permanently severed all ties with Iran.  She provided the postal return receipt\n29\nverifying the ISIR received her passport.  She has not received any acknowledgment from them.\n30\n31\nApplicant and her husband have estimated assets in the U.S. of approximately $10 million\ndollars.  They own a house in the U.S. valued at $1.25 million.  They have no assets in Iran.  \n32\n33\n34\nApplicant has a reputation as a very helpful person with a big heart. Her husband would often\nask her to help Iranian foreign students, especially females with personal questions as they were\nattempting to adapt culturally to the U.S.  She would not only assist with educational advice, but\n35\nalso personal advice. She is viewed as a mentor to these foreign students. She is very giving of her\ntime and experience.  She was often asked to do the same when she was working at the registrar\u2019s\n36\noffice of the university where she worked. She would serve as a translator and a mentor. She was\nnot paid for her services, but did it voluntarily.

After the tragedy of\n38\nSeptember 11, 2001, the number of Iranian students diminished and she did not have as much\nopportunity to help.  She is considered honest, trustworthy, and a warm individual who truly wants\n39\nto help others. \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested\nin a learned religious scholar.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  The\n40\n41\nPresident\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated that the United States \u201cmay face no greater\nchallenge from a single country than from Iran.\u201d42\nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction;\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism;\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; \n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record; and\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.43\nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\nIran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups.  \n44\nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the\nIranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, including\nof minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention, including\nprolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe restrictions on civil liberties-speech,\npress, assembly, association, movement and privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion;\nofficial corruption; violence and legal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and\nreligious minorities, and homosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n45\nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel\nto Iran.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n52\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n53\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.54\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but\n55\n\nSee v.

Appellant is recognized as a citizen of Iran because\nshe was born there. After becoming a U.S. citizen she obtained an Iranian passport and traveled to\nIran three times on it. I find both disqualifying conditions apply.\n\n10\nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC). I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry), FP MC 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship),\nFP MC 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before\nthe individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor), and FP MC 11(e) (the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated). Appellant is considered a citizen by Iran because she was born there. However, she\nalso acknowledged her citizenship by obtaining and validating her Iranian passport after she became\na U.S. citizen. So her citizenship is not based solely on her birth, but also by her latter actions of\nusing her Iranian birth to obtain an Iranian passport. I find FP MC 11(a) does not apply. It is\nimportant to note that Applicant renewed and validated her Iranian passport for strictly personal\nreasons that were not in any way political. She did so to accommodate her elderly father so he could\nreturn to Iran, although she never used it for that purpose. She used it to assist her mother to attend\na funeral there. Finally, she did so for her own personal reasons for dental treatment that was more\naffordable there. By virtue of using her Iranian passport she was afforded entry into the country with\nno difficulty, thereby exercising rights and privileges afforded citizens of Iran. Therefore, I find FP\nMC 11(c) does not apply.\nApplicant was unaware of the issues related to having a foreign passport after becoming a\nU.S. citizen and on her security clearance application. She has since unconditionally renounced her\nIranian citizenship and returned her passport to the ISIR. She believes she will never be permitted\nto return to Iran again because she will be on a list by the government and it will be unsafe for her\nto be there. She has no future intentions to return to Iran. She does not believe she will need to go\nback for any family reasons, because all of her family are in the U.S. She returned to Iran for dental\ntreatment, but at the time had not applied for a security clearance. All of the people of Iranian\ndescent that she currently has contact with are naturalized U.S. citizens and not an issue regardless\nof where the contact occurred. The contact she had with her dentist and Dr. X\u2019s wife has ceased.\nApplicant has done all she can to prove she does not have a preference for Iran nor consider herself\na dual citizen. I find FP MC 11(b) and (e) apply.\nForeign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) and\nespecially FI DC 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), FI DC\n7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict\nof interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and\nthe individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information),\nFI DC 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\n\n11\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion),\nand FI DC 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk\nof foreign influence or exploitation). Applicant had contact in 2004 and 2005 with her dentist in Iran.\nShe also had contact with Dr. X\u2019s wife for a period of time in 2006.She and her husband have had\nno contact with his sisters in more than 37 years. Neither have any friends or family with living in\nIran with whom they have contact. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions and\nconclude none apply. However, in an abundance of caution I will address the contacts in a broad\noverview. \nThere is no indication that Applicant\u2019s contact with Dr. X\u2019s wife created a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. There is also no indication\nthat these connections created a potential conflict of interest. The connection to the dentist was\nstrictly professional and ended when her treatment ended. Her connection to Dr. X\u2019s wife was\npersonal, but it was merely a gesture of kindness offered by the wife. The relationship has ended and\nthere is no further contact. There was no evidence that the connection to the foreign people created\nor could create any conflict of interest. Applicant has severed ties and has no contact with any\nforeign citizens of Iran. Applicant\u2019s does have contact with immigrants from Iran, but all of them\nare U.S. citizens. She and her husband have considerable assets in the U.S. They have no assets in\nIran.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) especially (FI\nMC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with the foreign person, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), FI MC (b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest), FI MC 8(c) (contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation), and FI MC 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign\nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and\ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual).\nApplicant\u2019s relationships in Iran have been severed. The contacts she did have were so she\ncould obtain dental care and to assist her mother to attend her uncle\u2019s funeral. There are no\nrestriction on contacts with American citizens who were from Iran and became naturalized. It is\nundisputed that Iran creates a heightened security concern. However, I find Applicant does not have\nany contacts in Iran. She visited Iran prior to applying for a security clearance, has not been there\nfor more than two years, and has no intentions of returning. There is simply no one there that could\ninfluence her and create a security concern. Whatever relatives she may have there through her\nhusband are estranged. Her contacts regarding her dental care no longer exist and even if she wanted\nto she could not return because she has surrendered her passport and renounced her citizenship. She\nand her husband have no financial interests in Iran. Whatever sense of obligation she had to her\nfamily to return to Iran has ceased since her father died. He is buried in the U.S. and her mother is\nelderly and her children all live in the U.S. as citizens. There is little likelihood that Applicant has\nany conflict of interest, but if she did it is clear due to her longstanding loyalty to the U.S. and the\n\n12\nlikely minimal nature of the conflict, she would resolve it in favor of the U.S. I find all the above\nmentioned mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nDirective to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances;\n(2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or\nabsence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nGuidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1976 and been\na U.S. citizen since 1985. She did not return to Iran until 2002 and that was to help her mother\ntravel. She traveled again to Iran in 2004 and 2005 for dental care. She has no family contacts in\nIran. She and her husband are estranged from his two sisters who live there. All of their other\nimmediate family live in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens. She has no friends she is in contact with\nthere. She and her husband have substantial assets in the U.S. Applicant returned her passport to\nISIR and has renounced her citizenship, knowing she can never return there and has no wishes to\nreturn. She is a well-regarded professional woman, with a business of her own and a warm and open\nheart to many people, but especially those having difficulty transitioning to a new culture. She has\nno contact with the Iranian government and knows no one who does.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and B, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns based on Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence. Accordingly, I conclude\nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nher a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n13\nParagraph 1.

He received a five-year deferred adjudication with\nsupervised probation to run concurrently. Upon evaluating the isolated nature of the conduct, its\nsurrounding circumstances, Applicant\u2019s remorse, and his probation officer\u2019s strong, unequivocal\ncharacter reference, I conclude he has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nOctober 1, 2007, scheduling it for October 23, 2007. During the hearing, I received three government\nexhibits, 16 Applicant exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to allow him an opportunity to submit an exhibit that he had been unable to obtain in advance\nof the hearing. Within the time allotted, he submitted it and I incorporated into the record. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on October 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted the lone SOR allegation and I have incorporated it into the findings of fact.\nIn addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old married man with one daughter, age six.

Also, he is a union foreman representing 24 employees.\n5\n6\nApproximately six years ago, Applicant purchased an undeveloped tract of land in a rural area,\nand built a home. At or about the same time, his neighbor purchased an adjacent tract and began\nbuilding a home. For three years, they coexisted peacefully.  Then, in approximately 2003, a property\n7\n\nTr.33.\n8\nTr. 46.\n9\nTr. 34.\n10\nTr. 32.\n11\nId.\n12\nExhibit 3, Indictment, dated April 1, 2004; Id.\n13\nId.., Tr. 39.\n14\nAnswer.\n15\nExhibit K.\n16\nTr. 49.\n17\n3\ndispute ensued over the proper location of a fence the neighbor sought to build. Subsequently, the\nneighbor grew hostile, cursing at Applicant for the slightest trespass, such as any time grass clippings\nfrom Applicant\u2019s yard accidentally blew onto his yard. On multiple occasions, he threatened to kill\nApplicant and his family if they walked onto the disputed property area.  Applicant contacted the\n8\nlocal sheriff several times about the threats. The sheriff told him he could not take any action against\nthe neighbor unless he drove by their homes and observed him physically assaulting the Applicant.9\nIn an attempt to minimize conflict, Applicant enclosed his property with a wooden fence.10\nLate one evening, someone on the neighbor\u2019s property threw trash over the fence into his yard. The\nnext morning, while mowing the yard, Applicant threw the trash back over the fence into his\nneighbor\u2019s yard. The neighbor then confronted him, and they began arguing.  Subsequently, the\n11\nneighbor climbed the fence, \u201changing over [Applicant\u2019s] fence into [Applicant\u2019s] yard.\u201d12\nFearing for his life, Applicant \u201cdischarged a pellet gun in the direction\u201d of the neighbor,\nhitting the fence.  He typically carried a pellet gun with him when he mowed the lawn because he\n13\nwould occasionally encounter snakes. The neighbor contacted the sheriff, who then arrested\nApplicant. Later, he was indicted, and, after appearing before a grand jury, charged with deadly\nconduct.14\nApproximately five months later, as the result of a plea bargain, Applicant was granted\ndeferred adjudication for five years, placed concurrently on supervised probation, sentenced to one\nmonth of work release, and ordered to perform 120 hours of community service.  The probation will\n15\nexpire in 2010.\nShortly after being sentenced, Applicant voluntarily enrolled in counseling that addressed, in\npart, anger management issues.  Currently, he has completed 70 hours of community service. His\n16\ntasks have included helping out at the local community civic center, working at a senior citizen\u2019s\nhome, and working with the Salvation Army.17\n\nTr. 42.\n18\nExhibit Q.\n19\nId.\n20\nExhibit Q.\n21\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n22\n4\nApplicant initially met with a probation officer once per month after the sentence. Now, he\nmeets with him once every other month.  The probation officer characterized him as a \u201cmodel\n18\nprobationer\u201d and a \u201cgood candidate for early dismissal.\u201d  He intends to recommend early dismissal\n19\nonce Applicant completes the remainder of the community service.  Moreover, he stated that he\n20\n\u201cunderstands [Applicant\u2019s] job requires a security clearance and feels he would be no threat to your\ncompany or any other company he may visit.\u201d21\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n22\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.\u201d Also, \u201c[b]y its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nHere, Applicant was arrested and charged with deadly conduct charge after he fired a pellet\ngun in the direction of his neighbor during the course of an argument. He is still serving probation\nas a result of this offense. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a), \u201ca single\nserious crime . . . ,\u201d and CC DC 31(d), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d apply.\nThis is the only time Applicant has ever been charged with a crime. He is deeply remorseful,\nhas been performing community service, as ordered, and has a good employment record. Also, he\nvoluntarily enrolled in anger management counseling. Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC\nMC) 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d apply.\nThe mitigating conditions outweigh the disqualifying conditions. Although Applicant\u2019s\nconduct resulted in a criminal charge, he was never convicted. Also, in light of the probation officer\u2019s\npositive reference, the fact that he is still serving probation is not an indication that he cannot be\ntrusted with access to classified information. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s conduct represents a serious lapse in judgment. It is mitigated by its isolated\nnature. Other than this incident, Applicant has led a stable, productive life, serving in the Air Force,\nfinishing junior college with honors while holding three jobs, and currently serving as a union\nforeman at his job. Also, the conduct is mitigated by its surrounding circumstances and Applicant\u2019s\nmotivation for the conduct. Specifically, Applicant was fearing for his life when he fired his pellet\ngun toward his neighbor. Given the neighbor\u2019s history of death threats, and the fact that he was\nclimbing over Applicant\u2019s fence when Applicant discharged the pellet gun, his fear was reasonable.\nIn addition to performing community service as ordered by the court, Applicant voluntarily\nenrolled in counseling. His parole officer characterized him as a model probationer. Applicant\u2019s\nefforts at rehabilitation also weigh in his favor.\nUpon evaluating this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude that this conduct,\nthough serious, represents an anomaly, and poses neither the risk of recurring nor any potential for\ncoercion. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 - Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Borstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns over her drug use with her history of recent\nmarijuana use since 2002 to June 2007, including use after she completed her security questionnaire\nin 2006.  While she claims no current use since July 2007 and plans to stop use if granted a security\nclearance, such a prospective promise does not sufficiently demonstrate she has mitigated concerns\nbecause of the recency of her past use and her maturity when she began use.  As the evidence of\ncurrent use and drug addiction is not established, the conditions that trigger the Smith Amendment\nhave not been proven.  However, security concerns persist over her recent drug use and her casual\nattitude towards illegal drug use.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\n\n       This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.   \n2\nto the Applicant on June 27, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make\nthe preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over illegal drug\n1\nuse (Guideline H) in paragraph 1 based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of July 23, 2007, where she\nadmitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. in paragraph 1 and denied 1.d.  She requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 7, 2007,\nwhich was forwarded to the Applicant on September 14, 2007.  Applicant was advised she had 30\ndays to respond to the FORM by submitting any objections or any additional information. Applicant\nreceived the FORM on September 18, 2007,  but sent no response to the FORM, which was due on\nOctober 18, 2007.  DOHA assigned this case to another judge on November 9, 2007, and to me on\nNovember 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 40 years old, began  work for a defense contractor as an interaction designer in\nJuly 2004 to present.  She completed an Electronic Questionnaire (SF-86) which she signed in March\n2006. (Exhibit 3)  \nApplicant received a M.S. in design from a university in May 2003. She was married in\nAugust 1993.  She has no military service.  (Exhibit 3) \nDrug Use\nApplicant admitted her illegal drug use in the last seven years in answer to Question 24 A\non the electronic security form.  She admitted using marijuana from December 2002 to December\n2005.  (Exhibit 3)  However, when questioned in an interrogatory in June 2007, she admitted she\ndisclosed additional use in a security interview in December 2006 where she admitted she first began\nsmoking marijuana with her husband in December 2002.  She estimated her use as five times a year,\nand she stated she used marijuana 25 times between December 2002 and December 2005.  Since she\ncompleted her SF-86 security form she smoked marijuana an additional three or four times from\nMarch 2006 to November 2006.  Despite her maturity in age, she expressed a casual attitude towards\nillegal drug use as she compared her use of marijuana to that of a person who has a glass of wine\nwith dinner once per month.  She would stop using marijuana if she was confronted at work about\nher use or if her company randomly tested employees for drug use.  When asked to confirm the\naccuracy of the Report of Investigation (ROI) of the Personal Subject Interview, Applicant did not\ndispute any of the information in the report but provided supplemental information to provide the\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n2\n3\ncontext for her use and to clarify that the marijuana use \u201cwas/and is strictly recreational in nature.\u201d\nHer husband purchases the marijuana for their mutual use.  (Exhibit 4) \nIn response to the SOR she admitted marijuana use to June 2007.  (SOR 1.a.)  She also\nadmitted she continued drug use after she had completed her security clearance application until June\n2007.  (SOR 1.b.)   Finally, she acknowledged she previously stated she would stop using marijuana\nonly if she was confronted at work about her drug use or if her company randomly tested employees\nfor drug use.  (SOR 1.c.)   \nIn July 2007 she denied she was currently using unlawful drugs, but stated she only stopped\ndrug use in July 2007 because of her concern over her company\u2019s needs for her to have a security\nclearance.  She denied she was ever addicted to marijuana use or diagnosed with drug dependence\nby a medical professional.  She pledged not to use marijuana if she is granted a security clearance.\n(Answer, Exhibit 2) (SOR 1.d.)  She provided no evidence of good character from her community\nor work place.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  The guidelines  are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether  to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or\nabsence of any adjudication policy condition is not decisive. \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. \nIn reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, an administrative\njudge may draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the\nevidence of record.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security\nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination\nas to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d   A decision to deny a security clearance does not\n2\ndetermine allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism, rather it concludes the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense established to issue a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H: Drug Use\n\n4\n24.  The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe government established security concerns under drug use disqualifying conditions as\ndetailed in  \u00b6 25.(a), any drug abuse (Drugs listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended, e.g. marijuana or cannabis).  Applicant admitted that use of illegal drugs can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability.  Nevertheless, she continued her\ninfrequent marijuana use from 2002 to June 2007.  Thus, under 25.(h) both in her interview in 2006\nand in her interrogatories in June 2007, she indicated  her \u201cintent to continue illegal drug use.\u201d Even\nin July 2007 in her answer she failed to \u201cclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d\nHer only reason for her recent decision to discontinue her marijuana use was because of her\ncompany\u2019s needs for her to have a security clearance.  She continued to express a casual attitude\ntowards illegal drug use as she personally believes such drug use is similar to having a glass of wine.\nShe did not acknowledge the difference between illegal drug use and legal alcohol use.  \nHowever, the government failed to establish security concerns under SOR 1.d. under 10\nU.S.C. 986 as there was no evidence that she continues to be an unlawful user of, or was addicted\nto, a controlled substance as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.\n802).  \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. It is possible to mitigate\nsecurity concerns under this guideline:  \u00b626. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns\ninclude: \u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Her recent use to June 2007 does not meet this test.\nApplicant only took steps on the path to remain drug free in July 2007.  This recent statement of\nintent does not yet meet the test under MC \u00b626.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in\nthe future, scuh as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. \nOne cannot yet conclude with certainty that her illegal drug use is unlikely to recur as she is\nstill married to her husband with whom she used marijuana, she has not changed the environment\nwhere she used drugs, and neither has there been an \u201cappropriate\u201d period of abstinence.  While the\nterm \u201cappropriate\u201d is ambiguous, a commitment of very short duration since July 2007 clearly cannot\nmeet the appropriate test.  While she claims an intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, such a\npromise does not meet the technical requirements of MC \u00b6 26.(b)(4).  Thus, doubt does persist over\nher reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  While she asks for consideration for her honesty\nand candor, her persistence in continuing her drug use even after she was alerted to security concerns\nover drug use shows poor judgment in a person with her maturity and education.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\n5\nIn evaluating her under the \u201cwhole person\u201d standard, I note she provided no supplemental\ninformation on her employment record or community involvement, nor did she provide any character\nreference letters.  However, she is a highly educated women with a master\u2019s degree and of an age\nwhere she can be held responsible for her decisions to engage in illegal drug use on a repeated basis\nfrom 2002 to 2007 and continued her illegal drug use during the period that she was seeking a\nsecurity clearance.  She continues her ties to her husband with whom she used drugs.  \nConsequently, after looking at her as a whole person and considering the Adjudicative\nProcess factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b.,\nand 1.c., but for Applicant on subparagraph 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

From approximately 1980 to 1983, her father was employed in an official\ncapacity by the government of the PRC.  After becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001, Applicant traveled\nto the PRC twice in 2002 and once in 2004.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\n1\nmodified.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\n  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On June 14, 2007, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense (DoD) Directive (Directive),  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the\n2\nbasis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline B (Foreign Influence),\npromulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs issued as of\nSeptember 1, 2006, and thereafter.   With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the\n3\nDirective and the applicable Guidelines.  Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, and it was\nreceived by DoD on July 5, 2007.  In her answer, Applicant requested that her case be determined on\nthe record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nAugust 23, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  By letter dated\nAugust 27, 2007, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any\nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on\nAugust 30, 2007.  She timely filed additional information within the required time period.  Department\nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s additional filing.  On September 26, 2007, the\ncase was assigned to me for a decision.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under revised adjudicative\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., Item 1.)  Applicant admitted all three\nallegations.  (Item 4.)  Her admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a software engineer and web\ndeveloper.  She was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and became a U.S. citizen in 2001.\nApplicant\u2019s husband was also born in the PRC and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.  The couple was\nmarried in the PRC in 1983.  In June 1999, Applicant earned a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university.\n(Item 6; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.)  \nApplicant was raised by her grandparents in the northeastern part of the PRC until she was 14\nyears old.  The record indicates she resided with her parents until finishing high school.  She attended\ncollege in the PRC and visited her parents and family members during school vacations and on\nholidays.  Seventeen years ago, when she was approximately 33 years old, she immigrated to the U.S.\nfrom the PRC.  Applicant asserts she does not have a close relationship with her parents, who are\ncitizens and residents of the PRC.  She also asserts her two siblings, who are citizens and residents of\nthe PRC, work for private companies and have no relationships with the government of the PRC.\n(Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; Item 6.)\nFrom approximately 1980 to 1983, Applicant\u2019s father was employed as an official by the\n\nU.S. Department of State, Background Note: China, dated August 2007 (Background Note on China) at 1-2,\n4\n14-16, 17-22.)\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook  [Unclassified/For Official Use Only], dated\n5\nJune 2004, (Intelligence Threat Handbook), at 17.\nU.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2006 Report to Congress of the U.S. - China\n6\nEconomic and Security Review Commission, dated November 2006, at 138.\n3\ngovernment of the PRC.  He has been retired for approximately 25 years.  (Item 4; Item 5 at 3;\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.)\nIn 2002, Applicant traveled to the PRC to attend her grandmother\u2019s funeral.  She traveled again\nto the PRC in 2002 to visit her father, who had suffered a heart attack.  In 2004, she traveled to the\nPRC for her father\u2019s 80th birthday celebration.  Applicant telephones her family members in the PRC\napproximately every one or two months.  (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM; Item 5.) \nApplicant is highly respected by her employer, who rated her job performance from June 2005\nto May 2006 as \u201cOutstanding\u201d in most categories.  (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.)\nWith the SOR, the Government provided seven official U.S. publications describing the\neconomic, political and intelligence activities of the PRC.  The Government also provided these\ndocuments to Applicant and requested that the administrative judge admit the documents to the record\nin this case and take administrative notice of specific facts within those documents. I have admitted\nthe proffered official documents to the record, and I take administrative notice of the following facts\nfound therein:\nThe PRC, which has a population of over one billion people, is ruled by an authoritarian\ngovernment dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.  The U.S. and the PRC disagree on the status\nof Taiwan, and the PRC continues to resist what it considers to be superpower dominance by the\nUnited States.4\nThe Intelligence Threat Handbook identifies PRC intelligence activities toward the United\nStates as follows: \u201cThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China because of the U.S. role\nas a global superpower; its substantial military, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim\nand Asia; its role as a developer of advanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and\nthe large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by\nthe PRC.\u201d5\nThe U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission identified between 2,000 and\n3,00 Chinese front companies operating in the United States to gather secret or proprietary\ninformation.  Additionally, the PRC \u201coften requests or requires its citizens who are studying or\nworking in places where they have access to cutting-edge research activities or to technology\ndevelopment and application to obtain whatever information about those activities they can obtain and\nprovide the information to the Chinese government.\u201d6\nThe Commission Report also made this key finding: \u201cChina makes a concerted effort to\nmodernize its military by obtaining military-related systems and technologies from other countries,\n\nId. at 139.\n7\nDC 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\n8\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\n DC 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict\n9\nof interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d\n4\nparticularly Russia.  China used legal and illegal means, including espionage, to obtain such\ntechnologies from the United States.\u201d7\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Foreign Influence Guideline identifies the following security concern: Foreign contacts\nand interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should  consider the identity of the foreign country in which\nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations\nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nThis case requires the recognition that the PRC is a totalitarian government that actively targets\nU.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry to request or require that they obtain information about cutting-edge\nresearch activities or technology development and provide that information to the Chinese government.\nMoreover, the Chinese government uses legal and illegal means, including espionage, to obtain\ninformation on technology development from the United States.\nApplicant admitted the three Guideline B allegations in the SOR.  The facts in this case raise\npossible security concerns under three Guideline B disqualifying conditions.  Applicant has contacts\nwith four family members who are residents and citizens of the PRC, a country that is known to\nexploit, pressure, or coerce U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry to provide secret or proprietary\ninformation to the PRC government. Her father, now retired, held an official position with the PRC\ngovernment.  These facts raise concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a) of Guideline B.8\nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, sister and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Because\nthe PRC is a totalitarian state with many political and security interests antithetical to the U.S., these\nfacts raise security concerns under DC 7(b) of Guideline B.    \n9\nSince becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001, Applicant traveled to the PRC three times: twice in\n2002 and once in 2004.  Even though her travels to the PRC were for the purpose of visiting family\nmembers, her presence in the PRC made her and her family members potentially vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by the PRC government, which actively seeks to obtain classified\n\nDC 7(i) reads: \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable\n10\nto exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign group, government, or country.\u201d\n5\nor proprietary information from U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry who work for U.S. government\ncontractors.  These facts raise concerns under DC 7(i) of Guideline B.  \n10\nThere are several Mitigating Conditions (MC) that potentially apply to the disqualifying\nconditions raised by the facts in this case.  Applicant could mitigate Guideline B security concerns if\nshe could credibly demonstrate that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  MC\n8(a).  She could also mitigate Guideline B security concerns if the facts credibly show there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest  (MC 8(b)); or contact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation (MC 8(c)); or the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority (MC 8(d)). \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts with her family members in the PRC and her travel to the PRC\nwere not the result of U.S. government business, and nothing in the record suggests they were\napproved by a cognizant security authority.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with her parents and siblings in the\nPRC are frequent, on-going, and familial.  Her relationship with them is one of loyalty and obligation,\nraising the concern that these relationships create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nApplicant failed to rebut a potentially disqualifying security concern by providing credible evidence\nthat it is unlikely she would placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.  She also failed to rebut the potentially disqualifying security\nconcern by providing credible evidence that she was not vulnerable to a conflict of interest because\nof her sense of loyalty to her family members in the PRC was minimal and she could be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  Accordingly, I conclude that MCs 8(a),\n8(b), 8(c), and 8(d) are inapplicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process, as defined at E2.2. of the Directive, is \u201cthe careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables known as the whole person concept\u201d and further requires the consideration of\nreliable information, favorable and unfavorable, about a person\u2019s past and present conduct.  The\nfollowing factors should be considered in evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct under\nthe whole person concept: \u201cthe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation;\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for\nthe conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d (See Directive, E2.2.1.1. to E2.2.1.9.) \n\n6\nApplicant is 50 years old and has resided in the U.S. for approximately 17 years.  In 1999, she\nearned a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university.  She became a U.S. citizen in 2001.  The record is\nsilent regarding the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s education, work experience and social and\nbusiness contacts in the PRC from the time of her graduation from high school to her emigration at\nthe approximate age of 33 years.\nApplicant is a valued employee of a U.S. government contractor.  She is also an honorable\nfamily member who seeks to maintain contact with her parents and siblings who are citizens and\nresidents of the PRC.  In carrying out her family responsibilities, she has made choices to travel to the\nPRC, and these choices could also make her vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could\ncause the future compromise of classified information.  I have carefully reviewed the administrative\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR.  I have weighed the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions of Guideline B, and I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at \u00b6 E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  After doing so, I conclude\nallegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR against Applicant.\nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR or in the\nadministrative record suggested she was not a loyal American citizen.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Therefore, nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance\nis denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On October 17, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\n\n1Tr. pp. 26, 30-31, 42, 45-46, 60-61, 72.\n2This incident is the subject of SOR paragraph 1.k, which alleged: \u201cOn or about April 15, 2000, you were\narrested and charged with Assault-Intent/Reckless/Injure and Criminal Damage-Deface.\u201d\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 5, 2009 after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert Robinson\nGales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether he was wrongfully prejudiced\nby a perception that he wasn\u2019t honest about his past; (2) whether the Judge made inaccurate findings\nof fact regarding some of the circumstances surrounding his criminal history; and (3) whether the\nJudge was biased.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant had a history of drug involvement which\ncommenced in 1997 and continued repeatedly until at least 2005 with few significant breaks\nbetween incidents.  The Judge found that Applicant was involved in multiple incidents of purchase,\npossession, and use of drugs and drug paraphernalia.  In deciding that the case against Applicant had\nnot been mitigated, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not established a meaningful track\nrecord of drug abstinence or steadfast compliance with the law. \nApplicant states that \u201c[w]e are here today because the prosecution feels that I wasn\u2019t honest\non the SOR that I received some time in November of 2008.\u201d  Although this argument is not\ncompletely clear, Applicant appears to be arguing that, contrary to the evidence, Department\nCounsel claimed that Applicant was being less then candid when discussing the allegations\ncontained in the SOR.  This interpretation of Applicant\u2019s assertion is borne out by portions of the\nline of questioning  of Applicant by Department Counsel during the hearing below.1\nAbsent actions that raise the issue of a denial of due process, the manner in which\nDepartment Counsel develops the government\u2019s case is not usually a relevant inquiry on appeal.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s mere contention that Applicant was dishonest does not establish that the\nJudge erred.  To the extent Applicant is asserting that the Judge committed harmful error by relying\non Department Counsel\u2019s claim of Applicant\u2019s dishonesty for his unfavorable security clearance\ndecision, Applicant has failed to establish error.  First, there are no SOR allegations in this case\ndealing with Applicant\u2019s lack of honesty.  Second, while the Judge does discuss his perception that\nApplicant gave vague and inconsistent answers to questions about his past drug and criminal history\nand that this affected his assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, he did so for the limited purpose of\ndetermining the applicability of two of the Guideline J mitigating conditions.  Credibility\ndeterminations of Judges resulting from hearing testimony are entitled to deference on appeal.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has failed to carry his burden of establishing that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings and conclusions on this point are erroneous.\nApplicant states that the Judge used evidence of a specific incident in the record2 along with\n\u201ca slew of other questionable charges\u201d to form a basis for deciding against him in the case.\n\nRegarding the cited incident, Applicant does little more than offer his version of events.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case\nNo. 08-00969 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2009).  \nApplicant indicates that he feels that it was impossible for the Judge to make a fair decision\nregarding his case, because, after the hearing, he witnessed the Judge and the Department Counsel\nwalk down the street together and enter a nearby restaurant for lunch.  Applicant asserts that this\ncontact was inappropriate, and that because of the contact, the Judge could be coerced into making\na decision. \nAccepting Applicant\u2019s description of the contact as true, solely for purposes of deciding the\nappeal, Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge and Department Counsel walked to a restaurant together\nand had lunch is insufficient to raise a colorable claim of bias or improper conduct.  Even if the facts\nare as Applicant indicates, one cannot reasonably infer that the Judge and Department Counsel\ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s case.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-\n06039 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2008).  Furthermore, there is a rebuttable presumption that agency\nofficials carry out their duties in good faith, and a person seeking to rebut or overcome that\npresumption has the burden of presenting clear evidence to the contrary.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n17609 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)(citing National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish,\n541 U.S. 157, 174 (2004); reh\u2019g denied, 541 U.S. 1057 (2004)).  Applicant\u2019s speculation about the\nJudge and Department Counsel lacks sufficient substance to raise a colorable claim about the good\nfaith of the Judge and Department Counsel.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09220 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep.\n28, 2004)(Applicant\u2019s claim that the Judge and Department Counsel arrived at the hearing location\ntogether and left that location together was insufficient to raise a colorable claim of lack of good\nfaith or bias).  Applicant has not demonstrated error.\n  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Board is also satisfied that Applicant\u2019s procedural rights under the\nDirective were adhered to.  The Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination is\nsustainable.\nOrder\n\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant had a history of drug involvement which commenced in 1997 and continued repeatedly until at least 2005 with few significant breaks between incidents. The Judge found that Applicant was involved in multiple incidents of purchase, possession, and use of drugs and drug paraphernalia. In deciding that the case against Applicant had not been mitigated, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not established a meaningful track record of drug abstinence or steadfast compliance with the law. Applicant states that \u201c[w]e are here today because the prosecution feels that I wasn\u2019t honest on the SOR that I received some time in November of 2008.\u201d Although this argument is not completely clear, Applicant appears to be arguing that, contrary to the evidence, Department Counsel claimed that Applicant was being less then candid when discussing the allegations contained in the SOR. This interpretation of Applicant\u2019s assertion is borne out by portions of the line of questioning of Applicant by Department Counsel during the hearing below.1 Absent actions that raise the issue of a denial of due process, the manner in which Department Counsel develops the government\u2019s case is not usually a relevant inquiry on appeal. Department Counsel\u2019s mere contention that Applicant was dishonest does not establish that the Judge erred. To the extent Applicant is asserting that the Judge committed harmful error by relying on Department Counsel\u2019s claim of Applicant\u2019s dishonesty for his unfavorable security clearance decision, Applicant has failed to establish error. First, there are no SOR allegations in this case dealing with Applicant\u2019s lack of honesty. Second, while the Judge does discuss his perception that Applicant gave vague and inconsistent answers to questions about his past drug and criminal history and that this affected his assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, he did so for the limited purpose of determining the applicability of two of the Guideline J mitigating conditions. Credibility determinations of Judges resulting from hearing testimony are entitled to deference on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant has failed to carry his burden of establishing that the Judge\u2019s findings and",

Eligibility to occupy an Information Systems Position \ndesignated ADP I/II/III (public trust position) is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 3, 2006,1 Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P). On October 17, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified \n(Regulation); Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified \n(Directive); a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense \n(Counterintelligence and Security), Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated \n \n1 Applicant erroneously dated the SF 85P as January 3, 2005, but he corrected the date when he reaffirmed \nit on February 7, 2006. Tr. at 119-120. \nJune 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nNovember 19, 2004; and a memorandum from the Deputy Director for Personnel \nSecurity, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, \nCommunications, and Intelligence (C\u00b3I), AIS Trustworthiness Determinations: Request \nfor Adjudicative Assistance, dated August 4, 1999. \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct), H (Drug Involvement), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \noccupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III to support a contract \nwith the Department of Defense, and recommended referral to an administrative judge \nto determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and the Regulation in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, \n2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. However, in a sworn, written \nstatement, dated November 14, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and the case was assigned \nto me on February 6, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 5, 2009, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 26, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, 10 Government exhibits and no Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on April 3, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAt the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s case, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR to conform to the evidence presented.  Specifically, she moved to correct certain \nalleged facts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.f., and withdraw SOR & 3.a. There being no \nobjection, the motion was granted.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the following factual allegations \npertaining to Criminal Conduct in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1e., 1.g., and 1.j.; and the following \n \n2 Id. at 93, 96, 106-109, 118. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nfactual allegations pertaining to Drug Involvement in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 2.c. and 2.d.). He \ndenied the remaining allegations, including the factual allegation pertaining to Personal \nConduct. During the hearing, he admitted the following amended factual allegations \npertaining to Criminal Conduct (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.f. \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain his eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III \nto support a contract with the Department of Defense. He has been gainfully employed \nby the same defense contractor since December 2005, and currently serves as a \npharmaceutical customer telephone supervisor.3 His employment history since 1998 \nincludes a variety of positions with different employers, generally as a field technician or \ncustomer service representative.

He commenced using marijuana in about 1997, when he was 17 \nyears old, with a friend, while in high school,9 and continued using it, with some periods \nof abstinence, until March 7, 2005.10 Initially, he used marijuana between one and three \ntimes a week while \u201changing out\u201d with friends.11 Marijuana relaxed him.12 He also \nexperimented on one occasion with the hallucinogen phencyclidine (PCP), but \ncontended he was not aware the cigarette had been dipped in PCP.13 While attending \ncollege for three years, until he graduated in October 2001, he continued to smoke two \n \n3 Id. at 23. \n \n4 Id. at 5, 22. \n \n5 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 85P, dated January 3, 2006), at 6. \n \n6 Tr. at 21-22. \n \n7 Id. at 22. \n \n8 Id.  \n \n9 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant Affidavit, dated April 24, 2008), at 9.

Some of those \nincidents involved marijuana, and others did not. The SOR alleges 11 incidents, as \nfollows: \n \nSOR & 1.k.: On April 15, 2000, when he was 19 years old, Applicant and his live-\nin girl friend, the mother of his oldest child, got into an argument during which he struck \nher in the jaw and chest, and kicked her in the stomach while she was lying on the \nfloor.23 He also kicked out her front window.24  He was arrested and charged with one \ncount of assault-intent/reckless/injure and one count of criminal damage-deface.25 It \n \n14 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 9. But see Id. at 25, wherein he contends he used marijuana \nmaybe \u201conce or twice a week.\u201d \n \n15 Applicant seemingly has confused dates during his testimony. His benchmark for abstaining commenced \nwith his relocation into his mother\u2019s residence in June 2002, not 2003, as stated in his affidavit, and he moved out in \nJune 2004, not 2005, as stated in his affidavit.

Applicant became abusive and was ordered by \nthe manager to leave the store, but as he was leaving, Applicant threatened the \nmanager by stating \u201cI\u2019ll blow this m----- f------ store up bitch.\u201d The police happened to be \npassing by at the time and intervened. Applicant remained belligerent and \nuncooperative, despite having a police officer\u2019s gun pointed at him. Applicant was \nplaced into custody for disorderly conduct, and a search of him, incident to arrest, \nrevealed a clear plastic baggy containing 1.2 grams of marijuana.27 He was charged \nwith one count of possession of marijuana, one count of criminal trespassing 3rd degree, \none count of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of disorderly conduct \n(abusive/offensive language).28 Applicant pled guilty to the marijuana charge and was \nsentenced to a fine and two years probation, along with a requirement that he complete \ndrug counseling.29 The drug paraphernalia charge was dismissed, and no complaints \nwere filed for the remaining charges.30 During the hearing, Applicant denied ever \nthreatening to blow up the store, but his threat was overheard by both the store \nmanager and the police officer. Furthermore, he denied to the police that the marijuana \nwas his. \n \nSOR & 1.i.: On January 1, 2001, at about 12 a.m., Applicant was driving his \nvehicle when he made an unsafe lane change in front of a police car. The police officer \nstopped Applicant and, upon approaching the vehicle, detected the odor of marijuana \nemanating from it. Applicant was taken into custody and the officer\u2019s police dog, a \nspecialist in detecting certain drugs, \u201csniffed\u201d Applicant\u2019s vehicle. He alerted on the \ndriver\u2019s side door in which a marijuana pipe was located. Further hand search by the \nofficer discovered a useable quantity of what was field-tested and found to be \nmarijuana.31 He was charged with one count of possession of marijuana, and one count \nof possession of drug paraphernalia.32 Applicant does not recall if he was ever \nconvicted of the charges.33  \n \n26 Id. \n \n27 Government Exhibit 9 (Police Department Report, dated July 2, 2000) at 1,3, 5-6, 9. \n \n28 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 3. \n \n29 Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR, dated November 14, 2008, at 2. \n \n30 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 3. \n \n31 Government Exhibit 8 (Sheriff\u2019s Incident Report, dated January 1, 2001) at 2. \n \n32 Id. \n \n33 Tr. at 77-78. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nd.  \n                                                          \nSOR & 1.h.: On February 24, 2001, Applicant and his former girlfriend were \npicking up their daughter at someone\u2019s residence when they got into an argument. The \nformer girlfriend was standing outside the vehicle with Applicant sitting in the driver\u2019s \nseat. She reached into the vehicle to retrieve her keys when he pushed her hand \nagainst the door. She retaliated by biting his hand. They were both taken into custody \nfor assault and domestic violence. A search of Applicant, incident to arrest, revealed a \npackage of cigarette rolling papers commonly used to smoke marijuana, and a search \nof the vehicle revealed a clear plastic baggie containing an unspecified amount of \nusable marijuana.34 Applicant denied the marijuana was his. He was charged with one \ncount of possession of marijuana, one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, and \none count of assault.35 The assault charge was dismissed,36 but it is unclear as to what \nthe disposition was for the marijuana-related charges. Applicant has offered two \ndiffering results of the incident. In his affidavit of April 2008, he believed the charges \nwere dropped,37 but during the hearing, he recalled being sentenced to probation for the \nmarijuana-related charges.38   \n \nSOR & 1.g.: On October 19, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with one \ncount of failure to appear 1st degree.39 No complaint was filed.40 Applicant does not \nrecall if he was ever convicted of the charge,41 and there is no evidence to indicate that \nhe was. \n \nSOR & 1.f.: On October 24, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nfailure to appear in relation to the marijuana-related offenses of January 1, 2001.42  The \npossession of marijuana charge was amended to marijuana violation, and he was found \nguilty of the amended charge and sentenced to 60 days in jail, a fine, and 3 years \nprobation, with a discharge date of March 13, 2003.43 The charge for possession of \ndrug paraphernalia was dismisse\n44\n \n \n34 Government Exhibit 7 (Police Incident Report, dated February 24, 2001) at 1-2. \n \n35 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 4. \n \n36 Id. \n \n37 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 3. \n \n38 Tr. at 79. \n \n39 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 4. \n \n40 Id. \n \n41 Tr. at 80. \n \n42 Id. at 110. \n \n43 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 4. \n \n \n44 Id. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nSOR & 1.e.: On May 5, 2002, at about 12:30 a.m., Applicant and some friends \nwere parked in adjacent vehicles listening to loud music while smoking. They were \ninitially approached by a police officer because of the noise. However, because of the \nstrong odor of marijuana coming from both vehicles, the officer asked Applicant and the \nother vehicle owner for consent to search both vehicles. Consent was given. The search \nof Applicant\u2019s vehicle uncovered a hand rolled cigar containing over 1 gram of \nmarijuana in brown rolling paper in a cardboard box on the front passenger seat and a \nsmall plastic bag containing 1.49 grams of marijuana in the center console.  Applicant \nacknowledged the marijuana was his, but stated the cigar belonged to a friend. He also \nadmitted he was currently on probation for marijuana. He was arrested and charged \nwith one count of possession of marijuana and one count of possession of drug \nparaphernalia, both felonies.45 Applicant apparently failed to appear for his required \ncourt date, and it was not until his arrest on March 5, 2005, on charges set forth below, \nthat it was discovered there was an active warrant for his arrest. He was subsequently \nfound guilty of the possession of marijuana charge, a felony, and sentenced to \nsupervised probation for 3 years, beginning March 3, 2006, a fine, and required to \nundergo drug and alcohol testing.46  \n \nSOR & 1.d.: On March 7, 2005, at approximately 11:00 p.m., police responded to \ncomplaints about loud noise and a disturbance coming from an apartment. Applicant \nand his friends were drinking and smoking marijuana.47 When the police arrived, they \nlooked through the window and observed one of the occupants sitting at a table, \npackaging what appeared to be marijuana. There were two plastic bags containing \nmarijuana inside an unzipped canvass duffel bag on the table. Although Applicant \ndenied the bag was his, he acknowledged the bag contained some of his \u201cimportant \npapers.\u201d In fact, the canvass duffel bag contained five plastic bags filled with marijuana, \na pipe with residue, two scales for measuring ounces, a notebook, and miscellaneous \npapers with Applicant\u2019s name appearing on them. Subsequent analysis determined the \nplastic bags contained 89.1 grams of marijuana, and marijuana residue in the pipe.48 \nApplicant was arrested and charged with two counts of possession of marijuana and \none count of possession of drug paraphernalia, all felonies.49 The police also \ndiscovered there was an active warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest.50 Applicant has offered \ntwo differing results of the incident. In his affidavit of April 2008, he believed the charges \n \n45 Government Exhibit 6 (Police Offense/Incident Report, dated May 5, 2002) at 3-4, 7. \n \n46 Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR, supra note 29, at 2. \n \n47 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 5. \n \n48 Government Exhibit 5 (Police Offense/Incident Report, dated March 8, 2005) at 2-4, 10. \n \n49 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 5. \n \n50 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 47, at 2-3. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nwere dropped,51 but during the hearing, he recalled pleading guilty but did not recall the \nsentence.52  \n \nSOR & 1.c.: Applicant obtained a position in telemarketing and chose to be paid \nan hourly wage as opposed to a commission. Two weeks later, when he went to pick up \nhis paycheck, a dispute arose and he was advised by his employer that since he had \nselected the commission option he had no paycheck coming. In retaliation, upon \ndeparting, Applicant took a television from his supervisor\u2019s desk and went home. He \nnever returned to work, and never returned the television because he considered it \ncompensation for his work.53 On June 7, 2005, Applicant was charged with theft-control \nprop. On August 27, 2005, he was arrested for the charge,54 in addition to another \ncharge, specified below. He subsequently pled guilty and a $500 fine was imposed.55 \n \nSOR & 1.b.: On August 27, 2005, as noted above, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with failure to appear in relation to the theft-related offense of June 5, 2005, \nreferred to above.56   \n \nSOR & 1.a.: On November 18, 2005, Applicant was arrested on outstanding \nbench warrants related to the marijuana-related offenses of May 2002 and March 2005, \nas well as a non SOR-alleged marijuana-related offense of March 2003.57 It appears \nthat there were three counts of marijuana violation and one count of drug paraphernalia \nviolation involved.58 As noted above, Applicant was subsequently found guilty of the \npossession of a marijuana charge, a felony, and sentenced to supervised probation for \n3 years, beginning March 3, 2006, a $2,500 to $3,000 fine, and required to undergo \ndrug and alcohol testing.59 Applicant\u2019s period of probation ended in March 2009, only \nweeks before the hearing, but approximately five months after the SOR was issued. \n \nAs part of his court-mandates, Applicant underwent probation with group drug \ncounseling and classes, on two separate occasions (2001-02 and 2005) but was never \nevaluated or diagnosed as a drug abuser or drug dependent.60 Initially, he did not \n \n51 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 6. \n \n52 Tr. at 81. \n \n53 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 6-7; Tr. at 82-83. \n \n54 Government Exhibit 4 (Arrest/Booking Record, dated August 27, 2005) at 1-2. \n \n55 Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR, supra note 29, at 1. \n \n56 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 54. \n \n57 Tr. at 109. \n \n58 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 23, at 5. \n \n59 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 9, at 8. \n \n60 Tr. at 34, 83-84. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nappreciate those sessions and did not believe they were very helpful. However, in \nretrospect, after the second set of 20-30 sessions, he believes they were.61 Despite \ntaking that counseling and those classes, what he had learned did not have a lasting \neffect on him, and he continued using marijuana after he had completed them.62 \nBetween 2001 and 2003, he tested positive for marijuana on two occasions, neither of \nwhich were during a period of probation.63 As a result of his use of PCP, Applicant \nbecame incoherent and out of control, resulting in his being hospitalized at a drug and \nalcohol treatment facility for three or four days.64  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony during the hearing was replete with \u201cI do not recall\u201d \nresponses to inquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the dispositions of \nthose arrests, and whether or not he had used marijuana prior to the individual \nincidents.  Likewise, when questioned pertaining to a particular incident, he sometimes \nresponded by referring to other incidents.  He referred to incidents with the wrong dates \nand frequently revised his testimony.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d65 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access \nto such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive \npositions.\u201d66 \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is \nthat, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d67 Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any \nfinal unfavorable access determination may be made.68  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d69 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.70  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation.  Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public \ntrust determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.71 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n69 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro.

Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n71 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:       \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns. In addition, if the \u201cindividual is currently on \nparole or probation,\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) may apply. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of criminal \nconduct, involving about 11 arrests and a substantial number of convictions (along with \na number of dismissals), is documented in his police records, his affidavit, and the \nevidence, including his testimony, presented during the hearing. The Government has \nestablished AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).  Applicant was on court-imposed probation from \nMarch 3, 2006, until some unspecified date in March 2009. While he was no longer on \nprobation at the time of the hearing, when the SOR was issued, he was still on \nprobation. AG \u00b6 31(d) was established, but is no longer applicable. \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 32(d) may apply when \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.@  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32 (d) are similar and only partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of criminal conduct involving the police, as set forth in the SOR, commenced in \nApril 2000, when he was 19 years old, but in actuality, it commenced several years \nearlier, in 1997, when he was 17 years old, and using marijuana. His criminal conduct \ncontinued repeatedly until 2005 with few significant breaks between incidents. Criminal \nconduct, sometimes only months apart from each other, occurred largely because of \nApplicant\u2019s apparent disinterest and attitude towards authority and regulations, including \nthe law. His multiple incidents of criminal conduct included possession and use of drugs \nand drug paraphernalia, assaults, theft, and failure to appear in court. Over an extensive \nperiod, arrests and judicial punishment failed to stem the tide of his criminal activities. \nInstead, he was emboldened by some relatively light fines, brief periods of confinement, \nprobation, and mandated counseling, as well as some dismissals of charges. His \nmisconduct continued unabated, until at least 2005. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nThe circumstances of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct were not so unusual that they \nwould be unlikely to recur. To the contrary, the circumstances cast substantial doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Furthermore, Applicant \nwas unable or unwilling to explain or describe the circumstances of various incidents, \nand as noted above, his testimony was replete with \u201cI do not recall\u201d responses to \ninquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the dispositions of those arrests, \nand whether or not he had used marijuana prior to the individual incidents.  Likewise, \nwhen questioned pertaining to a particular incident, he sometimes responded by \nreferring to other incidents.  He referred to incidents with the wrong dates and frequently \nrevised his testimony.  All of the above seriously eroded his credibility. \n \nApplicant has argued that sufficient time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \noccurred to support mitigation of such conduct. He contends the last incident occurred \nin June 2005 (theft); he ignores the arrest in August 2005 (failure to appear); and \ncontends that the November 2005 arrest was merely the culmination of earlier criminal \nconduct. That arrest resulted, in part, in Applicant being sentenced to supervised \nprobation for 3 years, beginning March 3, 2006. Applicant\u2019s period of probation ended in \nMarch 2009, only weeks before the hearing, but approximately five months after the \nSOR was issued. He served his sentence, paid his fine, and completed his court-\nmandated counseling. Other than the absence of any more recent SOR-alleged criminal \nconduct, and the completion of probation and court-mandated counseling, there is \ninsufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. \n \nWhile a person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the \npast, without a clear indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, I am \nunable to determine with reasonable certainty the probability that such conduct will not \nrecur in the future. As noted above, Applicant is a repeat criminal, having been arrested \nand convicted numerous times, repeatedly punished, and on two separate occasions, \nplaced on probation. There were periods when he abstained from criminal conduct, only \nto eventually return to it. Considering the six year period of SOR-alleged criminal \nconduct, the three and one-half years since his last SOR-alleged arrest, and the two \nmonths since he completed his probation stemming from that conviction, I believe the \ntime elapsed does not yet satisfy the full intent of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32 (d). \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drugs is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of \n1970,72 \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, \u201ctesting positive for \nillegal drug use,\u201d may apply under AG \u00b6 25(b). In addition, when there is evidence of \n\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c) may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant has admitted the use and purchase of marijuana, and \nacknowledged his two positive tests for marijuana. He repeatedly possessed drug \nparaphernalia. There is eyewitness police evidence of his involvement in packaging \nmarijuana. He was arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal charges on several \ndifferent occasions between 2000 and 2005. The Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(b), and 25(c). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \nWhen there is \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d AG \n\u00b6 26(b) may apply. In addition, AG \u00b6 26(d) may apply when there is \u201csatisfactory \ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(d) are very similar to AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32 (d), discussed \nabove, and only partially apply. Concerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules \nfor determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the \ndirective.\u201d73 For example, if the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed \n \n72 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 \nU.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n \n73 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d74  \n \n Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement, as set forth in the SOR, commenced in \n1997, when he was about 17 years old, and continued repeatedly at least until 2005 \nwith few significant breaks between incidents. His drug involvement \u2013 multiple incidents \nof purchase, possession, and use of drugs, and drug paraphernalia, and failure to \nappear in court pertaining to the various charges against him \u2013 occurred sometimes \nonly months apart from each other. It reflected Applicant\u2019s apparent disinterest and \nattitude towards authority and regulations, including the law. Over that period, arrests \nand judicial punishment failed to stem the tide of his drug involvement. Instead, he was \nemboldened by some relatively light fines, brief periods of confinement, probations, and \nmandated counseling, as well as some dismissals of charges. His drug involvement \ncontinued unabated, until 2005.  \n \nThere were periods during which Applicant abstained from any drug use, but \nthose periods of abstinence ended when he resumed the drug use. There were two \nperiods of court-ordered probation, with the earlier one followed by Applicant\u2019s \nresumption of drug use. There were court-mandated group therapy sessions followed \nby his resumption of drug use. It is significant that in March 2005, Applicant and his \nassociates were observed by police packaging 89.1 grams of marijuana, and his papers \nand a scale were found in a duffle bag, leading one to surmise that dealing or selling of \nmarijuana might have been intended. However, that specific allegation does not appear \nin the SOR and was not charged. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement occurred under three general circumstances or \nenvironments: high school, college, and post-college. Each period involved different \ndrug-using associates and contacts, yet they all had two things in common: they were \nApplicant\u2019s friends and associates and they, as well as Applicant, used drugs. Changing \nthe circumstances, environments, geographical locations, or friends and associates, \nmade no difference, for he continued using drugs. Abstinence was followed by drug \nuse. Counseling was followed by drug use. Arrest and punishment was followed by drug \nuse. The circumstances of Applicant\u2019s drug involvement were not so unusual that it \nwould be unlikely to recur. To the contrary, the circumstances, as well as his written \nresponses to inquiries and the nature of his hearing testimony, and my assessment of \nhis poor credibility, cast substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. He has abstained from drug use since March 7, 2005, and \napparently now recognizes the negative impact his drug involvement has had on him. \nThis is obviously a positive consideration. However, considering the eight year period of \nSOR-alleged drug involvement pertaining to marijuana, the three and one-half years \nsince his last SOR-alleged drug-related arrest, and the two months since he completed \nhis probation stemming from that conviction, I believe the time elapsed does not yet \nsatisfy the full intent of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32 (d). However, as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s \n \n74 Id. \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \ninvoluntary use of PCP, in the absence of evidence indicating it was intentional use, AG \n\u00b6 26(a), applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. While he has repeatedly disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts, his history reflects his ability to make new relationships with \nother drug-using associates. As noted above, despite altering his circumstances, \nenvironments, and geographical locations where drugs were used, and he doesn\u2019t \ncurrently use drugs, he remains in one of those same environments. It appears he may \nhave, at last, changed his own life with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained \nfrom drug abuse since March 2005. However, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) does not fully \napply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply because Applicant has not offered any specific \nevidence regarding the nature of the programs he was enrolled in other than to \ngenerally describe them as court-mandated group counseling and classes. It is, \ntherefore, unclear if the programs described qualify as a \u201cprescribed drug treatment \nprogram.\u201d Furthermore, even if the programs did so qualify, there is no evidence of a \n\u201cfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d Moreover, it is clear that \nApplicant resumed his drug involvement after completion of the initial court-mandated \ngroup counseling and classes. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, and by inference, a public trust position, \nby considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The \nAdministrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and by inference, a public trust position, must be an overall common \nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept. I have addressed some of those factors in my analysis under \nGuidelines J and H above, but some additional comment is warranted.      \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and criminal conduct, was, in many instances, \nfelonious conduct, the seriousness of which cannot be minimized. His decisions to \npurchase, possess, and use marijuana, and possess drug paraphernalia, over a \nsubstantial period, were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. While the early \nconduct of merely using marijuana while in high school can be looked at in one way, the \ncontinued drug involvement as an adult, in college and after graduation, was much \nmore serious, and had major implications with the police and court systems. He was \nfully responsible for such conduct. The voluntary continuation of such drug involvement \nand criminal conduct, even after he had been arrested on numerous occasions, \npunished, and required to attend group drug counseling, indicates judgment lapses and \nraises serious concerns which cannot be overlooked. Using the analogy from the \nAppeal Board in financial cases, Applicant has not established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of drug abstinence or steadfast compliance with the law. Taken together, his \nconduct over the years vitiates any other mitigation. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), \n2(a)(3), 2(a)(4), 2(a)(5), 2(a)(6), 2(a)(7), and 2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct \nand drug involvement security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nStephen C. Coen, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nBetween 1987 and 2006, Applicant accrued approximately $70,000 of debt consisting\nprimarily of unpaid state and federal income taxes. All remain outstanding. Notwithstanding the fact\nthat much of his financial problems were caused by personal tragedies, health crises, and\nemployment downturns, it is too soon to conclude that they no longer pose a security risk. Clearance\nis denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nExhibit L, Supervisor\u2019s Reference Letter, dated September 19, 2007.\n1\nTr. 22.\n2\nTr. 22.\n3\nApplicant has lived in three states over the past 20 years, and owes income taxes to each of their respective\n4\nrevenue authorities. From hereinafter, I will refer to the state he lived with his first wife as State 1, the state he lived in\nfrom 1990 to 2006 as State 2, and the state he currently lives as State 3.\n2\nOn June 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as\namended. Applicant answered the SOR on July 7, 2007 and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 6, 2007. On August 14, 2007, DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing scheduling it for September 12, 2007. During the hearing, I received four government\nexhibits, 11 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the close of the hearing, I left the\nrecord open through September 26, 2007 to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He then\nsubmitted four additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record. DOHA received the transcript\non September 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except those encapsulated in the first sentence\nof subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f, and 1.i, respectively. I have incorporated them into the record.\nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with one daughter, age 15. His first marriage ended\nin divorce in 1991. He is a U.S. Navy veteran, serving from 1970 through 1974, and has earned some\ncollege credits through the years.\nApplicant works in the aeronautical industry as a senior quality engineer. His duties include\nwitnessing the proper operation of flight simulators, and ensuring that trainers are operating them\nproperly. According to his supervisor, he is a valued employee.1\nIn 1983, Applicant\u2019s three-year-old daughter from his first marriage died after being struck\nby a drunk driver. He coped with this tragedy fairly well for the first few years.  By the late 1980s,\n2\nhowever, he lapsed into depression. He subsequently lost track of \u201call the things that were\nimportant\u201d  including his finances and his marriage.\n3\nBy the early 1990s, he had divorced his first wife, and moved to another state.  He then met\n4\nand married his current wife, whereupon they had a child in 1992. In 1994 Applicant suffered a heart\nattack. Although he recovered, his condition required ongoing treatment including a major surgical\nprocedure in 1997.\n\nTr. 25.\n5\nExhibit B at 3.\n6\nTr. 54.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 54.\n9\nTr. 54.\n10\nExhibit 1 at 1.\n11\nTr. 58.\n12\nTr. 27, 44.\n13\nTr. 44.\n14\n3\nDuring this same time, Applicant\u2019s wife grew seriously ill, and was bed stricken from 1996\nto 1998.  In the late 1990's, his daughter was diagnosed with a rare, life-threatening disorder. It\n5\nrequired expensive treatment including two major surgeries. Applicant then lapsed into depression\nagain.\nIn the 16 years Applicant lived in State 2, he never found a job that was either commensurate\nwith his skills or that paid as much as the job he held in State 1. Some of the jobs he worked during\nthat time provided no health insurance coverage. 6\nAs Applicant\u2019s problems mounted, he increasingly struggled to pay his yearly income taxes\nand his medical bills. Subsequently, he grew delinquent on federal income taxes for tax years 1985,\n1987 through 1990, 1993, and 1995 (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, and 1.d through 1.h). He\nalso grew delinquent on state income taxes from 1988, 1989 (SOR subparagraph 1.c), and several\nmedical bills (SOR subparagraph 1.j, 1.l through 1.p).  Currently his federal tax delinquency is\napproximately $45,000, his state tax delinquency is $20,000, and he owes $650 in delinquent\nmedical bills. Also, he owes $529 toward the satisfaction of a judgment (subparagraph 1.k).\nIn 1997, Applicant hired an attorney to help him develop a federal income tax repayment\nplan.  He was unable to adhere to it.  At or about the same time, he contacted a credit counselor who\n7\n8\nrecommended he file for bankruptcy protection.  After consulting a bankruptcy attorney, he decided\n9\nnot to file because the filing fees were too expensive.10\nIn March 2006, Applicant moved to State 3 after accepting the job he holds currently.11\nDuring the last three years in State 2, Applicant\u2019s annual income averaged approximately $25,000.\nSince moving to State 3, his annual income has averaged approximately $68,000.  \n12\nShortly after the SOR was issued, Applicant retained an attorney to help him resolve his\ndelinquencies. Through his attorney, he contacted the State 1 income tax authority to determine how\nmuch he currently owes. SOR subparagraph 1.d alleges he owes $3,866 to State 1 for tax years 1988\nand 1989. Upon contacting the income tax authority, he discovered that he now owes approximately\n$16,000 for these tax years.  Currently, he is negotiating a settlement.\n13\n14\n\nTr. 42.\n15\nExhibit I at 1.\n16\nCompare Exhibits H through K.\n17\nExhibits N and O.\n18\nId.\n19\nTr. 31.\n20\n4\nApplicant, through his attorney also contacted the Internal Revenue Service. On June 22,\n2007, he proposed an agreement whereupon he would pay the IRS $500 monthly. Also, he formally\ndisputed the IRS\u2019 claim that he owes $45,000. He contends that $24,000 of his IRS delinquencies\nare statutorily unenforceable because of their age.  To date, the IRS has neither accepted this\n15\ncontention, nor agreed to the installment payment proposal. \nAs of the date of the SOR, Applicant had not filed federal income taxes for tax years 2003\nthrough 2006. He filed them the day before the hearing. He owes $926 for tax year 2005.  He does\n16\nnot owe any income tax for tax years 2003, 2004, and 2006.  \n17\nApplicant\u2019s attorney helped him file State 2 income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. He filed\nthem on September 23, 2007.  He owes $1,876 for tax year 2004 and $3,738 for 2005.  The SOR\n18\n19\ncontains no allegations related to these tax years.\nApplicant is in the process of identifying the collection agencies who currently hold the\nmedical accounts.  He has not yet satisfied any.\n20\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented by DoD on\nSeptember 1, 2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n\nDirective, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n21\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) Paragraph 18.\n22\n5\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n21\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder the Financial Considerations guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s accrual\n22\nof $70,000 of outstanding delinquencies triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d), FC DC 19(c)\n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and FC DC 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond\none\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high\ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d).\nThe extraordinary amount of personal tragedy and employment struggles Applicant\nexperienced over the past 20 years adversely impacted his finances. As his delinquencies mounted\nthrough the 1990s, he made various concerted efforts to confront them, including seeking legal\nassistance, and consulting a credit counseling company. His failure to satisfy them resulted not from\nlack of effort or irresponsibility, but from an inability to pay them. Now that his financial condition\nhas improved, he has renewed his efforts at resolving his delinquencies by retaining an attorney who\nhas developed an IRS payment plan, filed back state taxes, and is in the process of identifying the\nremaining miscellaneous medical creditors. Financial Condition Mitigating Condition (FC MC)\n19(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), FC MC 19(c) (\u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\u201d), and FC MC 19(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), apply.\nSOR subparagraph 1.i alleges Applicant owes an additional $6,100 of IRS debt. It does not\nallege the tax year owed, and Applicant denied it. I conclude the government did not establish the\nallegation listed in subparagraph 1.i. Therefore, I resolve it in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Concept\n\nISCR Case No. 01-03055 (March 21, 2002).\n23\n6\nFrom 1985 to 2006, Applicant accrued approximately $70,000 of delinquent debt. The\nmajority consists of federal and state income tax delinquencies. Regardless of whether $24,000 may\nno longer be statutorily enforceable, the accrual of that much delinquent debt, and its longstanding\nnature are significant negative factors. Their accrual is mitigated somewhat by the horrendous series\nof personal misfortune Applicant experienced over the years. Moreover, since Applicant\u2019s financial\nwell-being began to improve, he has been working  with an attorney to resolve his delinquencies. At\nthis point, however, all of his efforts have involved organizing his finances, identifying creditors,\nand developing payment plans. The IRS, the most significant creditor, has not accepted his proposed\npayment plan, and he has not yet made any payments to the IRS or any of the other creditors. Also,\nhis state income tax delinquencies are substantially higher than alleged in the SOR. Absent any\nconcrete evidence of debt repayments or a demonstrated track record of financial reform, Applicant\u2019s\npromise to satisfy his creditors has limited probative value, regardless of the credibility of his stated\nintentions.  Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s\n23\nfinancial delinquencies remain a security concern.\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not\nattain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance.\nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying\nthe factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant\u2019s current\ncircumstances, a clearance is not recommended, but should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply\nin the future, having established compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed his\nobligations, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security-worthiness. At this time,\nhowever, the granting of a clearance is not warranted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j - 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\n\n7\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n2\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement with one\ndocument attached. The answer was signed on September 2, 2008. He admitted most\nof the factual details of the allegations of the SOR relating to drug use in his answer but\nquestioned the extent of the use. He admitted all of the allegations relating to alcohol\nuse except for the dates of treatment. He denied five financial allegations and admitted\nten with explanations for some of them appended to the answer. He requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on November 5, 2008, for a hearing on November 19, 2008, and it was held on\nthat day. At the hearing, the government offered seven exhibits (Exhs. 1-7) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted ten exhibits (Exhs. A-J) at\nthe hearing. He testified on his own behalf as did four witnesses from his company.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26, 2008. At the request\nof Applicant, the record was held open for 30 days and three evidentiary documents\nwere submitted within that time and admitted without objection (Exhs. K, L, and M). \n          Procedural Rulings\nNotice of Hearing\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr. 10).\nDocumentary Evidence\nApplicant objected to one document (Exh. 6) as irrelevant to this proceeding that\nrelates to an allegation concerning a bankruptcy discharged in 1996. The objection was\noverruled on the basis that it was relevant to the more recent financial allegations. The\ndocument was admitted in evidence (Tr. 19-21).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor since January 2006\nworking as a senior data collector and trainer of over 100 employees in collecting and\nreporting testing information (Tr. 32). He is well regarded by his corporate employer.\nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic and former drug addict.

He\nwas fined $500 and lost his license for four months. This was a wake-up call and his\n\n3\ndrinking declined until 2001 when he drank almost nothing. Now he does not drink any\nalcoholic beverages (Tr. 97-98). However, he failed to realize that his alcohol problem\nwas only part of larger problems involving depression and related mental health issues\n(Exh.

He also\nused gamma (GBH) to bring down the effect of meth (Tr. 58). He became addicted and\nwould occasionally sell drugs as well as use them. He used crystal meth daily for\napproximately one and a half years until 2003. In February 2003 Applicant was arrested\nby the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and charged with possession of meth\nand transporting it for the purpose of sale (Tr. 61). In July 2003 he enrolled in the 12\nstep program of Alanon (Tr. 72) in which he participated until May 2005. He agreed to\ncooperate with the DEA and, in return, was never tried for the drug charge. He worked\nfor the DEA from 2003 until June 2005. During the treatment period he was under the\ncare of a psychiatrist, attended regular weekly meetings, and met with group counselors\n(Tr. 41-42, and 67). He has now been free of substance abuse for nearly six years. In\nJune 2005 he moved away from the drug scene to a smaller city where he now lives.\nAfter several months of unemployment with short periods of employment, he was hired\nfor his present job in January 2006.\nApplicant has been diagnosed with an endocrine parathyroid disease in the last\ntwo years for which he is being treated at considerable expense. The treatment requires\ntravel to out-of- state medical facilities (Tr. 15). Although he has health insurance he is\nrequired to make co-payments that have depleted the excess income over expenses\nthat he reported in his interrogatories (Exhs. 2 and 3). Several of the hospitals and\nmedical agencies have reduced his bills because of his income (Tr. 139). However, he\nstill has medical bills which he is paying (Tr. 115). He has had two surgeries in the past\nyear and now is faced with the probability of open heart surgery sometime in 2009 (Tr.\n116). Despite the medical bills, he has been able to prevent accumulating further debt\nduring this health care crisis. He continues to be able to work (Tr. 43). His net income\nevery two weeks is $2,200 after deductions (Tr. 138). He has never married and has no\nother persons for whom he is responsible. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy for $16,000 in debts that were\ndischarged in 1996 after a security business failed that he had formed with a partner\n(SOR \u00b6 3.a.) (Tr. 103). His current alleged delinquent debts arose during the time when\nhe consumed alcohol to excess and used drugs. He has a tax accountant and\ncounselor who testified at the hearing concerning his work with Applicant to resolve the\nfinancial problems. The tax debts are with the IRS and the California tax authorities\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b. and c.). He has paid down the IRS debt that was originally $14,000 to less\nthan $10,000 of which only $3,000 is principal. Some payments have been made with\ntax refunds which he has managed by overstating withholdings on the advice of his\nemployer. His advisor is working to have the interest and penalties removed (Tr. 114).\nThe state tax debt is $1,114 and is under investigation by the state authorities (Tr. 135).\nHe denies two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3. l. and m.) totaling over $1,700, and is contesting them\n(Exh. J). The remainder of his delinquent debts are for 11 credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n\n4\n3.d.-k. and n.). totaling approximately $11,000 ranging in size from $500 to almost\n$4,000. Six have been charged off and almost all are over six years old. None are in\nactive collection\nApplicant\u2019s accountant and financial advisor testified by telephone conference\ncall at the hearing. He noted that most of these debts are very old, some are beyond the\nstatute of limitations of seven years in his state, some have been dropped, and none\nare in active collection (Tr. 122-130). He is working with Applicant to manage his debts\nand pay the remaining ones in a realistic manner in view of his continuing medical\nproblems and treatment. \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors who describe him as \u201cconsistently\noutstanding\u201d (Exh. A), and as having excellent abilities that he uses in training over a\nhundred employees (Tr. 98). The manager of the corporate office where he works\ntestified for him along with three other supervisors at different supervisory levels. He is\nloyal, competent, reliable, focused, and hard-working. His supervisors and colleagues\nstrongly supported his integrity, work ethic and loyalty (Tr. 28-34, and 90-103). He has\nreceived several awards for his service (Exhs. D and E 1-5) including employee of the\nquarter in 2006. He also works with other recovering drug abusers, alcoholics, and\ntobacco addicts to help them break the habits (Tr. 14). Letters of recommendation were\nsubmitted by several who testified and others who did not (Exhs. A, B, C, and I). He\ndoes not handle or work with classified materials but needs a security clearance to\nenhance flexibility of assignments for his employer (Tr. 32).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nGuideline H Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG \u00b6  24: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n\n6\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include\nany drug abuse AG \u00b6 25 (a), or illegal drug possession including sale of drugs (AG \u00b6 25\n(c). \n         Applicant\u2019s admissions of drug use and the evidence introduced establishes that\nthe potentially disqualifying condition has been met. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides several possible conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\nDrug involvement with illegal drugs is mitigated by the passage of time over a\nperiod of six years. He entered the drug treatment program in 2003 and has removed\nhimself from contact with drug users. He completed the treatment program in 2005 and\nhas been completely free of drugs since entering it. Thus, I conclude that he has\nmitigated the allegations relating to the use of drugs. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption in\nthat, \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The relevant ones to this matter are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n         Thus, the evidence submitted clearly raises these potentially disqualifying\nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n        Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems were largely resolved in 1998. Since that time he has\nbeen treated for both alcohol and drug abuse, successfully completed a program over\nthree years ago, and is free of both substances. He has mitigated the security concerns.\n\n8\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and\nwas unable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. The evidence shows\nthat he has been able pay some of the debts and has worked out a payment plan for\nothers consistent with his limited income. Thus the evidence clearly raises these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several mitigating conditions (MC) that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control through business downturn or unexpected\nmedical emergency. Most of Applicant=s first financial problems arose as a result of his\nbusiness failure in 1996, and his current medical condition and the requirements for\ntreatment were and are beyond his control. Thus, this mitigating condition is applicable\nfor those issues. \nAG & 20 (c) applies when the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control. Applicant has received and continues to receive good advice from his\ncredit counselor and has a plan that is being implemented with the income available. \nAG & 20 (d) applies where the evidence shows the person initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary that\nall of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to apply, it is necessary that a\nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. \nAG & 20 (e) applies when the person has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of of the debt and provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. Applicant\nhas shown that the two denied debts are being disputed with the help of professionals. \n\n9\nApplicant has shown that both his federal and state tax debts are being resolved\nand that he is not accumulating further debt. His professional advisor has analyzed the\nstatus of the remaining credit card debts to my satisfaction. They are being resolved as\nbest Applicant can and they pose no threat to national security. The mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe concerns. By his mid-thirties he changed himself from an alcoholic drug abuser to a\nworthwhile citizen holding a responsible position in the defense industry. He is admired\nand trusted by his employer and his supervisors. He has removed himself from the drug\nscene and does not drink even on social occasions. His health is a continuing problem\nbut it is not adding to any of the issues presented to me. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for\naccess to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n10\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.:For Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT \n Subparagraph 3.a.:For Applicant \n Subparagraph 3.b.:For Applicant \n Subparagraph 3.c.:For Applicant \n Subparagraph 3.d.:For Applicant \n Subparagraph 3.e.:For Applicant \n Subparagraph 3.f.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.g.:For Applicant\n Subparagraph 3.h.:For Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.i.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.j.: For Applicant\n Subparagraph 3.k.:For Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.l.:  For Applicant\n Subparagraph 3.m.:For Applicant\n Subparagraph 3.n.:For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by lthe record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant at this time.

Her delinquent debts total more\nthan $35,000. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on her financial problems.\nClearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 20, 43; GE 1.\n2\nTr. at 18-21; GE 1.\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On March 9, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on March 29, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 2, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 3, 2007, scheduling the\nhearing for June 4, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nGovernment offered three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and\nadmitted without objections. Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary evidence.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has never been married and\nhas no children.2\nApplicant was employed by a company for about ten years, from 1991 to 2001. She went to\na different company in about January 2001. In about August 2002, Applicant was laid off from her\njob. Applicant struggled financially while she was unemployed. She survived through loans from\nfamily and friends, and by credit. While she was unemployed, she decided to use that opportunity\nto further her education. She obtained an associate degree in about October 2003. By the time she\nfinished school, Applicant was in serious debt. From November 2003 to present, Applicant has\nworked for a government contractor.3\nApplicant admitted to all the debts listed in the SOR. The medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\nand 1.c, totaling $440, are to a collection agency, collecting on behalf of a medical provider.\nApplicant testified the medical bills resulted either from when she was unemployed and did not have\n\nTr. at 27-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 3.\n4\nTr. at 26-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 1.\n5\nTr. at 34-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 3.\n6\nTr. at 22-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 2-3.\n7\nGE 2 at 2, 8; GE 3 at 1, 3.\n8\nTr. at 24-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 1.\n9\nTr. at 29-30, 38-39.\n10\n3\ninsurance, or when she was insured, made a partial payment, and thought the debt was fully paid,\nwhen it was not. She has paid several medical debts, but she admits she has not paid these debts.4\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in the amount of $10,130, is to a collection agency, collecting on\nbehalf of a credit card company. Applicant testified she attempted to make payment arrangements,\nbut the creditor would only accept payments of $900 at a time, and Applicant was unable to make\npayments that large.5\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in the amount of $8,375, is to a collection agency, collecting on a loan\nApplicant received. This debt is still outstanding.6\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.i, in the total amount of $17,314, are for delinquent\nstudent loans. Applicant testified that her wages have been garnished for these debts for about the\npast six to seven months, at approximately $115 to $120 per week, and more if she works overtime.7\nSOR \u00b6 1.j lists a debt to a medical provider in the approximate amount of $487. The SOR\ndoes not list the creditor\u2019s name. The credit reports introduced as GE 2 and 3, also do not list the\ncreditor\u2019s name. After scrutinizing the credit reports, I am unable to determine if the debt listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.j, is a separate debt, or an aggregate of the three medical debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and\n1.c.8\nA judgment of $3,604 was obtained against Applicant in about November 2006, by a credit\ncollection company, on behalf of a department store, as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant testified she\nattempted to make payment arrangements, but the creditor would only accept larger payments than\nshe was able to make.9\nApplicant testified she has contacted a few credit counseling organizations, but did not utilize\ntheir services, as their services amounted to Applicant taking a loan from them at a higher interest\nrate than her debts.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n14\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n15\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n16\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a). \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt, which remains\nmostly unpaid. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant has numerous unpaid debts. She has serious current financial problems. FC MC\n20(a) does not apply. Much of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties started when Applicant lost her job,\na condition that was largely beyond her control. However, Applicant has worked for her current\nemployer since November 2003, and has done very little to pay her debts. I do not find that Applicant\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. FC MC 20(b) is partially applicable. \nApplicant has not received counseling for her problems. Her wages are being garnished for\nher defaulted student loans, but there is minimal evidence of any voluntary payments of her\ndelinquent debts. Applicant has not shown a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts, and there is no clear indication that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\nFC MC 20(c) and FC MC 20(d) do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues stem mainly from a period of unemployment, but she has worked\nfor her current employer for more than three years, and has done very little to address her delinquent\n\n6\ndebts. I also considered that there is nothing adverse in Applicant\u2019s record other than her financial\nproblems. Applicant appears to be a hard-working woman who is just trying to make her way in life.\nUnfortunately her delinquent debts total more than $35,000. Applicant does not have a viable plan\nfor addressing her debts. This makes her vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on her financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is\ngranted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 26, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 16, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 3, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 27, 2007.  At\nthe hearing the Government presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented eleven exhibits and\ntestified on her own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on September 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and\nthe testimony.  The Applicant is 49 years of age and holds a Bachelors of Business Administration\nin Accounting and is presently pursuing her Master\u2019s in Business Administration.  She is employed\nas a Financial Analyst and seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the\ndefense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.  She grew up there until she was eighteen.\nIn 1980, after a year in Lagos, and with encouragement and financial support from her parents, she\ncame to the United States under a student visa where she attended college and obtained her\naccounting degree.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  Her husband is deceased, and she has twin boys who\nwere born in the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I and H). The Applicant decided to become a\nUnited States citizen in February 2005, because of her native born American twin boys.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C).  After becoming a United States citizen, the Applicant did not travel to Nigeria, allowed\nher Nigerian passport to expire and did not renew it, renounced her Nigerian citizenship by letter and\nsurrendered her Nigerian passport to the Consulate.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).      \nOf her seven siblings, the Applicant has a brother who is a medical doctor and who is a\ncitizen of and resides in the United States.  She has two brothers who are permanent residents of the\nUnited States, residing here.  They both intend to become citizens of the United States and\npermanently reside here.  Of her four sisters, three are citizens of and reside in Nigeria.  The other\ntemporarily lives in Ghana.  The sister in Ghana is a pastor.  She and her husband are doing\nmissionary work that requires them to travel and they are only in Ghana temporarily.   The Applicant\nknows that one of her sisters is a salesperson and she has little or no contact with the other two.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother is 73 years old, a retired school principal, and a permanent resident\nof the United States who is trying to obtain her United States citizenship in order to permanently\n\n3\nrelocate here.  The Applicant\u2019s father is deceased.  Her retirement is not much so all of the siblings\nsupport her.  The Applicant sends her mother about $500.00 a year at the most.  The Applicant\u2019s\nmother currently travels between the United States and Nigeria in order to visit her children.  She\nstays with the Applicant sometimes as long as six months at a time.  The Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s\nfamily all resides in the United States.   \nThe Applicant traveled to Nigeria in 1999 for three weeks to bury her husband, who was a\nprince, the son of the Chief of the village.  She returned to Nigeria in 2000 to have closure of her\nhusband\u2019s death.  She also traveled to Nigeria twice in 2003 and once in 2004.    \nThe Applicant has no assets in Nigeria and does not stand to inherit anything.  None of her\nfamily is associated in any way with the Nigerian government.\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Nigeria.  The fact that\nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states, which has a very poor human rights record.\nHuman rights violations include police brutality, armed robberies and murders to name a few.  I have\nconsidered the fact that Nigerian Government officials at all levels commit serious abuses.  The fact\nthat Nigeria has terrorists activities, presents potential danger to Americans who travel there, and is\nrampant with crime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Nigeria, the human\nrights abuses and the government corruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.    \nI have also taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Ghana.  Its human\nrights record is better than Nigeria\u2019s however, there still exists government corruption, including\nexcessive use of force by police, vigilante justice, police corruption and impunity, arbitrary arrest\nand detention, and prolonged pretrial detention to name a few. \nThe Applicant has not discussed the fact that she is applying for a security clearance with her\nmother or her siblings in Nigeria.\nMitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s 90 day performance review reflects \u201coutstanding ratings\u201d or \u201cconsistently meets\nstandards\u201d in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor indicates that the Applicant is \u201can invaluable\nprogram asset and she is ready to assume greater responsibilities withing the program and company\u201d.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  \nA letter from her pastor indicates that the Applicant is a person of integrity and honesty.  She\nis well known in the church community and is supportive of the church activities and their mission.\nShe is a member of St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church and her sons attended the church school through\n2005.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  \nPOLICIES\n\n4\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign country or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  \n7.  Condition that could raise a security concern:\n7(a) Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n7(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if the\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\n8.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8 (a) The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n5\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes\ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or\nnexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard\nclassified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates that his foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The mere\n\n6\npossession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be\ncounted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The\nGovernment must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide\nby all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and\nhaving assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes\nthat the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's\nforeign contacts have a direct and negative impact on her suitability for access to classified\ninformation.  \nThe Applicant was born in Nigeria and immigrated to the United States, where she has lived\nfor the past twenty-seven years.  She became a naturalized United States citizen in February 2005\nand renounced her Nigerian citizenship and surrendered her Nigerian passport.  She has twin sons\nwho are native born American citizens that have impacted her decision to make the United States\nher permanent home. With respect to Guideline B, the overall deteriorating security situation in\nNigeria, the human rights abuses and the government corruption in Nigeria certainly elevates the\ncause for concern in the case.  However, under the particular facts of this case, the evidence\nestablishes that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  The only regular contact the\nApplicant has with anyone in Nigeria is with her mother who travels between Nigeria and the United\nStates to visit her children on a fairly frequent basis.  Her mother is a permanent resident of the\nUnited States and she is trying to obtain her citizenship in order to permanently relocate here.    \n  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating whether the Applicant meets\nthe qualifications for access to classified information.  The Applicant\u2019s qualities, characteristics and\ncircumstances have been considered.  The Applicant came to the United States at the age of eighteen\nand has made it her permanent home.  She was the first in her family to make the United States her\npermanent home.  Since immigrating to the United States, the Applicant has been a productive\nmember of society.  She has obtained her Bachelor\u2019s degree and is currently working on her Master\u2019s\ndegree.  She has established a professional career employed for a defense contractor and has\ndemonstrated that she is an invaluable asset to the program.  She has excelled in accomplishing the\nAmerican dream.  She has demonstrated her loyalty and commitment to the United States.  She has\nexpressed strong positive feelings toward the United States and is grateful for the opportunities that\nshe has found both through her ability to obtain higher education and in her professional\ndevelopment.  She is well respected by his superiors and professional colleagues.  The Applicant is\na credible, intelligent, and forthright individual.  Most importantly, she understands her\nresponsibilities to the United States when holding a security clearance and will never under any\ncircumstances improperly divulge classified information.  The current political conditions in Nigeria,\nalthough horrible, do not adversely effected the Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. \nUnder Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) Contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\n\n7\npressure, or coercion and 7(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if the relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions 8 (a) The nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities\nof those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization or government\nand the interests of the U.S. and 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\nare applicable.  The Applicant has three brothers who are citizens and residents of the United States\nand a mother who is in the process of obtaining her United States citizenship in order to relocate\nhere.  The Applicant has little or no contact with her four sisters who remain in Nigeria or Ghana.\nArguably, the Applicant\u2019s mother who was at one time a school principal, could be said to\nhave worked for the Nigerian Government, as the school was a public school available to all\nNigerian citizens.  She is now retired and has been for many years.  Her small pension from the\nNigerian Government provides little in the way of financial support.  The Applicant and her siblings\nsend money to their mother to help support her.  However, given the number of siblings involved,\nthe Applicant sends only as much as $500.00 a year.  The Applicant\u2019s mother is no longer associated\nwith the Nigerian government, or is she in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or\nin a position to be exploited by the Nigerian Government in a way that could force the Applicant to\nchoose between loyalty to her and loyalty to the United States.  The Applicant has for the most part\ncut all ties with Nigeria.  The Applicant understands her responsibility to the United States in holding\na security clearance.  Based on the foregoing, the Applicant\u2019s relatives in Nigeria do not raise a\nsecurity concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.   \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nB of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met\nher ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    \nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant \n1.b.: For the Applicant\n1.c.: For the Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n\n8\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old senior information systems engineer who has worked for a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor since April 2006 (Tr. 36). He is single and has no children. He attended college from September 1997 to May 2002, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. In January 2007, he started his masters degree in information systems with a concentration in management (Tr. 102). Applicant\u2019s employment history reflects that after college he was unemployed from May 2002 to July 2003. From July 2003 to April 2006, Applicant worked for three difference companies. As part of the hiring process, he was required to participate in drug testing, which he passed. He also was subject to unannounced drug testing while in those job positions (Tr. 91).

RIVERA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nFrom 1998 to February 2006, Applicant consumed and sometimes binged on alcohol to the\npoint that his judgment was impaired as evidenced by his illegal use of drugs in at least 11 different\noccasions. There is no evidence of illegal drug use or excessive alcohol consumption since February\n2006. Considering the evidence as a whole, his favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate\nthe security concerns raised by his behavior under the Guidelines for alcohol consumption, drug\ninvolvement, and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\n\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n1\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR\ninformed Applicant that, based on available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a\npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\naccess to classified information and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security\ndetermination.  On July 25, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\n1\nThe case was assigned to me on August 29, 2007. The Notice of Hearing was issued on\nSeptember 5, 2007, convening a hearing on October 3, 2007. The hearing was convened as\nscheduled. The government presented two exhibits, marked GE 1-2, to support the SOR. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and presented 11 exhibits, marked AE 1-11. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on October 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of facts. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old senior information systems engineer who has worked for a\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) contractor since April 2006 (Tr. 36). He is single and has no children.\nHe attended college from September 1997 to May 2002, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer\nscience. In January 2007, he started his masters degree in information systems with a concentration\nin management (Tr. 102).\nApplicant\u2019s employment history reflects that after college he was unemployed from May 2002\nto July 2003. From July 2003 to April 2006, Applicant worked for three difference companies. As\npart of the hiring process, he was required to participate in drug testing, which he passed. He also was\nsubject to unannounced drug testing while in those job positions (Tr. 91). In April 2006, he was hired\nby his current employer and moved from his home state to his employer\u2019s state. There is no evidence\nhe has mishandled or compromised classified information while working for his employer. \nApplicant\u2019s security concerns arose as a result of his alcohol consumption and his illegal use\nof drugs. He began consuming alcohol at age 17 while attending high school. He consumed alcohol\nduring parties and the weekends, usually sharing a six pack of beer with friends (Tr. 74). During\ncollege he consumed alcohol occasionally, drinking approximately a six pack of beer at a sitting\nduring the weekends and at parties. He played inter collegiate soccer and did not drink alcoholic\n\n3\nbeverages during the soccer season from June to October (Tr. 75). While in college, he binged on\nalcoholic beverages on at least two occasions at fraternity parties (Tr. 76). \nAt his hearing, Applicant initially claimed that after graduating from college he only\nconsumed alcoholic beverages occasionally (Tr. 78). During cross-examination he admitted, however,\nthat after college he went through a \u201cspurt\u201d when he drank one gallon of beer a day, one or two times\na week, for about two months (Tr. 96-97). He reduced his drinking after receiving a job offer around\nJuly 2003.\nApplicant testified that since April 2006, when he started working for his current employer,\nhe only consumes alcohol occasionally (during ball games and parties), and in moderation (Tr. 85).\nHe currently consumes between three to six beers at a sitting, approximately three times a month (Tr.\n79). He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. He modified his drinking habits for several\nreasons, i.e., he wanted to do well at his current job, he was concerned about his health, and\ndisappointing his parents.\nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of drugs is related to his alcohol consumption. He illegally used\nPercocet (in March 2005) (Tr. 37-40), Vicadin (three times in April 2005) (Tr. 45-47), and Darvocet\n(in February 2006) to enhance the effects of alcohol (Tr. 68-69). He did not have a prescription when\nhe used these drugs. He used these drugs before going out to parties so that he could get \u201cbuzzed\u201d\nquickly without having to consume too much alcohol to get into a dancing mood (Tr. 40). He illegally\nused Vicadin to get rid of the effects of his hangovers. His then girlfriend had a prescription for\nPercocet and she gave Percocet to him. She also gave him the Vicadin and the Darvocet, which she\nacquired from her friends.\nApplicant provided several explanations for his illegal use of drugs, i.e., he was curious about\nthe effects of the drugs, and the effect of the drugs mixed with alcohol; he self-medicated himself for\nhis hangovers; and he broke-up his relationship with his girlfriend of six and one-half years (Tr. 44-\n45). He claimed he never used drugs before age 25, even while at college. He explained he was a\nmember of the Boy Scouts until he was 18 years old and stayed away from drugs. Moreover, his two\nolder brothers were addicted to drugs. His 39-year-old brother was addicted to cocaine, underwent\ntreatment, and has been clean for 15 years. His 38-year-old brother was addicted to \u201ccrystal meth,\u201d\nunderwent treatment, and has been clean for two years (Tr. 94). He never used drugs with his\nbrothers. He experienced his family being ripped apart by his brothers\u2019 addiction and he did not want\nto add to his parent\u2019s pain (Tr. 43). His father was an alcoholic and, when Applicant was growing up\nhe advised him against using illegal drugs and drinking alcohol (Tr. 83).\nIn September 2005, Applicant used ecstasy while at a party where he had been drinking\nalcohol (Tr. 49). A friend offered it to him, and he took it out of curiosity. He used cocaine twice\nduring September 2005, and once in November 2005 (Tr. 53-59). He explained he used cocaine the\nfirst time out of curiosity. The second time he claimed he was somewhat forced to use it. He\naccompanied his friend to purchase cocaine and Applicant was too scared to refuse it when it was\noffered. He used marihuana in September 2005, because of peer pressure (Tr. 63-64). Applicant\nillegally used Adderall twice in February 2006. Both times he had been drinking the night before and\nwoke up tired and with a bad hangover. A friend suggested he take the Adderall to boost up his energy\nlevel and help him get rid of the hangover, and he did. Applicant did not have a prescription for the\nAdderall (Tr. 65-66). Applicant knew his use of these drugs was illegal. \n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n2\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of \u201cthe nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n4\nApplicant averred he has not used any drugs illegally since February 2006, when he received\nthe job offer from his current employer. He knows that such behavior will not be tolerated, and that\nhis job is at stake if he were to use illegal drugs. He has not participated in any alcohol or drug\nrehabilitative treatment or counseling (Tr. 71). Applicant has no intention to use drugs illegally ever\nagain. He is concerned about losing his job, his heath, and not causing any more pain and\ndisappointment to his parents (Tr. 73). His parents are not aware of his use of drugs. When asked to\nexplain why he experimented with drugs if he knew that his brothers\u2019 drug abuse had ripped his\nfamily apart, Applicant stated \u201cI knew it was a mistake, and I guess I didn\u2019t think about my family\nat the time\u201d (Tr. 93). \nApplicant claimed he no longer has contact with most of the friends with whom he used drugs\nand/or consumed alcohol. When he was hired for his current job he moved from his home state to his\ncurrent state of residence. He only visits his family at his home state every two to three months, and\nhas infrequent contacts with his high school and college friends (Tr. 87). He still has infrequent\ncontact with at least three of the people with whom he used drugs, but he claimed they no longer use\nillegal drugs.\nApplicant expressed remorse for his past behavior. He promised never to engage in such\nbehavior again. He considers himself to be reliable and trustworthy, and asserts he has good\njudgment. In support of his assertions, he submitted a performance evaluation report (AE 1). His\nsupervisors and coworkers consider Applicant technically proficient, reliable, and recommended him\nfor a position of responsibility. He is characterized as a hard-working, honest  person, with\noutstanding duty performance, and excellent work ethics (AE 2-11). In general, his references attest\nto Applicant\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, good judgment, and dependability. Because of his significant\ncontributions to his employer, he was awarded his company\u2019s annual achievement award. Moreover,\nhis references confirm Applicant distanced himself from old friends who were bad influences, and\nnote his willingness to consume alcohol in moderation.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take into\naccount both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.2\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n3\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n4\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.3, at 528, 531.\n5\n  See id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant\nAGs.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n3\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of\none who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n4\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the burden\nof persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\n5\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of\nprotecting national security.6\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline H, the government\u2019s concern is that the use of an illegal drug or misuse of\na prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24.\nThe government established its case by showing that from March 2005 to February 2006,\nApplicant used illegal drugs, i.e., cocaine (twice), and marihuana and ecstasy (once each). During the\nsame period of time, he illegally used prescription drugs (Percocet and Darvocet once each, Vicadin\n\n  The AGs do not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct.\n7\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a\nwhole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant's conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jan. 26, 2006). \n6\nthree times, and Adderall twice) without a prescription. Drug involvement disqualifying conditions\nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, applies.\nApplicant\u2019s evidence raised several mitigating conditions that I considered potentially\napplicable under AG \u00b6 26:\n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and,\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence.\nAccording to his testimony and character references, Applicant has not used drugs illegally\nfor approximately 19 months. Applicant disassociated himself from most of his drug-using friends,\nand has avoided environments where drugs are used. His change in behavior resulted from his work-\nrelated move to another state, as well as his desire to remain drug abstinent, to consume alcohol in\nmoderation, to pursue a healthy lifestyle, and to protect his job. His testimony and change in lifestyle\ndemonstrate his intent not to use illegal drugs and to consume alcohol in moderation. Mitigating\ncondition AG \u00b6 26(b) applies.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude AG 26(a) does not\n7\napply. I find Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior recent, and it raises serious about his judgment and\nwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s father was an alcoholic and counseled him\nagainst the dangers of drugs and abusing alcohol. Two of his brothers were addicted to illegal drugs\nand their addiction \u201cripped apart\u201d his family. Applicant started using drugs at age 25, after completing\ncollege, because he broke-up with his girlfriend, and he was curious about the effects of drugs\ncombined with alcohol. \nHis drug abuse is intertwined to his alcohol consumption. He mixed illegal drugs and alcohol\nto enhance the effects of the alcohol. He then used illegal drugs the next day to arrest the adverse\neffects of his bad hangovers. Considering his history of excessive alcohol consumtion, Applicant\u2019s\ncombined abuse of alcohol and drugs heightens the security concerns raised by his behavior.\nApplicant continues to consume alcohol albeit allegedly in moderation. He presented no evidence to\nshow he has participated in any drug or alcohol treatment or counseling. Because of the number of\ntimes he used illegal drugs, and his history of alcohol consumption, I find his use of drugs to be\nfrequent. Considering the totality of the circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I find his favorable\nevidence fails to establish his questionable behavior is not likely to recur. Moreover, his behavior cast\nserious doubts on his trustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to comply with the law.\n\n7\nUnder Guideline G, the government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21.\nThe government established its case by showing that from about 1998 to February 2006,\nApplicant consumed, and sometimes consumed alcohol to the point that his judgment was impaired\nas evidenced by his illegal use of drugs on at least 11 different occasions. AG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and AG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, apply.\nApplicant has acknowledged his problems with alcohol, and provided evidence to show he\nis taking action to overcome this problem. He has established a pattern of responsible use as\ndemonstrated by his outstanding work performance. There is no evidence he has been involved in any\nmisconduct related to alcohol or drug use.\nNotwithstanding, for the same reasons outline in the discussion of Guideline H (above), I find\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol related concerns are recent. His favorable information fails to establish his\nquestionable behavior is not likely to recur, and his questionable behavior still casts doubts on\nApplicant\u2019s good judgment and trustworthiness. \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct) the government\u2019s concern is that conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during\nthe security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 15.\nThe government established its case by showing that from about 1998 to February 2006,\nApplicant consumed, and sometimes consumed alcohol to the point that his judgment was impaired\nas evidenced by his illegal use of drugs in at least 11 different occasions. Applicant\u2019s behavior\nshowed questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations. Personal Conduct disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing . . ., applies.\nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs constitute serious offenses, and as such they cannot be easily\ndismissed. For the same reasons discussed under Guidelines H and G, incorporated herein, I consider\nApplicant\u2019s behavior under Guideline E not mitigated by the passage of time. Considering the\nevidence as a whole, not enough time has transpired since his questionable behavior for Applicant\nto establish that his behavior is unlikely to recur. Additionally, Applicant failed to disclosed his past\nquestionable behavior to his parents. Applicant\u2019s friends and supervisors provided him with excellent\nrecommendations. It is not clear, however, whether his character references knew the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s drug and alcohol involvement when they provided their recommendations. Applicant has\nfailed to reduce the possibility of vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. After\n\n8\nconsidering all the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of the\nmitigation conditions apply.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence and applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nas listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s testimony; his age, education,\nwork experience, and the testimony of his character references. I also considered that there is no\nevidence he has engaged in questionable conduct for over one and one-half years. In light of the\ntotality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the\nsecurity clearance concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section\nE3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Alcohol Consumption\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a \nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old and employed as a senior manufacturing associate by a defense contractor. He was initially hired by his employer in November 1998, and applied for a security clearance at that time. However, because he was laid off due to lack of work from December 2001 through January 2004, his background investigation was cancelled. A new background investigation was initiated when he submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on or about June 23, 2004. 4 Applicant was born and raised in Iran. He came to the U.S. in 1977 to study electrical engineering at Oklahoma State University, where he received his BSEE in 1981. In July 1986, he married a native-born U.S. citizen. They had three children, now ages 22, 20, and 7, before the marriage ended in divorce in 2006. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 18, 1986. On April 1, 1998, he received a U.S. passport. 5 His mother, three brothers, and one sister are all citizens of and live in Iran. Applicant calls his mother several times each week to check on her well-being. Because he knows Iranian authorities may be listening, he is careful to keep his conversation with her benign; that is, he avoids talking about politics or his work or anything other than routine family matters.

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give him a security clearance. On\n1\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Tr., 13 - 15.\n3\n Gx. 1.\n4\n Id., Tr., 19.\n5\n2\nMay 14, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\nsecurity concerns about possible foreign influence (Guideline B) and possible foreign preference\n(Guideline C).2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, admitted all of the allegations therein, and requested\na hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 30, 2007, and I convened a hearing on September\n12, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled. I admitted three exhibits proffered by the\ngovernment (Gx. 1- 3). A pre-hearing submission by the government, which consists of a six-page\nlegal memorandum and eight documents attached thereto, is included in the record for purposes of\nadministrative notice as Judicial Exhibit (Jx.) I.  Applicant testified in his own behalf, but offered\n3\nno exhibits. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as facts. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is 56 years old and employed as a senior manufacturing associate by a defense\ncontractor. He was initially hired by his employer in November 1998, and applied for a security\nclearance at that time. However, because he was laid off due to lack of work from December 2001\nthrough January 2004, his background investigation was cancelled. A new background investigation\nwas initiated when he submitted a security clearance application (SF 86)  on or about June 23, 2004.\n4\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. He came to the U.S. in 1977 to study electrical\nengineering at Oklahoma State University, where he received his BSEE in 1981. In July 1986, he\nmarried a native-born U.S. citizen. They had three children, now ages 22, 20, and 7, before the\nmarriage ended in divorce in 2006. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 18,\n1986. On April 1, 1998, he received a U.S. passport.  \n5\nHis mother, three brothers, and one sister are all citizens of and live in Iran. Applicant calls\nhis mother several times each week to check on her well-being. Because he knows Iranian authorities\nmay be listening, he is careful to keep his conversation with her benign; that is, he avoids talking\nabout politics or his work or anything other than routine family matters. He only speaks with his\nsiblings if they happen to be with their mother. He has not seen his mother or siblings since 1978,\nwhen he last visited Iran because his mother was ill. Applicant wanted to visit Iran in 1994 to see\n\n Tr., 43 - 47.\n6\n Tr., 48 - 49.\n7\n Jx. I, Attachments 1- 3, 5. \n8\n Jx. I, Attachments 4, 6, 7.\n9\n3\nhis again ailing mother, but decided not to because he was concerned he would not be allowed to\nleave Iran.6\nApplicant had a passport from the pre-revolutionary government of Iran when he became a\nU.S. citizen. He allowed it to lapse for about 15 years before he requested and was given a new\npassport by the Islamic Republic of Iran on January 14, 2005. As with his U.S. passport, he has not\nyet used it. However, he acquired the passport to facilitate travel to Iran to see his mother should she\nbecome sick again. He knows it is difficult to obtain a travel visa to Iran using his U.S. passport. He\nis unwilling to relinquish his Iranian passport.\nApplicant served in the Iranian military from 1972 until 1974 to satisfy a mandatory service\nrequirement. Neither he nor his mother and siblings has any current ties to the Iranian government.\nHis mother is in her 70s and probably did not work outside the home. His sister and her husband are\nretired school teachers. One brother owns his own truck for transporting oil. Another works for an\noil refinery, and the third is a retired oil refinery worker.\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran. He owns a home in the U.S., and there is no\ninformation showing he maintains any bank accounts outside the U.S., but he has occasionally sent\nmoney to his mother to pay for unplanned events, such as home repairs. The most he has sent at one\ntime is $1,000.   \n7\nIn 1979, the Shah of Iran was overthrown in favor of a theocratic government based on\nIslamic law. Despite occasional gains by more moderate Muslim clerics in the government, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran (IRI) remains under the control of fundamentalists dedicated to a repressive\nform of government in furtherance of strict adherence to the Koran. Iran\u2019s regime has amassed a\ndismal human rights record. Government entities have been involved in an increased number of\nabductions, summary executions, disappearance, torture, and other unacceptable practices designed\nto preserve the government\u2019s hold over its citizens. The U.S. State Department has also advised U.S.\ncitizens not to travel to Iran, and has noted instances whereby dual U.S.-Iranian citizens have been\nsingled out for special monitoring and detention.8\nIran\u2019s global interests are directly antithetical to those of the U.S.. To further their regional\nand global goals, Iran has become an active collector of economic information and has an active\nespionage service which targets U.S. interests and information. Iran is also an active sponsor of\nterrorism, which targets the interests of the U.S. and its allies. Finally, the development and\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction by Iran is seen by the U.S.\nas a major threat to regional and possibly global stability.9\n\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are as follows: 1. Nature and seriousness\n10\nof the conduct and surrounding circumstances; 2. Frequency and recency of the conduct; 3. Age of the applicant; 4.\nMotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; 5. Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and 6. Probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n11\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n12\n See Egan; Directive E2.2.2.\n13\n4\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nSecurity clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed\nin Section 6.3 of the Directive.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition\n10\nis not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent\npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this case, the\npleadings and the information presented by the parties at hearing require that Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines B (foreign influence) and C (foreign preference) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n11\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a\nheavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n12\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.13\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference. The government denied Applicant\u2019s request for clearance, in part\nbecause, after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1986 and obtaining a U.S. passport in 1998, he exercised\nhis Iranian citizenship by obtaining and possessing, as of April 2007, a valid Iranian passport. (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c). The information presented through the Government\u2019s exhibits, Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, and his testimony is sufficient to support these allegations. The established facts, in turn,\nraise a security concern addressed by Guideline C of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 9.\n14\n \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\n15\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport;\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(a).\n16\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(b).\n17\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(e). \n18\n5\nSpecifically, the government is concerned that, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  In\n14\n2005, he raised a security concern by acquiring an Iranian passport nearly 20 years after becoming\na U.S. citizen. He still holds the passport, which is still valid, and he does not intend to relinquish\nit because it will facilitate entry to Iran should he want to see his mother, to whom he is very close.\n The foregoing requires consideration of Guideline C disqualifying condition 10(a).15\nApplicant\u2019s passport allows him to travel as an Iranian citizen despite his U.S. citizenship. It also\nreflects Applicant\u2019s divided preference between the U.S. and Iran. This facet of the Government\u2019s\nconcern is heightened by the fact he has been in the U.S. for 30 years and has been a U.S. citizen\nsince 1986. By contrast, Applicant\u2019s foreign citizenship, if based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship,16\nand if he never exercised post-naturalization his rights as an Iranian citizen, would not be\ndisqualifying. But an act in furtherance of a right or privilege of foreign citizenship after\nnaturalization, such as Applicant\u2019s acquisition of his Iranian passport in 2005, makes such mitigation\nunavailable. \nMitigation of the foreign preference concerns raised by his active exercise of foreign\ncitizenship might also be available if Applicant expressed a willingness to renounce his Iranian\ncitizenship.   (Subsequent acquisition of a new Iranian passport renders this moot and to add it here\n17\nis confusing) The concerns about his possession of the Iranian passport he obtained in 2005 may\nhave been mitigated if Applicant had relinquished, destroyed, or otherwise rendered it invalid.18\nHowever, Applicant affirmatively stated his desire to maintain his Iranian citizenship so he may, in\nturn, retain the passport for ease of travel to Iran to see his mother.  Accordingly, none of the\nGuideline C mitigating conditions apply,  and I resolve this guideline against Applicant.\nForeign Preference. The Government also stated as reasons for denying Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a clearance the fact his mother (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and his siblings (SOR \u00b6 2.b) are all citizens of and\nreside in Iran. Information presented through the Government\u2019s exhibits, Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nand his testimony is sufficient to support these allegations. The established facts, in turn, raise a\nsecurity concern addressed by Guideline B of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Specifically, the\nGovernment is concerned that \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n19\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7(a). \n20\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8(a). \n21\n See, Revised Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 8(c).\n22\n6\nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s contact with his mother and, to a lesser extent, his siblings, who are citizens\n19\nof and reside in Iran, may be disqualifying \u201cif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  In assessing whether these facts\n20\npresent a heightened risk, I have considered the fact that Applicant is very close to and concerned\nabout his elderly mother. He calls her several times each week to check on her well-being, and he\nhas obtained an Iranian passport to make it easier to travel to Iran to see her before she dies or if she\nbecomes ill. His relationship with his siblings appears to be more distant, and he speaks with them\nonly if they happen to be present when he calls. \nI have also considered the repressive nature of the Iranian government towards its own\npeople, particularly where dual U.S.-Iranian citizens are concerned. I have also considered Iran\u2019s\nsponsorship of international terrorism, aggressive economic espionage and foreign intelligence\nactivities, all of which are conducted in furtherance of its strategic, political, and economic interests\nhostile and opposed to those of the U.S. and its allies. Also probative of whether Applicant\u2019s contact\nwith his family in Iran creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation is his own concern about\nwhat the Iranian government would do if he, a U.S.-Iranian citizen, were to travel to Iran to see his\nmother, and his acknowledgment that he must be careful about what he discusses on the phone with\nhis mother when he calls her. \nThe security concerns raised by the foregoing may be mitigated if it can be shown that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign  individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  In light of all of the information about\n21\nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his mother and the nature of Iran\u2019s government and its adverse\nrelationship with the U.S., such mitigation is unavailable to the Applicant. However, because it\nappears his contact or communication with his siblings is casual and infrequent, I conclude there is\nlittle likelihood his relationship with them could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.22\nOn balance, however, available information is insufficient to overcome the security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family in Iran, and I resolve this guideline against Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines B and C. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\n\n \u201c (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\n23\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Directive, 6.3. \n24\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n25\n7\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant is a mature adult, who has lived most of his adult life in this\n23\ncountry. He has worked hard to support his wife and family, and, when faced with financial adversity\nbecause of layoffs, he did what he could to make ends meet. While he has significant ties to the U.S.,\nthe facts herein, particularly those pertaining to Iran, present a significant potential for continued\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and Applicant did not present information to show the\npotential for duress is likely to abate at any time. Accordingly, a fair and commonsense assessment24\nof all available information before me shows that the Applicant has not yet overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s reasonable doubts about his suitability for access to classified information. Because\nprotection of the national interest is of paramount importance, such doubts must be resolved in favor\nof the national security.25\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference):         \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On July 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines J and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 21, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non September 19, 2007.  I received the case assignment on October 1, 2007.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on October 18, 2007, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on November 14, 2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, without objection. The Applicant asked for\nthe record to remain open for a brief period and, on November 26, 2007, he submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nNovember 28, 2007.  The record closed on November 28, 2007. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 30 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\nelectrician and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Applicant has been arrested three times.  The first arrest happened in\nDecember 1995.  On that occasion the Applicant was charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol.  He plead no contest and was sentenced to attend an alcohol\nclass.  He did not attend the class and eventually served 40 days in jail because of his\nfailure.  The Applicant admits that he did not make good decisions at that time, when he\nwas under the age of 20.  (Transcript at 22- 26.)\nBy his own account, the Applicant ran with a rough crowd when he was younger.\nHe had friends at that time who were drug users.  On December 22, 1996, when he was\nonly 19, the Applicant was arrested for Possession of a Controlled Substance.  He was\nstopped by police and a baggie with drug residue was found in his car.  The Applicant\nsuccessfully completed the diversion program he was sentenced to for this offense.  He\nstated that he learned his lesson about doing what the judge tells you to do because of\nhaving to go to jail over his previous arrest.  (Transcript at 26-30.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s last arrest occurred on March 26, 2005.  On that day, a Saturday,\nthe Applicant was helping a former co-worker pack up his truck.  The Applicant and his\nfriend had been drinking and making a lot of noise.  The police were called by neighbors\nand the Applicant\u2019s friend was arrested for Driving Under the Influence.  The Applicant\ninterfered with the police officer by telling his friend not to submit to a breathalyzer and\nhe was arrested for Disorderly Conduct Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs.  The\nApplicant admits that he made a mistake that night in interfering with the police, pleaded\nguilty, and paid a $100 fine.  (Transcript at 30-32, 45-48.)\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Applicant filled out a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) by\nhand on Wednesday, March 23, 2005.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  Question 23 of that form\nasks the Applicant about his police record.  He correctly reported his arrests in 1995\nand 1996 on that form.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 14-15.\n2\nSee, Transcript at 39.\n3\n3\nThe Applicant testified that he turned the form into his supervisor the same day.\nHis supervisor subsequently turned the hand written questionnaire over the main office\nfor typing the next day.  The Applicant further testified:\nOver the weekend I was arrested, I returned to work on Monday\n[March 28, 2005] and I explained to [my supervisor] about the arrest and\nthat I wanted to change the questionnaire.  \n[My supervisor] told me the questionnaire was already being\nprocessed, and that he did not want to stop the process.  So on April 22 ,\nnd\nthe completed, typed forms were sent back to [the work site] for me to\nsign.  This was a typed version of the questionnaire that I had\nhandwritten.1\nI told him then again that I would like to change the statement in\nthat questionnaire.  He told me or actually he pointed out the Privacy Act,\nwhich states that there would be an oral interview, and that I could clear\nup any discrepancies or differences in the questionnaire at that time.   I\n2\nbelieved him.  (Transcript at 35.)  \n3\nGovernment Exhibit 1 is the Security Clearance Application that was submitted to\nthe Government.  As stated, it was signed by the Applicant on April 22, 2005, and does\nnot have reference to the Applicant\u2019s March 26, 2005, arrest under Questions 24 or 26.\nThe Applicant submitted a letter from the President/Facility Security Officer of his\nemployer.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 3.)  This letter confirms that he received a signed\nquestionnaire from the Applicant on March 24, 2005, dated March 23, 2005.\nA letter was also submitted from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC at 4.)  In this letter he states, \u201cI personally handed [the Applicant] his completed\napplication for security clearance positions on 4/22/05.  I advised [the Applicant] to sign\nand date the completed application on 4/22/05.  Previously, [the Applicant] had advised\nme of his arrest record.\u201d\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person.  A Superior Court Judge, a Fire Department Captain, and a State\nemployee all submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  The\nApplicant is described as someone who is \u201cintelligent,\u201d \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d and \u201chonest and\nan asset to society.\u201d\n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in minor criminal incidents in 1995, 1996 and 2005.\nAG \u00b6 31(a) applies to this case, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nThe first two incidents happened when the Applicant was quite young and, by his\nown admission, foolish.  The last occurred because the Applicant got involved in his\nfriend\u2019s arrest, again a foolish act.  The Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that\nhe has learned his lesson from these incidents.  He showed a mature grasp of what\nhappened here, why, and how to avoid it in the future.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, several of the mitigating conditions also\napply and justify a finding for the Applicant as to this Guideline.  They are AG \u00b6 32(a ),\n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 16(a), the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  The Applicant\nsubmitted a Questionnaire to the Government which did not have complete information\nconcerning his arrest record.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially\ndisqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from personal conduct involving falsifications. Under AG \u00b6 17(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts.\u201d  The Applicant testified that his supervisor advised him that he could discuss\nthe 2005 arrest during his interview with a Department of Defense investigator.  This\ninterview took place a year later.  (Transcript at 43-48.)  The evidence is clear that the\nApplicant\u2019s effort to correct the omission in his questionnaire was made in good faith.\nThe obvious question is whether it is \u201cprompt.\u201d  It is certainly arguable that, in this\nparticular case, he was prompt.  The Applicant has never had a security clearance, and\ndoes not have one now.  Therefore, he had no basis of knowledge to know when his\ninterview would take place, and did the best he could to clear up the record when it did\noccur.  However, the application of this mitigating condition is not essential to my\nresolution of this case.\nAs stated above, the Applicant argues that he was following the orders of his\nsupervisor when he signed the questionnaire omitting his 2005 arrest.  AG \u00b6 17(b)\nstates that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe refusal or failure to\ncooperate, omission or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or\ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process.  Upon\nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d  There is considerable evidence, from the\nApplicant and his supervisor, that the Applicant was very open in discussing his arrest\nrecord.  The draft Questionnaire, which he submitted three days before his arrest, was\naccurate.  His supervisor confirms that he advised the Applicant to sign the incorrect\nQuestionnaire, and that he had prior knowledge of the Applicant\u2019s arrest history.  The\nApplicant\u2019s situation falls clearly within the requirements of this mitigating condition and,\nunder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that it is applicable. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n7\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has overcome his earlier minor criminal conduct.  In\nviewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant did not have an intent to\ndeceive the Government when he signed and submitted Government Exhibit 1.  His\nfailure to inform the Government of his 2005 arrest was a fault of timing and improper\ninstruction from his supervisor.  Timing, because he filled out the form mere days before\nthe event.  Based on my analysis of his testimony, the available evidence and his\ndemeanor, I find that he would have told the Government of this arrest in a timely\nmanner if given the opportunity.  Improper instruction, because his supervisor told the\nApplicant that the subject interview would be the appropriate place and time to tell the\nGovernment of his recent criminal conduct.  Until he received the Statement of\nReasons, the Applicant had no reason to believe that his conduct had not been\nappropriate.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), as discussed above, the Applicant followed the incorrect\nadvice of his supervisor in submitting a flawed Questionnaire.  Therefore, I find that his\nconduct was not knowing, in that he did not have an intent to deceive the Government.\nHe well understands what happened and why, and has expressed a credible intent not\nto allow such errors to occur in the future.  Accordingly, I find that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Finally, at the present time, I find\nthat there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG\n\u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nBetween 1995 and 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal conduct on three\nseparate occasions. She is currently on probation for her most recent arrest, and it does not expire\nuntil October 2007. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. She\nanswered the SOR on June 25, 2007, denying two of the three allegations and electing to have the\ncase decided on the written record.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant\non July 19, 2007. She received it on July 24, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She neither objected to any\nof the FORM submissions, nor filed any additional evidence to be considered. The case was assigned\nto me on September 18, 2007 requesting an administrative determination.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old single woman with two adult children. She has a high school\neducation. For the past 25 years she has worked for a defense contractor as an electronics fabricator\n(Exhibit 4 at 1-3). \nOne night in December 1995, Applicant and her boyfriend got into a heated argument in her\napartment. The confrontation escalated after he slapped her, pushed her into a wall, and began\npunching her. She then grabbed a paring knife and stabbed him in the arm leaving a superficial\nwound (Exhibit 5, Crime Report, dated December 24, 1995 at 3). The police responded to an\nanonymous call, took statements from both individuals and charged Applicant with assault with a\ndeadly weapon (Id.). Her boyfriend was then arrested for several outstanding warrants unrelated to\nthe domestic incident. The charge against Applicant was later dismissed after her boyfriend failed\nto appear for two successive pre-trial hearings.\nIn July 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery and exhibiting a deadly\nweapon other than a firearm after her adult daughter alleged she slapped  her and threatened her with\na knife during an argument (Exhibit 6, Police Report, dated July 24, 1999 at 3). Applicant admitted\nslapping her, but denies brandishing a knife. The charges were later dismissed because of insufficient\nevidence.\nIn August 2004, Applicant took her five-year-old granddaughter to a local wine festival. She\ngrew irritated with her after the child expressed a desire to leave. She then grabbed her, squeezing\nher neck and pulling her hair, as she led her from the festival. Several people witnessed this behavior,\n\n3\nand one of them called the police. When the officer arrived, he took a statement from the\ngranddaughter, and observed \u201cred linear bruising on each side of the rear portion of her neck\u201d\n(Exhibit 7, Police Report, dated August 1, 2004). \nApplicant was then arrested and charged with abusing or endangering the health of a child.\nShe was found guilty and sentenced to three years in jail, with all but two days suspended, and three\nyears of probation (Answer). Also, she was ordered to complete community service and parenting\nclasses, ordered to have no contact with her granddaughter, and ordered she not come within 100\nyards of her while the probation is pending. The order expires in October 2007.\nApplicant completed both the parenting classes and the community service, as ordered\n(Answer at 5, 8).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n1\n4\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n1\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J\nBetween 1995 and 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal conduct on three\nseparate occasions. She is currently on probation for her most recent arrest, and it does not expire\nuntil October 2007. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31 (a): a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses, and CC DC 31 (d): individual is currently on parole or probation,\napply.\nCriminal activity does not have to result in a conviction in order to have negative security\nimplications. Nonetheless, I conclude the 1995 incident has little probative value. Applicant\u2019s\naccuser instigated the incident, did not appear for any pre-trial hearings, and had a prior criminal\nrecord.\nThe 1999 charge has similarly limited probative value. It was based on her daughter\u2019s\nallegations, which Applicant denied, and was dismissed because of insufficient evidence. \nThe 2004 charge, however, resulted in a conviction and a sentence to probation which she\nis still serving. Although her completion of community service and parenting classes triggers the\napplication of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 32 (d): there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation, it is insufficient to overcome the security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nWhen viewed in its totality, Applicant has a history of volatile relationships with family\nmembers and loved ones. I was particularly troubled by the immaturity and bad judgment displayed\nin 2004 when she physically abused her granddaughter after getting irritated with her for wanting\nto leave a festival. Consequently, although Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation by completing\ncommunity service and parenting classes, it is too soon to conclude that she can be entrusted with\nclassified information. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n5\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD\nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. He\nanswered the SOR on August 3, 2007, electing to have the case decided on the written\nrecord. \nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to\nApplicant on October 22, 2007. He received it on October 30, 2007. Applicant was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. He submitted a two-page response received by the government on\nNovember 5, 2007. The case was assigned to me on December 13, 2007. Based upon\nJanuary 29, 2008\n\nThe FORM 1149 was signed by a Navy Petty Officer.\n1\n2\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains one allegation referenced under Guidelines K and E.\nApplicant denies that he \u201cfailed to properly secure classified material in an authorized\nmanner in 2003,\" but admits he was \u201ccounseled regarding [his] actions and given a\nwarning\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man. He has no children. He served in the\nU.S. Navy from 1973 through his retirement in 1993 (Item 4 at 2). He has an associate\u2019s\ndegree in forestry/wildlife management earned in 1990.\nSince 1995, he has worked as a project manager at a defense contractor. His\nduties include, among other things, missile system maintenance for Navy ships. The\ndefense contractor maintains two coastal offices on opposite sides of the country.\nApplicant worked in the satellite office located across the country from the main office.\nIn December 2003, Applicant was tasked with overseeing the upgrade of a ship\u2019s\nmissile system. Such projects normally take four weeks to complete (Item 6 at 3). In this\ncase, Applicant only had two weeks to complete the project before the ship deployed.\nThe upgrade project involved removing the obsolete missile system, disassembling it,\nand removing it from the ship. \nThe obsolete missile system consisted of nine components. Eight of its nine\ncomponents were labeled confidential. The ninth component was unlabeled. Typically,\nwhen old, classified components were replaced, the ship\u2019s supply officer was\nresponsible for transferring them to the defense contractor\u2019s main office. In this case,\nthe supply officer was on leave, and Applicant was unaware of any backup transfer\nprocedures (Item 6 at 3). He was afraid that the parts would be lost or misplaced if he\nleft them on the ship after it deployed (Item 6 at 3).\nApplicant decided to transfer the parts himself. He contacted his employer\u2019s main\noffice to request an authorized courier to retrieve the components (Response to FORM,\nat 1). He never received a response. As the deployment date grew nearer, he decided\nto remove the components himself. He wrapped the parts in two separate, small brown\npaper bags, taped and marked them \u201cconfidential,\u201d completed a DD Form 1149, a form\ndocumenting the transfer of government material from the ship\u2019s custody,  and removed\n1\nthe components from the ship (Item 5 at 3). After removing them, he placed them in his\noffice safe which was certified to hold classified items (Response to FORM; Item 6 at 4).\n\n3\nApplicant then contacted his company\u2019s fleet technical support center at the main\noffice for instructions on disposing of the components. Again, he did not receive a\nresponse (Item 6 at 3). \nApproximately eight months later during an annual self-inspection in July 2004,\nApplicant disclosed that he was storing the components in the safe, prompting an\ninvestigation (Item 5 at 1). Before then, he had never informed his supervisor that the\ncomponents were in the safe. Consequently, Applicant was counseled regarding his\nactions and given a warning (Item 3 at 1).\nAccording to the employer\u2019s adverse information report, the components may\nhave been declassified at the time Applicant removed them from the ship (Item 5 at 2,\n\u00b63). There is no record evidence documenting whether this issue was ever resolved.\nThe record evidence regarding whether the material was classified when Applicant\nremoved it from the ship is inconclusive. Absent conclusive evidence of whether the\ncomponents were classified, I accept Applicant\u2019s contention that no compromise of\nclassified information occurred.\nApplicant had never been reprimanded for his work performance before this\nincident. He worked for his employer for another 10 months through May 2005 without\nincident. After briefly being furloughed in March 2006 because of lack of work, he\nreturned in April 2006 to work on another project (Item 6 at 4). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nUnder this guideline, \u201cdeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and\nregulations protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern\u201d (AG \u00b6 33). Here, the SOR alleges\nApplicant failed to secure classified material when removing it from a ship. Applicant\ndenies the allegation, and evidence upon which the government\u2019s allegation is based\n(Item 5) is inconclusive. The government has not met its burden because it failed to\nprove the materials involved were classified. Therefore, I conclude there are no\nGuideline K security concerns.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe government\u2019s failure to establish the components were classified does not\nend the security clearance scrutiny. When he began working on the project, Applicant\nclearly believed the components were classified, yet failed to remove them from the ship\nconsistent with regulations governing the handling of classified material (See generally,\nDoD 5220.22-M \u00b6\u00b6 2-100, 5-100, 5-202, and 5-204). Moreover, although he made two\nrequests for instructions to his main office, and received no response, he reached the\ndecision to store the material in the office safe without informing his immediate\nsupervisor. \n\n5\nThis raises Personal Conduct security concerns. Under this guideline, \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). The disqualifying\ncondition most pertinent to Applicant\u2019s case is AG \u00b6 16 (d)(1), \u201cuntrustworthy or\nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary\ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation.\u201d\nThe incident occurred more than four years ago. Also, he was operating under\nextreme time pressure. Although disposing of obsolete parts was normally not his\nresponsibility, he had to handle the task because the designated supply officer was on\nleave at the time. No compromise of classified information occurred.  Before this\nincident, he had never made any similar judgment lapses while performing his job\nduties, and he has not made any since then. As punishment, he was merely given a\nwarning, and counseled. AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the bevavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nApplicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHere, the nature and seriousness of the conduct were minimal. The material\nApplicant removed from the ship may not have been classified, and there is no evidence\nany compromise occurred. He was merely issued a warning, and allowed to continue\nworking. Moreover, assuming for the sake of argument that the material was classified,\nApplicant, by removing it from the ship before it deployed, and later attempting to\ncontact his company\u2019s fleet technician, was performing his job duties in a good-faith\nmanner. \n\n6\nThe unique nature of these circumstances renders the likelihood of recurrence\nminimal. Applicant was working on a short deadline, and was faced with an\nunanticipated situation, because the supply officer, who normally disposed of the\nobsolete equipment, was on leave. Although he probably should have contacted his\nsupervisor before removing the items, or at minimum, talked with him after the removal,\nhe had never committed such judgment lapses in the past, and has not committed any\nsince the incident. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\n1\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn April 24, 2008, Applicant requested a hearing on the matter. In response to\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations regarding criminal conduct, denied the\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n2\nallegations regarding financial concerns, and did not provide an answer regarding\npersonal conduct. Applicant\u2019s request for a hearing was received on May 22, 2008, and\nI was assigned the case on May 28, 2008. Applicant and Department Counsel\nproposed a hearing date of July 1, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on June 13,\n2008, setting the hearing for that date. Due to a scheduling conflict, a notice was issued\non July 2, 2008, setting the hearing for July 10, 2008.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered six exhibits,\nwhich were accepted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) 1-6 without objection. Applicant\nrepresented herself and gave testimony; no witnesses were called. She offered seven\nexhibits, which were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-G. The record\nwas held open through July 28, 2008, to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement\nthe record. A 20 page facsimile transmission was received on July 18, 2008, from\nApplicant. It consisted of a cover letter and select pages from her credit report. On July\n22, 2008, the Government submitted a letter in which it declined to object to Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission. The submission was accepted into the record as Ex. H. In the interim, the\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on July 18, 2008. The record was closed on July 30, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior financial assistant working for a defense\ncontractor. She has worked for the same contractor for the past three years. Applicant\nis married and has two adult children from a prior marriage. She has completed\napproximately two and one-half years of college. \nFrom 1976 through 2000, Applicant worked for the Federal government and\nmaintained a security clearance. During this same time period, Applicant\u2019s first marriage\nsoured. She divorced her first husband in 1985, but she neglected to remove his name\nfrom her bank account. On three occasions between November 1987 and April 1989,\nApplicant wrote checks on her account which were returned for insufficient funds. This\nwas the result of her ex-husband withdrawing funds from her account without her\nknowledge, thus reducing her available balance. Consequently, she was thrice arrested,\ncharged, and convicted of passing a bad check. When Applicant\u2019s ex-husband later\nwent to court for committing domestic violence, the bank corroborated that it was\nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s withdrawals that reduced Applicant\u2019s bank balances sufficiently\nto cause the three checks to be returned.\nIn 2000, Applicant moved to a new state. The move was costly and money was\ntight. In submitting her reimbursements to the Government for the balance owed on her\nlease, she inflated the balance she said she owed her apartment complex. Additionally,\nthe receipts offered the Government for housing reimbursement in her new state of\nresidence were higher than the actual costs she expended. As a result, Applicant was\ncharged and convicted of Filing a False Claim and Theft of Government Property.\nApproximately $15,000 in restitution was sought by the Government. Applicant pled\nguilty. In August 2000, she was sentenced to 30 days of incarceration, five years of\nsupervised probation, and ordered to make restitution. \n\n Tr. 45-46.\n2\n Tr. 45; 48.\n3\n Tr. 26-27.\n4\n Tr. 27.\n5\n \u201cThey forgot that I was supposed to go on a work release.\u201d Id.\n6\n Ex.

H, supra, at 4.\n8\n Attachment to the SOR Answer, Bank letter, dated March 14, 2005.\n9\n3\nAt the suggestion of her attorney, Applicant resigned her government position\nthe week before her sentence was passed.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor did not want her to\n2\nresign. When it was clear that was Applicant\u2019s intent, the supervisor referred Applicant\nto a particular government contractor in the private sector. Thus referred, that employer\nhired Applicant within two weeks after she left government service.  For the most part,\n3\nshe has worked for various government contractors on different projects off and on\nsince that time. \nWhen it came time to serve her 30 days, Applicant had not heard from the\ncorrections department. Her entry date apparently had been miscalculated. She helped\nfacilitate her immediate processing because she wanted to fulfill her sentence\nexpeditiously and get her life back on track.  To that end, she took a \u201cproactive\n4\napproach to mending and straightening [her] life out.\u201d  She served her term in prison in\n5\nOctober 2000 without incident. After her release, she helped facilitate her own timely\ntransition into a work release program.  Restitution was aggressively and regularly\n6\nmade in larger than necessary amounts. She struggled to make larger payments to\nexpedite the repayment of the amount owed the court. The full amount was repaid\nearly, with payments completed before or by April 2005. Her period of supervised\nprobation was promptly terminated in August 2005 with all requirements timely\ncompleted.  \n7\nDuring Applicant\u2019s incarceration, a $126.00 bill from her cable company went\nunpaid. The account became delinquent, but was ultimately discovered and paid off by\nApplicant in 2004.  The following year, in March 2005, Applicant similarly paid off the\n8\nfull balance owed on a delinquent credit card with a balance of $7,350.00.9\nApplicant remarried in 2006. Her husband\u2019s salary was used, in part, to pay their\nmonthly mortgage. Between February and June of 2007, Applicant\u2019s husband was out\nof work due to an on-the-job injury. Following his accident, it took several months for his\nWorker\u2019s Compensation payments to be processed and paid. As a consequence, they\nbecame delinquent on their mortgage. Showing the mortgage company that Worker\u2019s\nCompensation would be forthcoming, however, their lender worked with them and\n\n Ex.

The account was brought up to date in October 2007.\nToday, the payments are up to date. There is no past due amount owed to the\nmortgagor.10\nApplicant regrets what she did in the past, looks at her past legal transgressions\nas a \u201clife lesson,\u201d and is committed to moving forward in the future and not let such\nthings happen again.  She has made a conscious effort to turn her life around and to\n11\ndemonstrate that openly.  As a result, over the past eight years, she has made\n12\nsubstantial changes in the manner she conducts her affairs. Although her ex-husband\nis no longer on her bank account, she does not write a check unless she is sure there is\nmore than sufficient funds to cover it and any other outstanding withdrawals.  She has\n13\nlearned the importance of working with creditors and living within one\u2019s means.  She\n14\nreceived financial counseling, is currently living within her means, and is saving money\nfor the future. \nNow active with a local church, Applicant became an integral part of its outreach\nprogram following her incarceration. That program gives counseling to those in trouble\nand those who are in debt, teaching them that they need not resort to crime to make\nit.  Instead, they emphasize job training, She openly shares her story with, and offers\n15\nher insights to, participants and youth groups.  Through this church group, in 2003, she\n16\nmet her current husband. Together, they started their own partnership with a national\ncharitable organization through their church.  The partnership has been hugely\n17\nsuccessful, owing in great part to Applicant\u2019s leadership and efforts within the\ncommunity.  It redistributes donations to those in need and it has a food bank, through\n18\nwhich recipients can also find referrals to escape or avoid homelessness.  It also\n19\nprovides confidential aid and outreach to battered women. Her commitment to their\norganization has demanded a great deal of her personal time. She is noted for her\nabilities as a counselor and a trusted confidante to those in crisis.20\n\n Ex. B (Professional Reference Letter of June 25, 2008).\n21\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n22\n Department of the Navy v.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n24\n5\nAt work, Applicant is held in high regard and known for providing good work for\nthe company\u2019s government customers.  Her employer acknowledges the underlying\n21\nfacts in this case and notes no suspicions or concerns regarding her trustworthiness. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n23\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n24\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\n\n Id.\n25\n Id.\n26\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n27\n6\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n25\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n26\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n27\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) are the most pertinent to the evaluation of the\nfacts in this case:\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits she was thrice\ncited and convicted for passing a bad check in the 1980s. She also admits she pled\nguilty to Filing a False Claim and Theft of Government Property during the summer of\n2000. Such conduct and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns, and\ninvoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted, or convicted).\nThe bad check convictions occurred about two decades ago and bear little\nrelevance to any subsequent activity. Moreover, the facts indicate that the insufficiency\nof funds in Applicant\u2019s bank account was due not to any intent on her part to defraud,\nbut to her ex-husband\u2019s continued, unauthorized, and unknown access to her bank\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n28\n7\naccount. Consequently, these instances are not only dated in the past, but were\ncreated  through unique facts unlikely to recur in the futures. As for the false claim and\ntheft of government property, Applicant admitted the charges and pled guilty. That was\nover eight years ago. Since then she has not only served her sentence and made full\nrestitution, but she has returned to work within the government contractor community\nwith a solid and praised record, devoted numerous hours to community service, and\nregularly uses her own life as an example to discuss human weakness, incarceration,\nand the ability to turn one\u2019s life around. Taken together, Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) applies.\nIndeed, Applicant\u2019s desire for complete rehabilitation even after her release from\nincarceration over eight years ago is impressive. Recognizing a need to give back to\nher community and understanding that sharing her own story with others could help her\nsteer others away from crime, Applicant has since been selfless with both her time and\nher energy. Her community service is impressive. Equally impressive are her genuine\nand credible expressions of contrition, her expedited restitution, and the passage of\ntime without recurrence of any dubious actions or financial problems. Consequently, CC\nMC AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d) applies. \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nA failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this\n28\nguideline.  \nWhile briefly incarcerated in 2000 and as her husband was awaiting Workman\u2019s\nCompensation in 2007, two of Applicant\u2019s accounts became delinquent and her\nmortgage became overdue. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. With such conditions raised, the\nburden shifts to Appellant to address the case against her and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nApplicant was not married when she was incarcerated in 2000. During her\nabsence from home, she lost track of some accounts which ultimately went unpaid.\n\n Additionally, refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions in connection with a\n29\npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative determination of further processing for clearance eligibility.\n8\nSpecifically, a telecommunications account and a credit card became delinquent.\nHowever, both accounts were paid in full prior to the issuance of the February 2008\nSOR. Moreover, when Applicant\u2019s husband was injured on the job in 2007, he could not\nwork. The temporary loss of his income impacted family finances. The delay in receipt\nof Workman\u2019s Compensation made them late on their mortgage payments. By October\n2007, however, the arrearage was repaid and the account was back in good standing.\nOnce again, corrective action was taken before the SOR was issued in 2008. \nBoth instances were situations where Applicant had limited or no control. In\nneither set of facts was Applicant\u2019s response to her situation reckless or irresponsible.\nBoth bills were ultimately paid within a reasonable amount of time \u2013 and well before the\nissuance of the SOR. Based on these facts, Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.\nFurther, the telecom and credit card delinquencies were both satisfied by 2005.\nLike the late mortgage, those debts became late because of unique facts and\ncircumstances over which Applicant had no control. Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\napplies. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s innate knack for budgeting, which helped her repay her\nrestitution sum in an expedited manner, and the knowledge gleaned from financial\ncounseling assured that her debts were addressed long before the issuance of the\n2008 SOR. As a consequence, security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s finances had\nbeen put to rest long before the SOR was issued. Therefore, FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) and FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) apply. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arising from matters of personal conduct are controlled by\nGuideline E of the AG. Such security concerns arise in the presence of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations which could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.29\nWith regard to the three bad checks from the 1980s, there is no indication that\nApplicant knew she was passing along checks her bank account could not cover.\n\n9\nIndeed, the facts tend to indicate that it was Applicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s covert use of her\nbank account that led to there being deficient funds in the account. Consequently, these\nthree events from the distant past bear no adverse impact on Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, reliability, or honesty today.\nIn padding her moving expenses while seeking reimbursement from the\nGovernment \nin \n2000, \nhowever, \nApplicant \ndemonstrated \npoor \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, and a lack of candor. Such facts give rise to Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any\nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information) and AG \u00b616(d)\n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\nand may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when\ncombined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information).\nApplicant\u2019s padding of her moving expenses was not a recent transgression. It\noccurred in the summer of 2000 \u2013 over eight years ago. Moreover, this isolated incident\nwas unique and atypical when considered within the full span of Applicant\u2019s personal\nand professional life, both before and after her incarceration. Indeed, it stands out in\nstark and singular contrast to the over two decades of Government service that\npreceded it and the eight years of private sector employment and volunteerism that\nsucceeded it. Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nFurthermore, from the time Applicant\u2019s expense report padding was exposed to\nthe present, she has actively and diligently worked to pay for her misdeed and make up\nfor her transgression. Rather than fight the charges, she pled guilty. She prodded the\nsystem to let her serve her time and to transition to work release in a timely manner.\nShe expedited payment of her restitution. Applicant has since devoted her free time to\nher church and community charity, providing counseling and often using her own story\nas a morality tale to discourage contacts from turning to crime. She helped start her\nown community support service through her church with her husband. Eight years after\nher conviction, Applicant is a trusted employee, admired wife, active church organizer,\ntireless volunteer, and respected member of her community. She has achieved this\nlevel not by keeping her past a secret, but by sharing her past and demonstrating how\none can rise above one\u2019s past. Such facts give rise to PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress).\n\n10\nWhole Person Concept\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s\nhighly credible testimony. She is a mature, direct, and candid individual with a fine work\nrecord and a notable record for community service. A \u201cwhole person\u201d evaluation was\nalso conducted.\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s expense report padding was a blatant disregard of the rules and laws\ngoverning her employment. It was also an isolated incident. It appears to have been\nmotivated not by a dire financial need, but by a sense that she could \u201cwork the system.\u201d\nShe took a chance, she lost, and she continues to express her regret. On the other\nhand, this singular instance of reckless behavior and poor judgment occurred over eight\nyears ago. Since that time she has completed her sentence, paid her dues to society,\nand made full restitution. Both her words of contrition and her explanation as to how\nshe has tried to pay society back for her transgression are heartfelt. They are also\nreflected in the good works she has performed within her community for over eight\nyears. In sharing her experiences with others, she provides a potent example of both\nthe costs of criminal behavior and the ability to self-rehabilitate. There is no evidence\nthat Applicant will ever again resort to such behavior. As for her financial situation, the\nfacts show that she addressed the accounts at issue well before the issuance of the\nSOR and that her financial footing has been restored.\nApplicant is aware that her crime was one which flagrantly violated the law and\ndemonstrated foolish judgment. It is, however, a singular instance of an adverse\nvolitional act within the context of a career spanning over 30 years. The Applicant of\ntoday has demonstrably learned from her experience. Taken together, her genuine\ncontrition, her earnest efforts toward rehabilitation, and the passage of over eight years\nhelp restore her reputation and trustworthiness. In depicting her rehabilitation, Applicant\nhas further mitigated security concerns raised from her past financial and criminal\nactivity. In light of the whole person presented and security concerns, I conclude that it\nis clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Clearance denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 26 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct.  He answered the SOR 14 May 2007, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. However, Department Counsel requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me\n5 July 2007, and I convened a hearing 24 August 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 4\nSeptember 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for \u00b6\u00b61.b., 1.d., and 2.a., each of which he\ndenied because he claims he did not use cocaine in January 2006. Accordingly, I incorporate his\nadmissions as findings of fact. He is a 33-year-old consultant employed by defense contractors since\nDecember 2000. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained in approximately January 2005\nWhen Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in March 2003 (G.E. 1),  he answered\n\u201cyes\u201d to question 25 (military police record, last seven years), and disclosed a non-judicial\npunishment he received in January 1999.  He also answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 25 (illegal drug use,\nlast seven years), and disclosed that he had used LSD five times between January 1998 and January\n1999, cocaine five times between February 1999 and March 2002, and ecstacy ten time between\nJanuary 2001 and January 2002. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in\nDecember 2003 (G.E. 3) and confirmed the listed drug abuse, stated his intent to refrain from future\ndrug abuse, and was ultimately granted his clearance. During his interview, he confirmed that he\nusually bought the drugs he used in social settings.\nIn March 2006, Applicant executed a second clearance application (G.E. 2).  He answered\n\u201cyes\u201d to question 27 (illegal drug use, last seven years), and disclosed that he had used ecstasy ten\ntimes between January 2001 and January 2002, and had used cocaine six times between February\n1999 and January 2006. During an October 2006 subject interview (G.E. 4), Applicant stated he had\nnot used any illegal drugs in the last two years. However, government investigators could not resolve\nthe discrepancy, and he was re-interviewed in December 2006 (G.E. 4). He then stated\u2014among\nseveral inconsistent answers\u2014that he could have used cocaine in January 2006. \nApplicant attributes the discrepancy in his stated dates of last cocaine use to his perceived\npressure from government investigators to provide more exact dates. He attributes the January 2006\ndate of cocaine use on his March 2006 application to a typographical error. He insists that he has\nnot used illegal drugs since the 2002 dates reported on his March 2003 clearance application.\nHowever, I found his testimony equivocal, evasive, and without credibility. Further, he provided no\ncharacter evidence to support his claims that he no longer associates with the social contacts with\nwhom he used drugs. \n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ; (c) any illegal drug use\n3\nafter being granted a security clearance; \nI reject Applicant\u2019s claim that the January 2006 cocaine use reported by Applicant on his March 2006\n4\nclearance application was a typographical error, for several reasons. First, I infer that Applicant had a copy of his\nMarch 2003 clearance available for reference, as he provided a partial copy of this application in his answer. Second,\nthe record evidence shows Applicant took some care in updating his March 2006 clearance application, as he deleted\nhis non-judicial punishment and his LSD use from the application\u2014both being now more than seven years past.\nFinally, in updating his cocaine use, he changed the date of last use from March 2002 to January 2006, and he\n3\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,  and Applicant\n3\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns. In reaching these conclusions, I find that Applicant used\ncocaine as late as January 2006, contrary to his answer and his claims at hearing.  His use and\n4\n\nchanged the number of times used from five to six. I think it unlikely that both changes would be typographical\nerrors. Further, I think it highly likely that Applicant would remember his January 2006 drug use when completing a\nclearance application in March 2006. In addition, Applicant conceded he could have used cocaine in January 2006\nduring his December 2006 subject interview.\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n5\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period of\n6\nabstinence;\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n7\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\npurchase of various illegal drugs between January 1998 and January 2006 are neither distant in time\nor infrequent.  His abstinence from drug use\u2014just over 18 months\u2014is inadequate to demonstrate\n5\nan intent to refrain from drug use in the future.  I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal\n6\ndrugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant\ndid not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately misrepresented his date of last illegal drug use\nto the government.  He did so after apparently disclosing that date correctly on his March 2006\n7\nclearance application. However, his misrepresentation in October 2006, and his subsequent\nequivocations in December 2006, tended to affect the direction of the government\u2019s investigation.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nIn terms of a whole person analysis, Applicant\u2019s conduct raised serious concerns about his\nfitness for access to classified information. Consequently, he had a heavy burden to establish that\nhe was otherwise eligible for access notwithstanding the adverse information documented in the\nrecord. However, aside from his continued denials of illegal drug use after January 2002, he offered\nno evidence of his work record, no character references, and no evidence of changed circumstances\nor lifestyle that I might reasonably rely on to surmount the adverse information and grant him access\nto classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He was convicted of several charges based on\nhim having sexual relations with two female recruits under his command. Applicant\u2019s overall\nconduct and reputation, both before and after those offenses, is exemplary. Clearance is\ngranted.\nOn December 30, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a single security concern under Guideline E (personal conduct). On\nJanuary 13, 2011, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR in which he denied the SOR\nallegation and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 24, 2011\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 22, 2011. A notice of hearing was issued\non April 5, 2011, scheduling the hearing for April 26, 2011. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified, called three character witnesses, and submitted one documentary exhibit\ncontaining 24 tabs, that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) 1. Department Counsel\u2019s\nobjection to the admission of the psychological evaluation contained in AE 1, tab B, was\noverruled except to the opinion contained in that evaluation concerning Applicant\u2019s\nqualification to hold a security clearance. The transcript was received on May 4, 2011.   \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old man who has been employed by a succession of defense\ncontractors to train soldiers at an Army Reserve Center since June 1998. He served on\nactive duty in the Army from September 1983, until he was sentenced to be discharged\nwith a Bad Conduct Discharge in February 1998, and placed on appellate leave. Applicant\nwas awarded a bachelor of arts degree in business administration in December 2003.\nApplicant possessed a security clearance from about 1983 until issuance of the SOR in this\ncase. No prior action was ever instituted to revoke or downgrade Applicant\u2019s clearance for\nadverse reasons, and there has been no allegation ever made that he compromised or\nrisked the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant was first married in November 1986. That marriage ended in divorce in\nJune 1994. He remarried in May 1997, and that marriage ended in divorce in June 2001.\nHe has been married a third time since March 2005. Applicant has three adult children and\none infant child. \nApplicant\u2019s military career from 1983 until 1998 included assignments with airborne\nunits, chemical companies, an infantry battalion, and as an instructor at several schools.\nHis personal awards include three Army Commendation Medals, two Army Achievement\nMedals, four Good Conduct Medals, a Parachutist Badge, a Belgian Armed Forces\nParachutist Badge, and the Kuwait Liberation Medal. The many certificates of achievement\nand course completion he submitted indicate Applicant was an excellent soldier until he\ncommitted the offenses that resulted in his court-martial. He was a staff sergeant at the\ntime of the court-martial. The only prior blemish in his record was nonjudicial punishment\nhe received in June 1985, for missing a formation, for which he was awarded a suspended\nreduction in rank.  \nOn February 5, 1998, Applicant was convicted by members at a special court-martial\nof two specifications of adultery, one specification of sodomy, three specifications of\nviolating a lawful general order, and one specification of making a false official statement.\nAll of these charges, except the charge of violating a lawful general order, arose from\nApplicant\u2019s engaging in consensual sexual relations with two female recruits under his\ncommand when he was assigned as their drill instructor. The violation of a lawful general\norder arose from a lewd statement Applicant made to a third recruit under his command.\n\n3\nThe only sentence imposed by the court-martial was to award Applicant a Bad\nConduct Discharge. The sentence was approved by the Convening Authority on July 7,\n1998, but was not executed pending appellate review. The Army Court of Criminal Appeals\naffirmed the findings and sentence on March 29, 2001. The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces affirmed the decision of the Army Court of Criminal Appeals on July\n23, 2002, and its mandate was issued on August 22, 2002. The Army ordered the Bad\nConduct Discharge executed on September 25, 2003. However, and inexplicably, Applicant\nwas not actually issued the Bad Conduct Discharge until July 28, 2010. Applicant was\nissued a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD 214) on July 28, 2010,\nwhich records his date of entry on active duty as September 30, 1983, his separation date\nas July 28, 2010, and his net active service as 26 years, 9 months, and 29 days. \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation providing the following information,\nopinions, and recommendations:\n- AE 1, tab G: An Army lieutenant colonel (promotable) who has known\nApplicant since 1998, and observed his work performance almost daily since\n2004, considers him to be an exemplary person of the highest caliber. She\nopines that Applicant is trustworthy, mature, and possesses excellent\njudgment. She wrote that he is \u201csmart, articulate, and well-grounded.\u201d She\nstrongly recommends that Applicant be granted a security clearance.        \n- AE 1, tab H: An individual who worked with Applicant as a Battle Simulation\nInstructor from 1998 to 2002, and who has maintained a friendship with him\nsince, considers Applicant to be professional and inspirational Christian who\nprovides motivation and encouragement to others.\n- AE 1, tab I: An Army major who has known Applicant for 11 years considers\nApplicant a trustworthy person who can be counted on to do what is right. He\nwrote that Applicant \u201cis known as the Subject Matter Expert (SME) on the\nArmy Battle Command Systems (ABCS)\u201d, and that Applicant\u2019s opinion is\nalways sought on how to use, train, or employ the ABCS.\n- AE 1, tab J: An individual who has known Applicant since 2004, wrote that\nApplicant \u201calways did what was right and there was never a case of\nindiscretion, moral turpitude or lack of trustworthiness.\u201d He personally trusts\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cjudgment, honesty, and integrity emphatically.\u201d\n- AE 1, tab K: A police officer who has known Applicant for 24 years opines\nthat Applicant is trustworthy, honest, and loyal. He recommends that\nApplicant be granted a security clearance.\n- AE 1, tab L: A retired Army lieutenant colonel who has known Applicant for\n11 years, and who has had almost daily contact with him in the workplace,\nhas found Applicant to be an excellent, hardworking, and dependable worker.\nHe opines that Applicant is honest and trustworthy, and he highly\nrecommends that Applicant be granted a security clearance.\n\n4\n- AE 1, tab M: The Deputy Brigade Commander from 1999-2003 for the\ncommand where Applicant works had frequent contact with him during that\ntime period and has maintained contact with him since. He found Applicant\nto be the type of employee who embraced \u201cthe Army core values of loyalty,\nduty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage.\u201d He\nvouches that Applicant \u201cearned the highest respect and admiration from the\ncommanding general and other senior principals throughout the organization\nand units supported throughout the command\u2019s area of responsibility.\u201d  \nThe individuals who authored the letters of recommendation identified as AE 1, tabs I, L,\nand M, also testified at the hearing that they were aware of the reason why Applicant was\ncourt-martialed and discharged from the Army. \nApplicant submitted performance appraisals from his employer that establish he\nroutinely meets or exceeds all job requirements. The certificates of training he submitted\ndemonstrate that Applicant continuously seeks to improve himself and enhance his value\nto his employer. \nIn 2003, Applicant helped establish the church of which he is a member. He was\nelected to serve in a leadership position as a Ruling Elder of the church in 2009. Applicant\u2019s\nwife submitted a letter in which she wrote about his work with the church that has included\nvolunteering as the church administrator, developing computer graphics and sound for\nworship services, setting up ministry teams, and teaching Sunday school and small group\nclasses.  \nApplicant provided Affidavits on November 9, 2007, and June 9, 2010, to\ninvestigators from the Office of Personnel Management in which he denied committing the\noffenses of which he was convicted at the court-martial. He testified he did not want to\nprovide a statement to those investigators because it was his understanding the appellate\nproceedings of his court-martial were still pending. However, he was told by the investigator\nthat he had to provide a statement as part of the process for him to obtain a security\nclearance. He admitted providing the false statements at the hearing and admitted,\nsomewhat begrudgingly, that he committed the offenses for which he was convicted.\nApplicant testified that he obtained counseling from an Army chaplain before and\nafter his court-martial and from a civilian counselor in about 2007. He obtained a\npsychological evaluation for presentation at the hearing that included a range of\npsychological testing. Overall, the testing revealed that Applicant is a normally adjusted and\nhealthy individual devoid of any at-risk sexual behaviors. His self-reported history, clinical\npresentation, and test results did not suggest any form of mental illness. He was found to\nbe psychologically healthy and stable. There was no Axis I or Axis II diagnosis.    \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Clearance decisions\nmust be fair and impartial decisions that are based upon relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6\n\n2 ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n3 ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4 Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at 3 (citations omitted).\n6 ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at 2.\n7 ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9 Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10 Id. at 531.\n11 Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n5\nof the Directive. While the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or\nagainst clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline E\n(personal conduct), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.2 The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.3 The burden of\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.5 \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\nevidence.\u201d6 Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.7 Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance9 and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d10  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.11     \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest\n\n6\nis any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (AG 15)\nIn February 1998, Applicant was convicted by members at a special court-martial\nof various offenses and sentenced to be discharged with a Bad Conduct Discharge. His\noffenses consisted of engaging in consensual sexual conduct with two female recruits\nunder his command, and making lewd remarks to a third female recruit. His convictions and\nsentence were affirmed by the Army Court of Criminal Appeals in 2001, and the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in 2002. Appellant was finally issued the Bad\nConduct Discharge in July 2010. Applicant\u2019s offenses, committed while he was serving as\na drill instructor, were a serious violation of the trust that was placed in him by the Army.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct, at the time it was committed, warranted application of\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment or information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as\n(1) engaging in activities which, if known may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional,\nor community standing. . . . However, his conviction at a court-martial of those offenses,\nand his disclosure of the underlying conduct to at least some of his coworkers negates its\npresent applicability.\nApplicant\u2019s 1998 criminal conduct, combined with the false statements he provided\nin 2007 and 2010, warrants application of DC 16(d): credible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of: (2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior\nin the workplace.  \nApplicant has worked at the same Army Reserve Center for a succession of defense\ncontractors since June 1998. He has earned a reputation for being a hardworking employee\nand a subject matter expert. People who know him well and have worked with him for many\nyears, including senior Army officers, vouch for his honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and\noverall integrity. Many of them specifically recommend that Applicant be granted a security\nclearance.\nApplicant had a very successful Army career before he committed the offenses that\nresulted in the court-martial. His only prior offense was a relatively minor charge for missing\na formation that was adjudicated at a nonjudicial punishment at which he was awarded a\nsuspended reduction in rank. The awards he received and the certificates he submitted\nestablish that he was a professional and dedicated soldier.\nApplicant sought counseling from an Army chaplain at the time of his court-martial\nand from a civilian therapist a number of years later. He obtained a psychological\nevaluation for submission at the hearing that indicates he is a mentally healthy and stable\nperson who is devoid of any mental disease of defect. Applicant has been happily married\n\n7\nsince 2005, and he and his wife have an infant child. Applicant is active in his church where\nhe was elected to a leadership position in 2009.  \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: MC 17(c): . . . so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; MC 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused the untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and MC 17(e): the individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nThe false information Applicant provided in the affidavits he submitted in 2007 and\n2010 is of concern. However, it is understandable how he would not want to admit he\ncommitted criminal conduct while he reasonably believed the appellate process was\ncontinuing from his court-martial. Having most certainly been instructed by his military\nattorney to not discuss the case with anyone, Applicant found himself placed between the\nproverbial \u201crock and a hard-place\u201d when he was told he had to provide a statement that,\nif he admitted he committed the criminal conduct, could be used against him in a retrial if\none were ordered. On balance, and considering these unique circumstance and the whole-\nperson concept, Applicant\u2019s falsifications are not sufficient to negate the effect of the\nmitigating conditions that exist.  \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole-person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant mitigated the personal\nconduct security concern. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate\nburden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 13, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on January 15, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 23,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for February 13, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant\npresented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  The Applicant also\ntestified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until February 23, 2008, to allow\n\n2\nthe Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  She did not submit any\nadditional documentation.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on February 27,\n2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 52 years old and has a Masters Degree in Biology.  She is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Computer Consultant and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nIn 1986, the Applicant and her husband started their own computer consulting\nbusiness that they ran out of their house.  From 1986 through 1998, they had an\naccountant who prepared their tax returns, but did not do a good job.  The Applicant\nclaims that their business expenses were significantly underestimated and so they are\nnow being held liable for this situation.  From 1987 until 1994, the Applicant worked full\ntime for another company.  In 1994, she started doing independent consulting\nexclusively for her own business.  In approximately 1996/1997, the Applicant learned\nthat they had serious tax problems and she took over the financial responsibilities of the\ncompany.  Since then, she has been trying to resolve their tax problems. Additional tax\nproblems surfaced following 9/11 when the Applicant was unemployed for eighteen\nmonths.    \nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the\namount of $188,788.49 in taxes, penalties and interest for tax years 1992 through 1997.\nNotices of federal tax liens were filed against her in 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001 for non-\npayment of her federal income tax debt.  (See Government Exhibit 5).  \nThe Applicant also admits that she is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in\nthe amount of $67,180.04 in taxes, penalties and interest for tax years 2001 and 2003.\n(See Government Exhibit 5).\nThe Applicant denies that she is indebted to the California Franchise Tax Board\nin the amount of $6,716.17.  She has set up a payment plan and has been making\nregular monthly payments towards her indebtedness.  She currently owes\napproximately  $2,171.72, and has only eleven payments left until she has paid the debt\nin full.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \n\n3\nIn numerous conversations with the IRS, it was suggested to the Applicant that\nshe sell her home which has sufficient equity to pay her delinquent federal tax debt.\nThe Applicant did not find this to be a reasonable solution because of her two adult\nchildren who come to visit from time to time, and because she maintains two offices and\nnetworks of computers in her home.\nIn March 2005, the Applicant made an offer and compromise of $50,000.00 cash\nto resolve all of her delinquent federal tax issues.  This offer was rejected.  Since then,\nover the past two and a half years, the Applicant has been trying to get the IRS to\nreconsider her original offer and compromise or place her on a payment plan.  She has\nmet with an IRS representative on several occasions and she has provided them the\nrequested documentation.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  She is currently awaiting a\nresponse.  She has not spoken to any one from the IRS since September 2007.  The\nApplicant has even secured a promise of a mortgage loan from a lender to show the\nIRS that she had the funds immediately available to start paying on the debt.\nThe Applicant was told by the IRS at one time that because her indebtedness\nwas so large, no one agent had the authority to handle it.  (Tr. p. 65).  She was also told\nthat by the end of September 2007, her tax indebtedness would have increased to\napproximately $350,000.00.  (Tr. p. 63).\nSince the Applicant started taking over the financial side of the business, she has\nbeen paying their taxes in full each year and has recently started making quarterly tax\npayments.  They have also hired a competent accountant in order to prevent future tax\nproblems.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n\n5\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nSince 1996/1997, the Applicant has known about her serious tax delinquencies.\nOver the years, the penalties and interest have continued to accrue, increasing her tax\nliability.  Although she states that she has been consistently working to resolve these\nissues, it is clear that she has not been as diligent as she should have.  She presently\nowes, from her own admission, approximately $350,000.00 in delinquent federal tax\ndebt.  Her offer and compromise of $50,000.00 was not acceptable to the IRS.  She has\nnot made one payment toward resolving her enormous federal tax liability.  With regard\nto her delinquent state tax, she is currently making payments toward the debt and has\nreduced it, and plans to continue to pay it until it is paid off in full.  However, she has not\nstarted to reduce her delinquent federal tax debt and has a long way to go before it is\nresolved.  At the present time, she has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate\na track record of financial responsibility or that she has resolved her financial\nindebtedness.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced\n\n6\npersuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome\nthe Government's case. \n \nUpon review of her financial statement, it appears that she has some disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay her delinquent federal tax debt.  However, given\nthe large amount of  federal tax debt that she owes, and the fact that she has not yet\nmade even one payment toward the debt, there is little evidence of financial\nrehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her\nfinancial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not\ninitiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\nhis debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 4, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 22, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing on June 12, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-\n5, which were received with Applicant\u2019s stipulation. Applicant testified on his own behalf.\nHe submitted Exhibit (AE) A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nJune 27, 2008\n\n2\nhearing (Tr.) on June 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 4, 2008, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e of the SOR. Applicant provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1968. After high school, he attended college for a period of time. He\nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1975 and received an honorable discharge in 1980.\nApplicant married in 1978 but his marriage ended in divorce in 1992. He has one child\nas a result of that marriage. He remarried in 1993 and divorced in 2000 (Tr. 19). He is\ncurrently single. He held a security clearance from 1975 through 2002. (GE 1). He\ncurrently holds an interim top secret clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s career with defense contractors spans more than 21 years with one\ncompany (from November 1980 until October 2002). In 2001, Applicant was promoted\nfrom production test lead, a non-exempt payroll position, to systems engineer which\nwas an exempt payroll position. He was assigned the night shift and Applicant claimed\nthat his supervisor permitted him to leave early if the work assignments were completed\n(Tr. 21). However, he received disciplinary actions due to complaints about his work\nperformance in 2002. Specifically, the company reviewed time records and found a\nsignificant overstatement of time worked during a time frame of two months. After two\ncounseling sessions, Applicant was terminated from his long-time employment with the\ncompany, effective October 18, 2002 (GE 3).\nIn 2001, Applicant was dating a woman. He claimed that he terminated the\nrelationship. She filed charges against him for rape in April 2001. He was arrested and\ncharged with the following counts: rape of a drugged victim, rape- incapable of consent,\nsodomy, and oral copulation (GE 5). The case was not prosecuted. Applicant posted\nbond and he never appeared in court (Tr. 26). He admits that he was embarrassed\nabout answering this question (Tr. 52).\nApplicant was unemployed from October 2002 until May 2004. He applied for\nand received unemployment benefits during that time. In 2004, Applicant worked as a\nproduction manager for a company. However, he was again unemployed in November\n2004 until approximately January 2005.\nApplicant has been fully employed since 2005. He began his current employment\nin August 2005. When Applicant applied for this position in July 2005, he completed his\nemployment history in his application. He reported that the reason for leaving his prior\nemployment of 21 years was due to a \u201clayoff.\u201d He signed and certified that his\nemployment application information was true and correct (GE 4).\n\n3\nOn September 21, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In\nsection 22 - your employment record - he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question concerning any\ntermination from employment or leaving employment under unfavorable conditions. \nApplicant answered interrogatories in January 2008 as part of his security\ninvestigation. He stated that he was laid off from his position in 2002 due to \u201cleast\nseniority.\u201d He further explained in his answer to question eight in that same interrogatory\nthat he did not list his prior unfavorable termination because he collected unemployment\ninsurance due to a reduction in force. He stated that his claim was never disputed by\nthe employer (GE 2).\nApplicant asserted at the hearing that he has never compromised national\nsecurity during the more than 33 years, including his service in the Air Force, that he\nhas worked in the defense community. His security clearance has never been\nchallenged prior to this time.\nApplicant denied the rape. He also admitted at the hearing that he \u201ctook a little\nlicense with that definition [termination]\u201d that are now alleged as falsifications (Tr. 23-\n24). He admitted that his former company let him go after 22 years and there was \u201can\nembarrassment issue.\u201d He admitted that he was arrested in April 2001 but never\nappeared in court. He also thought the incident was expunged. He stated that his\nanswer was false but was not trying to deceive or cover up anything because it is a\npublic record. He stated he has nothing to hide. He further elaborated that there is no\nsecurity issue involved in his case (Tr. 24).\nWhen cross examined, Applicant maintained that he denied the SOR allegations\nin his answer to enable him to receive a hearing. He stated that he had the option of\nagreeing or denying the findings. He signed the Disciplinary-Termination form on\nOctober 18, 2002 (Tr. 38) and acknowledged that he was being terminated for cause.\nHe admitted that he was not totally up front with the questions and that he gave himself\nbad advice (Tr. 40). He agreed he was not totally forthright. He acknowledged that it is\nhard to get a job and he rationalized that even if he answered the questions \u201cno\u2019, there\nwould be an investigation\u2014\u201cits gonna [sic] come forth\u201d (Tr. 43). \nWith respect to question 23 (police record), Applicant admitted that he should\nhave answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed the April 2001 arrest and charge but he did not do so\nbecause he was embarrassed (Tr. 48). Applicant explained \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know that\narrest record was on \u2013 on my record. So that is the only explanation for that one\u201d (Tr.\n26).\nWhen Applicant was interviewed as part of his security clearance process, he\nstated that when questioned a second time (a year or so ago), he revealed and\nexplained his answers and rationale for those answers to the investigator. Applicant\nacknowledged that at that point the investigator presented Applicant\u2019s arrest record to\nhim. He stated that he was stunned to learn that it had not been expunged because the\n\n4\nwhole case was dropped. He then stated that \u201cso, I am guilty of \u2014 in the most fine\ndefinition of having falsified that document - yes\u201d (Tr. 26).\nApplicant\u2019s current employer recommends him highly. He is valued as a mature\nand professional individual. He is respected and has the complete trust and confidence\nof his employer. He is trusted with safeguarding classified material and decision making\nin that arena (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6\n16(a) provides:\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security eligibility or\ntrustworthiness or award fiduciary responsibilities\nAG 16(b) states:\ndeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical\nauthority, or other official government representative is a disqualifying \ncondition.\nApplicant was not credible in his testimony at the hearing that he did not intend to\ndeceive the government through the omissions to various questions. Applicant admitted\nhe lost his job due to his excessive claims for compensation. Applicant rationalized his\nefforts to mislead employers and security personnel with his answers to questions on\nhis July 2005 employment application, his September 2005 security application and his\nJanuary 2008 interrogatories. His explanation for not believing he was \u201cterminated\u201d was\nbased on the fact that he received unemployment benefits.  Applicant acknowledged\nthat he did not have any real basis for that belief. H also claimed the company wanted\nto let him go and used seniority as a reason. His explanations are not credible. I find\n\n6\nthat he deliberately withheld information about his termination to be hired and then to\nobtain a clearance.\nApplicant did not list his April 2001 arrest on his security application. His\nexplanation that he believed the record was expunged was not credible. He admitted\nthat due to embarrassment, he did not answer the question. He denied all the SOR\nallegations but at the hearing he explained he did that so that he could have a hearing. I\nfind that Applicant intentionally falsified his September 21, 2005, SF 86 security\nclearance application and his July 20, 2005 application for employment. Moreover, he\nfalsely denied the allegations in his SOR response\nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding.\u201d This disqualifying condition is not a factor for consideration because Applicant\nrevealed the incidents during his investigation in 2008.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically,\nAG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement\u201d is a factor for consideration in this case. Moreover, AG \u00b617(d) \u201cthe individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur\u201d does not apply. Thus, AG 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d is a factor for\nconsideration. Applicant has not mitigated his personal conduct concerns regarding his\nintentional falsifications. He tried to explain and clarify his answers, but I conclude he\nwas not fully forthright and candid at the hearing.\nAs recent as his 2008 interrogatories, he stated that he was not terminated but\nlaid off. He admitted he took a little license with his answers. He admitted\nembarrassment over the April 2001 arrest. He acknowledged that it would have been\nmore difficult to find employment in 2005 if he admitted he had been terminated in 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s statement at the hearing that the incidents occurred and he has cleared\neverything up and now everything is public record is not sufficient for mitigation. I do not\nfind that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated personal conduct security concerns through\nhis recent actions and behavior. \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his\nSF 86 on September 21, 2005, and his response to DOHA interrogatories in 2008 is\nrecent. He did not promptly inform the government of the falsification. No one advised\nhim to falsify his answers. He admitted the false statements at issue, and the\nfalsification of his documents is substantiated. The falsifications cast doubt on his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country in the\nU.S. Air Force and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance for\nmore than 30 years. He was employed with one company for more than 21 years. He\nhas a letter of recommendation from his current employer.\nHowever, he did not report truthfully on his security clearance application with\nrespect to questions 22 and 23. He also did not report his termination on his 2005\nemployment application. Applicant was embarrassed about the April 2001 charge and\narrest. He did not want the Government or his future employer to find out about these\nevents. In January 2008, he was not truthful and candid in his reply to a DOHA\nInterrogatory about the reason he lost his job in 2002. The fact that Applicant has held a\nsecurity clearance for many years does not excuse the personal conduct issue. This\nrecent falsification has a serious negative impact on my security clearance\ndetermination because it damages his integrity and trustworthiness.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and\nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, especially his contributions to his employer,\nand my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.\nOverall, the record evidence and whole person analysis leaves me with questions\nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\nhis personal conduct. I further conclude he is not eligible for access to classified\ninformation.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

WHITE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCandace Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid I. West, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005)\n1\nas modified and implemented by Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum of Aug. 30, 2006 for use in adjudication of\nall cases in which an SOR had not been issued by Sept 1, 2006. These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which is pending revision to incorporate them. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant\nwith the SOR.\n2\nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has an excellent work\nrecord, and has held a security clearance since 1979 without incident. In 1970, he was arrested on\nfelony charges of marijuana possession and distribution. He pled guilty, and served three years and\neight months of the resulting eight year sentence to imprisonment. Renewal of his security clearance\nis not clearly in the national interest only because of  the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant reapplied for a security clearance on July 26, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as a high-voltage electrician. On April 5, 2007, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The\nSOR detailed reasons, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary\n1\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\na security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a letter and notarized statement dated April\n20, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was then assigned\nto me on June 15, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on June 19, 2007. By letter dated June 22,\n2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney requested a continuance. Department counsel agreed to the request, and\nan amended notice of hearing was issued on July 5, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled on\nAugust 9, 2007. The Government offered six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits\n(GE) 1 through 6, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered nine exhibits that\nwere marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, and admitted without objection. DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr) on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT             \nApplicant admitted the truth of some factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\ncriminal activity under Guideline J (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c (in part), and 1.d (but requested a Smith Amendment\nwaiver)), and personal conduct under Guideline E (\u00b6 2.a). Those admissions are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c (in part), 1.e, and 2.b.\nAfter complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of\n\nTr at 112, 122. \n2\nGE1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated July 26, 2005) at 4-5; Tr at 101-\n3\n102. Note: GE 1 has several different pagination numbers noted on each page. Citations herein will be to the hand-written\npage numbers 1 through 22, on the bottom of each page following the unnumbered cover page. \nTr at 86-88, 103-111.\n4\nSee Tr at 19, 130-131, 135, 137-139.\n5\n3\nsame, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to renew a security\nclearance he has held since 1979.  He has proudly and successfully held his present position, which\n2\ndoes not involve access to classified information but does require access to sensitive areas, since\n1991.  He is married with a 21-year-old daughter who lives independently, and a 15-year-old son\n3\nwho is autistic. Applicant and his wife spend virtually all their time away from work caring for their\nson. His condition caused some stress in their marriage, but after counseling they have resolved those\nproblems and rededicated themselves to each other and their family\u2019s needs.\nAs Applicant admitted, in response to SOR \u00b6 1.a, that he was arrested on December 4, 1970,\nand charged with four felony drug distribution counts. He pled guilty to, and was convicted of, two\ncounts of Felony Possession and Distribution of Drugs. On February 24, 1971, he was sentenced to\nserve four years confinement on each, to be served consecutively for a total of eight years. He was\nreleased on parole after actually serving approximately three years and eight months in the state\npenitentiary. This conviction and sentence meet the criteria of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 (the Smith\nAmendment), precluding the grant or renewal of a security clearance without obtaining a meritorious\nwaiver.\nApplicant credibly testified that he has no recollection of the March 1975 misdemeanor\nmarijuana possession charge alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  However, GE 4 (where his parole officer\n4\nrecorded detailed descriptions of the arrest and subsequent nol-prosse determination in return for\nApplicant\u2019s cooperation in an ongoing investigation of burglary charges against his roommate), and\nGE 5 (where an independent Department of State Police Central Criminal Record reflects an arrest\non the identical date and charge), provide more than sufficient evidence, and I find that this arrest\ndid occur and Applicant admitted the offense shortly thereafter. Applicant, through counsel, asserted\nthat the absence of information concerning this incident in AE F (Applicant\u2019s FBI Criminal History,\ndated June 8, 2007) corroborates his belief that this incident did not happen. However, that same\nreport also does not reflect the 1976 marijuana possession arrest or resulting misdemeanor\nconviction, which Applicant remembers and admits. Accordingly, with GE 5 reporting the arrest,\nits absence from AE F is not persuasive.5\nApplicant admitted that he was arrested for marijuana possession in 1976, in a different state,\nshortly after his release from parole. This arose from a traffic stop during which the passenger in the\ncar he was driving was found in possession of the drugs. Applicant consented to a search because\nhe did not know the drugs were there. As the driver, he was also charged with marijuana possession,\nbut believed that it was reduced to a traffic violation with a $50 fine in return for his agreement to\n\nTr at 77-78, 88-90, 111-115.\n6\nTr at 35-39, 42, 72, 78-79, 99-101, 115-120, 123-125.\n7\nAE I (Evaluation report, dated May 14, 2007) at 2. See Tr at 46-65.\n8\nTr at 66-79.\n9\n4\nplead guilty.  GE 3 (the state Computerized Criminal History) reflects that Applicant\u2019s belief was\n6\nincorrect. In fact, he was initially charged with felony marijuana possession, found guilty (based on\nhis plea) of misdemeanor marijuana possession, and fined $25, plus costs. Applicant credibly\ntestified that he did not list this incident as a drug charge or felony charge in response to question\n23 on GE 1 (his e-QIP) because he thought the court\u2019s action reduced it to a traffic offense. He has\nnever reported this incident on previous security clearance applications for the same reason. He now\nunderstands it should be so listed, and will do so in the future. He has not tried to hide this arrest\nfrom his employer or family, all of whom know about it from his having told them. He simply did\nnot realize it should have been listed on the e-QIP. He did answer \u201cyes\u201d to questions 23a and 23d,\nand listed his 1970 drug felony.\nApplicant admitted that he tested positive for marijuana use on a random urinalysis test in\n1995 because he had shared a marijuana cigarette the preceding weekend while helping a neighbor\nwho was moving. He did this due to peer pressure from the others present, all of whom were sharing\nthe marijuana. He admitted the incident to his wife and employer, felt terribly stupid for having done\nit, and has not used marijuana or any illegal substance since then. He successfully completed a year-\nlong bi-weekly drug testing program but suffered no other job sanctions.  Applicant underwent an\n7\nAlcohol/Drug Evaluation by a Licensed Clinical Social Worker/Chemical Dependency Professional,\non April 26, 2007. The Evaluation/Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation stated that he:\nis diagnosed as demonstrating insufficient evidence of substance\nabuse/dependence. The test results and interview information were\nnot indicative of chemical dependency or abuse symptomatology. He\ndoes not evidence consistent loss of control, denial or any of the other\nattendant life problems that would suggest a problem with alcohol. It\nwould appear that their [sic] was a time in his early to mid twenties\nwhen he abused marijuana which led to his legal problems associated\nwith this drug. He has shown no propensity to resume this\nmaladaptive pattern of use and his problems in this regard are in full\nremission. He does not appear to be a heavy drinker and has no\nhistory of prescription drug abuse. He was given a [surprise]\nurinalysis and the results were negative to all substances including\ncannabis. . . Given that he does not currently meet clinical criteria for\nsubstance abuse or dependence there is no need for [Applicant] to\nreceive any alcohol or drug related treatment services.8\nAE A through E contain five declarations of co-workers and supervisors attesting to\nApplicant\u2019s excellent character, reliability and work performance. Another person with whom he has\nworked closely testified credibly to the same effect.  AE G contains 22 pages of awards, certificates,\n9\nand letters of appreciation further documenting his sustained quality professional performance since\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n10\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n11\n5\n1991.\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, under Guidelines J and E, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section\nbelow.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n10\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n11\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n12\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n15\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n12\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n13\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n14\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n15\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n16\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 (the Smith Amendment) prohibits granting or renewing access to classified information to\n17\npersons meeting the criteria of CC DC 31(f). In a meritorious case, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or\ndesignee, or the Directors of WHS, DIA, NSA, DOHA or designee may authorize a waiver of this prohibition. \nTr at 127.\n18\n7\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d  \n16\nCriminal conduct disqualifying condition (CC DC) 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses\u201d) applies to raise possible security concerns due to Applicant\u2019s 1970 felony arrest and\nconviction, 1975 misdemeanor arrest and 1976 misdemeanor conviction for marijuana possession\nand distribution. CC DC 31 (c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d) also applies to raise security\nconcerns from his admitted criminal conduct, regardless of ultimate judicial  disposition. As\ndiscussed below concerning the personal conduct guideline, I conclude that Applicant did not violate\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Finally, CC DC 31(f) (\u201cconviction in a Federal or State\ncourt, including a court-martial, of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\nand incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year\u201d) is a mandatory disqualifying\ncondition that applies due to Applicant\u2019s 1971 conviction and sentence to serve eight  years\nimprisonment, under which he was incarcerated for approximately three years and eight months.17\nAs conceded by Department Counsel,  Criminal conduct mitigating condition (CC MC)\n18\n32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does apply to mitigate security concerns under CC\nDCs 31(a) and 31(c).  His most recent arrest was more than 30 years ago. Although not alleged under\nGuideline J in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s last, minimal use of marijuana in 1995 was more than 12 years\nago, and any possible criminal conduct concern from it would also be mitigated under this CC MC.\nI specifically find Applicant met his burden of proving that such behavior is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  \nApplicant also established CC MC 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d) in mitigation of any remaining security concerns from his criminal conduct under CC\nDCs 31(a) or 31(c). However, as noted in CC MC 31(e), CC DC 31(f) may not be mitigated unless,\nwhere meritorious circumstances exist, an authorized authority (in this case, the Director of DOHA)\ngrants a waiver.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n19\nTr at 127.\n20\n8\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d19\nAfter considering all of the personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC), it is unclear\nwhich of them the Government found applicable to the 1995 positive urinalysis alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nThis was not alleged under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nalthough it clearly could have been if either or both of those aspects formed the basis of the security\nconcern. While Applicant admitted that this did happen, there is neither an admission nor record\nevidence that would support finding the violation of some written condition of employment, or\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. Thus, I find that no PC DC applies to this\nalleged conduct, and Department Counsel conceded that any security concerns arising from it were\nmitigated under Guideline E because it occurred 12 years ago.  I concur that PC MC 17(c) (\u201cthe\n20\noffense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) mitigates any security concerns arising from the 1995\npositive urinalysis, for reasons identical to those discussed above concerning CC MC 32(a). \nPC DC 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) requires deliberate\nomission of relevant facts, which Applicant established did not occur when he listed only the one\nfelony conviction in responding to question 23 on his e-QIP. He had no recollection of the 1975\narrest that resulted criminal charges being dismissed, and honestly did not think the 1976 arrest\nqualified as either a felony charge or drug charge due to his understanding of the court\u2019s action in\nthe case. \nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant is a mature, responsible family man and employee who is widely trusted and highly\nregarded. He was heavily and criminally involved with marijuana more than 30 years ago, for which\nhe went to prison. He has not been arrested or charged since 1976. He has held a security clearance\nwhile working in shipyards and other government facilities since 1979, without any security\nincidents. The criminal conviction that led to a sentence disqualifying him from clearance without\na waiver resulted from conduct in 1970. Applicant was formally evaluated by a Chemical\nDependency Professional and found to have no current dependency or abuse problems. However,\nhis security clearance cannot be renewed without a meritorious waiver under the provisions of 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986 (the Smith Amendment).

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 20, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial). \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \nApril 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on \nNovember 5, 2007, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of \na hearing. A letter was attached to the answer with some explanatory information. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated November 29, 2007, was \nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not provide any additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on March 13, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR 14 of the 19 allegations in the SOR \nof financial considerations specifically relating to delinquent debts. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 37-years-old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor \nsince September 2004 and now works as a program analyst. He did not hold a security \nclearance before his present SF 86 was filed. He is married with one child. He was \ndiagnosed as bi-polar in 1987 and was on medication until 1997 when he had \nprogressed to the point that he no longer needed it. He has been in good health since \nthat time with the exception of one medical event in 2004 when he was under stress. He \nwas unemployed and his income was low from 2000 to 2004. Part of that time he was \nstudying in a university. He does not have a university degree.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F of the Directive is that Applicant incurred \ndebts totaling over $38,000 which became delinquent and have not been resolved. He \nadmits to over $36,000 of the debts. None of the remaining delinquent debts have been \nresolved. He defaulted on student loans and two automobiles have been repossessed. \nThe largest single debt is approximately $14,000 and the smallest is $70.  \n \n \nApplicant avers in the answer to one interrogatory (Exh. 5) that he has \nconsolidated a number of these debts and is paying to a consolidator and three \ncreditors on a monthly basis. Even the smallest debts have not been resolved. He and \nhis wife have a combined monthly salary of $4,500 and have a remainder of $1,100 \nafter payments of living expenses as well as almost $1,000 on the delinquent debts \naccording to his financial statement in the interrogatory.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that Guideline F provides the standard for resolution of the allegations \nset forth in the SOR. It states: \n \nGuideline F Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report (Item 7). \nAt least 14 of the debts remain unresolved. The majority of his delinquent debts remain \ndelinquent. He has indicated in his interrogatory that some have been consolidated and \nare being paid but has provided insufficient documentation to show that this is occurring \nand that significant progress is being made to resolve his debts. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 (c).  \n \n \nFive Mitigating Conditions (MC) under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are provided and have \nbeen considered:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant provided no documentation in either his answer or through \ninterrogatories to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) to 20(e). His statement about his \npayments to creditors is insufficient because he did not provide documentary proof of \nsuch payments. Even if he had provided proof of such payments, those payments would \nnot be sufficient to mitigate financial considerations because of the magnitude of the \nremaining delinquent debt. Although his unemployment and medical problems contributed \nto his financial problems and were largely beyond his control, he did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances since his current employment, and AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply because there are not clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control, and he did not establish that he acted in \ngood faith to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because he did not provide \n\u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions previously discussed through application of the whole person concept. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. He has had health and \nunemployment issues which no doubt contributed to his financial problems. He may well \nhave made some progress in resolving the debts but has failed to produce reliable \nevidence to support his contentions. Applicant currently has substantial unresolved, \ndelinquent debt. He has had and now has sufficient income to make greater progress \nresolving the delinquent debt.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting \nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 57-year-old security officer has a history of financial problems that continues to exist.\nShe has not made any significant effort to resolve most of her 17 delinquent debts.  She intentionally\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to two financial-related questions on her security clearance applications(SF 86) when\nshe admittedly knew of the debts.  Mitigation has not been established.  Clearance is denied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn April 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn June 18, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was assigned\nto me on September 12, 2007.   A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 24, 2007, setting the\nhearing for October 23, 2007.  At the hearing the Government introduced four (4) exhibits\n(Government Exhibits (GX) 1-4).  The Applicant testified, but did not offer any exhibits. The\ntranscript was received on November 2, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 57-year-old security officer for a defense contractor.  The February 24, 2005\nSOR contains seventeen (17) allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and two (2)\nallegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Applicant admits all 17 allegations under\nGuideline F, but did not admit nor deny the Guideline E allegations. The Guideline F admissions are\naccepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. The absence of any comment to the Guideline\nE allegation is deemed a denial. \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT\nas to the status of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline F (Financial) \nApplicant has a history of 17 past due debts (delinquent, charged off, referred for collection,\nor reduced to judgment) to the following creditors in the approximate amounts cited: \n1.a. - Collection Account A -----------------------71.00. \n1.b. - Collection Account B ---------------------- $3,986.00. \n1.c. - Collection Account C -----------------------$83.00. \n1.d. - Charged Off Account D --------------------$1,531.00. \n1.e. - Charged Off Account E --------------------$75.00. \n1.f. - Charged Off Account F --------------------$788.00. \n\n3\n1.g. - Collection Account G ----------------------- $127.00. \n1.h. - Collection Account H ----------------------- $5,755.00 \n1.i. - Collection Account I --------------------------$4,075.00 \n1.j. - Collection Agency J ---------------------------$1,359.00. \n1.k. - Collection Agency K -------------------------$532.00. \n1.l. - Charged Off Account L ---------------------- $7605.00 \n1.m. - Charged Off Account ----------------------- $165.00 \n1.n. - Collection Agency N -------------------------$971.00. \n1.o. - Collection Agency ----------------------------$104.00. \n1.p. - Collection Agency P ------------------------ $1,464.00. \n1.q. - Collection Account Q ------------------------$1,417.00. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n2.a- Applicant falsified material facts on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) of\nNovember 28, 2005, as to Question 28 Your Financial Delinquencies [in last seven years], \"have\nyou been over180 days delinquent,\" to which Applicant replied \"No,\" and omitted any mention of\nthe delinquent debts cited under SOR 1.b., 1.c., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.q., above. \n2.b. - Applicant falsified material facts on her SF 86 November 28, 2005 as to Question 28\nYour Financial Delinquencies - [are you currently delinquent over 90 days], to which Applicant\nrelied \"No\" and omitted the delinquent debts cited in SOR 1.b., 1.c., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.q., above.\nPOLICIES \nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all\nnine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are \n\n4\ndenied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant. \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \"any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\" \nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is 57 years old security officer at a major defense contractor. \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admits, without explanations, all 17 allegations of\ndelinquent debts.  At the hearing, she admitted that the debts are still delinquent and that she has not\nmade any significant effort to resolve most of them.  The record indicates that some of the delinquent\ndebts resulted from her period of unemployment, which began in 2002 and ended in 2004, when she\nbegan her present employment with a defense contractor (Tr at 18).  During part of the period of\nunemployment, she received disability payments because of a bad back (Tr at 26).  She was also\ntaking care of up to four foster children, two of whom are still with her (Id.).  These are two boys,\nseven and eight.  She receives $630 per month for each boy.  She is seeking \"long-time\nguardianship\" which, if granted, would result in a lowering of the monthly payments to about $400\nper month (Tr at 22).\n \nShe was married in the 1970s and has three grown children, 40, 39, and 24 (Tr at 27).  The\nyoungest has medical problems and is unable to work. Applicant helps him out financially (Trat 27).\nAs Department Counsel read off the list of creditors, Applicant\u2019s reply and explanation was\nbasically that she admitted the debts but was unable to do anything about them, because of a\ncontinuing lack of funds (Tr at 29-38). \n\n5\nAt present, her income\nis just enough to make my bills - survive off of now \u2013and I was just not able\nto pay any of the bills right now. I am aware of the bills that I have to pay.\nRight now, I can\u2019t even see any light where I can put any money on the bills\n(Tr at 19). \nApplicant began making $59 payments on one account, but then stopped.  She does not deny\nthe bills, but states she has \"just had a bad time\" (Id.).  It has been several years since she was in\ncontact with some of the delinquent creditors (Tr 37-39).  I note that as to the creditors cited in 1.f.\nand 1.k., she purchased clothing and merchandise valued at $788 and $532, respectively. How she\nspends her income is, of course, her business, but in the context of her poor financial condition, it\nraises questions about her financial judgment and maturity. \nHer current monthly income is about $1,600 to $1,700. She also receives about $1,260\nintended for the care of her two foster children (Tr at 46 -55). She has no money left over each month\nand had to borrow money to come to the hearing (Tr at 55). She has no credit cards and no checking\naccount, no 401(k) and no savings (Tr at 56) \nOn cross-examination, she stated that she was a security officer for a defense contractor,\nmeaning she carried a firearm and patrolled the facility (Tr at 20). \nIn Applicant\u2019s own words, it is clear that she has been in a difficult financial position for\nsome years and there does not appear to be any likelihood of relief in the foreseeable future. There\nhave been many Guideline F cases in the past wherein an Applicant was unemployed or under-\nemployed and had minimal income.  In such cases, it is common for there to be difficulties in paying\noff debts, but many  Applicants have demonstrated some degree of financial rehabilitation.  This can\nbe accomplished by making arrangements directly with the creditors to pay off the debts or by using\nacceptable other means of resolving the delinquent debts. These arrangements include, but are not\nlimited to, filing for bankruptcy protection and seeking the help of a consumer credit counseling\nservice, to act in her behalf in resolving debts, often at a lower amount and in installments.  Such\neffort can be entitled to considerable weight in evaluating current eligibility.  In the present case, I\nhave carefully considered Applicant\u2019s credibility as to her intent and ability to resolve all of the cited\ndelinquent debts.  I am unable to give much credibility to her claims because she has done little or\nnothing to demonstrate serious action.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19 ( c)\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, have been established by the Government\u2019s evidence\nof record.  No mitigating conditions have been established.\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), SOR 2.a and 2.b., Applicant admits she was aware\nof the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and still knowingly stated \"No\" when asked about debts that\nwere more than 180 days delinquent within the previous seven years or currently more than 90 days\npast due.\n\n6\nHer explanations include claims of confusion and misunderstood advice.  What is most\ntroubling is her statement that she answered \"No\" because she did not know the exact status or\namounts due as to each and every debt.  But, the SF 86 does not contain any explanation for the \"No\"\nanswers.  When asked why she didn\u2019t answer \"Yes\" and attach an explanation about any lack of\ndetailed knowledge, she did not really explain her conduct.  I find her claim that a facility security\nofficer told her that it did not matter how she answered the two questions, to lack credibility.  In\naddition, in signing the SF 86, she swore that her answers to all questions were true, accurate, and\ncomplete to the best of her ability, and she knew she had not complied with this requirement.  \nThe record establishes, without rebuttal, that Applicant deliberately falsified her answers to\nQuestions 28.a. and 28.b., both of which were relevant and material to establishing her security\nclearance eligibility.  Disqualifying Condition 16.(a). the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . has been shown, but no\nmitigating conditions have been demonstrated. \nOverall, Applicant has not come close to overcoming the evidence supporting the\nGovernment\u2019s concerns, as stated in the SOR.  It is not necessary to question Applicant\u2019s sincerity\nto conclude that she has simply not demonstrated that she possesses the good judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows: \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nAgainst the Applicant\n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph l.e. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph l.g.\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph l.k. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph l.m. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p. \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph l.q. \nAgainst the Applicant\n\n7\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) Against the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b. \nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nBARRY M.

MARSHALL, JR.\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 53-year-old engineer working for a defense contractor. Married to a Chinese\nnational and with in-laws who are residents and citizens of China, he introduced no evidence and\npresented scant argument mitigating foreign influence security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and\nmodified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR). That SOR detailed reasons why, pursuant to\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\n\n The Government submitted five items in support of its case.\n1\n2\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. In his response, dated June 28, 2007, Applicant denied he \u201cfit the profile\ndetailed in Guideline B,\u201d but admitted to two of the three sub-allegations contained in the SOR. He\ndenied the third sub-allegation with an explanation. Additionally, he requested an administrative\ndetermination based on the written record.\nThe Government\u2019s case was submitted on July 26, 2007, and a complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant. He received a copy of the FORM on August\n1\n6, 2007, and was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional information in the form of a two-page document,\ndated August 24, 2007, and received on August 27, 2007. That submission was made part of the\nrecord without objection from the Government. I was assigned this case on October 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to two of the three allegations set forth in the SOR are incorporated\nherein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 53-year-old engineer. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1972 through 1978,\nwhen he was honorably discharged. From 1978 through 1982, he attended college. In May 1982, he\nreceived an Associate\u2019s Degree in Science (Electronics). He has worked as an engineer since at least\nthe mid-1980s. During most of his professional life, he has worked on sensitive military programs.\nAt one point in his career, he held a higher security clearance than the one sought herein without\nincident. He has worked as an engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since October\n2004.\nIn March 2003, Applicant met his future wife. She was an immigrant from the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, a communist country, and had been in the U.S. as a registered alien since\nDecember 2001. She is not a communist and she holds no favorable feelings for that government.\nWhen they met in March 2003, she was in her early-30s and working in a Chinese restaurant in a\nsmall U.S. city. He was immediately attracted to her and returned to the restaurant several times just\nto see her. Although he spoke no Chinese and her English was limited, they were soon conversing\nas best they could when she was between customers. In June 2003, he asked her out on a date. They\nenjoyed each other\u2019s company, and the two were engaged in November 2003. They were married\non March 4, 2004. On September 26, 2005, she was granted permanent resident status. She intends\nto apply for citizenship as soon as she is eligible to do so in September 2008. In the interim,\nhowever, she remains a legal citizen of China.\n\n The record is unclear, but it appears that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is the brother of Applicant\u2019s wife, and\n2\nhis sister-in-law is that brother\u2019s spouse.\n Id.\n3\n Government Ex. 5 at 6 (Testimonies: Personal Subject Interview of November 30, 2006).\n4\n Government Ex. 3 at 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated August 24, 2007).\n5\n Government Ex. 1 (Statement of Reasons or SOR) at 2.\n6\n Government Ex. 3, supra, note 5.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Id.\n9\n3\nThe parents of Applicant\u2019s wife are deceased. She has an uncle and aunt who are citizens and\nresidents of the United States. Remaining in China as citizens and residents are Applicant\u2019s brother-\nin-law and sister-in-law.  \n2\nApplicant\u2019s wife maintains telephonic contact with her family in China about once a week.\nThese calls are made by cell phone or through telephone calling card. Additionally, Applicant and\nhis wife visited his in-laws in China in the summer of 2006. He found them to be nice and he was\nwell treated, but communication was limited because neither spoke the other\u2019s language. His brother\nin-law works for a state run newspaper and his sister-in-law works as a teacher at a government\nschool. Neither has expressed any interest in Applicant\u2019s work.  Although Applicant has extended\n3\nan open invitation to his in-laws to visit the U.S., only the in-laws\u2019 daughters, ages seven and eight,\nhave expressed any interest. Applicant believes they have not visited because \u201cit is more difficult for\nthem to leave China than it is for him to visit them in China.\u201d  \n4\nDuring a November 30, 2006, interview conducted as part of Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation for a security clearance, Applicant was asked a question \u201calong the lines of . . . was [he]\naware of any means where [he] could be blackmailed or coerced.\u201d  The SOR alleges that in\n5\nanswering this question, Applicant \u201cstated that [he was] concerned for [his] wife should the Chinese\ngovernment discover [his] position [and that he] stated [he was] worried that the Chinese\nGovernment might order [his] wife to return to China.\u201d  \n6\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant sought to put his comments during the interview within\ncontext and to clarify his meaning. He wrote that he answered that question by stating:\n\u201c\u2018Hypothetically speaking\u2019 . . . . If the Chinese government knew who I was, [it] could threaten me\nwith forcing my wife to [return] to China. I do not recall saying I was worried about it, nor do I wish\nto imply that. As I consider it [to be an] extremely low probability, as I am a very small fish in a very\nbig pond, and I lead a very simple and quiet lifestyle.\u201d  Applicant continued by stating: \u201cI know the\n7\nthreat, and yes it is a concern. In that context, yes, \u2018I worry\u2019; however I also know about earthquakes,\nthat is also a concern. I worry about that to ]sic], yet I live 30 miles from a major fault line.\u201d  He\n8\nconcludes by stating he is not one to succumb to such a threat, that he understands the appropriate\nprotocol should such a threat be made, and feels the issue boils down not to the possibility of her\nleaving the U.S., but to whether legal assistance in keeping her in the U.S. comes from the U.S.\ngovernment or a privately retained attorney.  He also does not feel he is necessarily vulnerable to\n9\n\n Applicant\u2019s Answer to the FORM, dated August 24, 2007, at 1.\n10\n See FORM, attachments I-VI.\n11\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App Bd Jul 11, 1997).\n12\n4\nblackmail or coercion because his wife understands the sensitive nature of his work, and she knows\nnot to talk to him about his work or to discuss it with others.\nIn response to the FORM, Applicant again concedes that he is unable to refute the facts that\nhe married a Chinese national and that he has in-laws who are residents and citizens of China. He\ncontinues to argue that the interpretation of his interview answer that gives rise to SOR sub-\nallegation three, regarding his concerns and worries regarding potential actions by the Chinese\nGovernment, is inaccurate and illogical. He urges that he was simply being forthcoming and taking\ninto consideration all potentialities. He concludes by stating: \u201cIf having married a Chinese national\ndisqualifies me from having a clearance, I can understand that, its a bitter pill to swallow, but I can\nunderstand it, Being disqualified for answering a question knowledgeably and honestly, that I cannot\nunderstand. The logic behind it is flawed.\u201d  \n10\nFinally, the U.S. Government urges heightened scrutiny in this matter because the country\nat issue is China. Among other considerations, it specifically cites to the fact the U.S. is a primary\nintelligence target for China and to the two countries\u2019 long-standing rivalry. It further notes China\u2019s\npoor record on human rights. As part of the FORM, the U.S. Government included both U.S. State\nDepartment advisories regarding China, as well as three additional documents regarding intelligence\nthreats and assessments of U.S.-China economic and security reviews.  \n11\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances; it must be based on its own merits, with consideration\nof the whole-person concept, and in light of the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these\nfactors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the incident;(5) the extent to which the\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy\nguidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n12\n\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App Bd Dec 31, 1997), Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The burden of proof is something less than a\n13\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n14\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n15\ndecision.16\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n17\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n18\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n19\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n20\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\nthat is not in US interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country\nin which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline (AG) that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Regarding Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s citizenship and the citizenship and residency of his in-laws.  As for allegation\n21\n1(c), alleging Applicant has \u201cconcerns\u201d and \u201cworries\u201d regarding his wife, Applicant has plausibly and logically clarified\nwhat his wording to the interviewer was meant to convey. Thus clarified, his statement provides scant independent\ngrounds for denying a security clearance.\n6\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts,\nfactors, and conditions, I find the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nWith respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the Government has established its case.\nChina is a country which poses a heightened risk with regard to information gathering. Applicant\nadmits that his wife, with whom he presumably lives, is a legal citizen of China. He admits that she\nhas immediate family members who are residing in, and citizens of, China. He also admits that these\nrelatives, with whom she maintains regular contact, work for entities controlled by the Chinese\ngovernment. Such ties to a foreign government raise genuine security concerns under Foreign\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) AG 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion), AG 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligations to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information), and\n7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).\nWhen, as here, the Government\u2019s initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition\nraised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or\nmitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case. Here, Applicant does\nlittle to carry that burden with regard to his spouse and her relatives. Indeed, he is direct and forthright\nin his concession that his wife is currently a citizen of China. He is also forthright in his concession\nthat his in-laws are residents and citizens of China, and his admission that they work for state-\ncontrolled entities. Further, based on his own depiction, the relationship between his wife and her kin\nin China is apparently close, given the frequency and regularity of their telephonic contact. \nMoreover, Applicant concedes that the possibility exists that pressure could be exerted by\nChina or someone associated with its government upon his spouse. Although his written submission\nindicate he would react appropriately to any such measures, he has failed to address the Government\u2019s\nshowing that China poses a heightened risk, to what degree pressures could be exerted upon his in-\nlaws, or that there is no conflict of interest between his loyalties to his family and the United States.\nBy limiting his response to brief, written submissions, Applicant has failed to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to raise one of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI\nMC) available under AG 8(a)-(f) or otherwise overcome the case against him with regard to SOR\nallegations 1(a) and 1(b).21\nApplicant is a mature man who is seemingly aware that his marriage to a citizen of China\nraises genuine concerns regarding security risks. Although he articulated a solid argument to explain\nhis wording to an interviewer regarding \u201cworries\u201d and \u201cconcerns\u201d regarding his wife\u2019s potential\nvulnerability to a specific form of foreign pressure, he made little to no argument refuting the\n\n See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001), at 9, (mere possession of family ties with\n22\npersons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying under Guideline B. However, the\npossession of such ties does raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence\nof rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.)(emphasis added) \n.\n7\nGovernment\u2019s case regarding his wife\u2019s overall vulnerability, his in-laws, or the risk posed by China.\nMoreover, his limited responses failed to raise any of the specific mitigating conditions available\nunder the guideline for foreign influence. Consequently, Applicant failed to demonstrate that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.  Because any doubts\n22\nmust be resolved in favor of the national security, I find all the allegations, except 1.c of the SOR, in\nthe Government\u2019s favor. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.2.5 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born and raised in the U.S. to parents of Chinese descent who immigrated to the U.S. in 1979 (R.T., at 56). He earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering from a recognized U.S. university and has worked for his current defense employer since November 2004 (see ex. 1). Applicant is unmarried and has no children. His parents started a textile business in his home state when he was a young boy. He worked for his parents during his high school and college years (see ex. 2; R.T., at 59-60). While he was still in college his parents established a bullion company in Hong Kong to provide support for him in case the U.S. economy did not recover following the dot.com collapse, and Applicant wished to go to Hong Kong to work (see ex. 3: R.T., at 46-47, 60-61). Capitalization requirements are lower in Hong Kong for start-ups than they are in the U.S. (R.T., at 61-62).

The case was assigned to me on December 8, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 24, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nMarch 23, 2009\n\n2\nand four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on March 10, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is granted.\nBesides its four exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of eight\ndocuments:  Background Note: China, U.S. Department of State (October 2008);\nCountry Specific Information: China, U.S. Department of State (November 2008);\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, China, U.S. Department of State\n(March 2008); Annual Report to Congress from the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006 (August 2006); Intelligence Threat\nHandbook (Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC Support Staff\n(IOSS) (June 2004); 2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security\nReview Commission (November 2007); Background Note: Hong Kong, U.S. Department\nof State (September 2008); Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, U.S.\nDepartment of State (August 2008).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 12, 2006).  Administrative notice is\nappropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein,\nAdministrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). \nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the\nabove-named background reports addressing the geopolitical situation in Hong Kong.\nAdministrative notice was extended to the facts in the documents themselves that were\nreasonably not in dispute, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.\nThis notice did  not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of\nthe information contained in the reports addressing Hong Kong\u2019s current state.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have an uncle who is a citizen and\nresident of Hong Kong, (b) to have a business established in Hong Kong by his mother\nto support Applicant in case the economy in the U.S. stayed bad after the dot.com burst\nin the early 2000s, (c) to have a bank account in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2005\nthat was established by his parents, (d) to have traveled to Hong Kong in 1999 and 2001\nthrough 2006, (e) to have traveled to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 2001,\n2003, and 2004, and (f) to have traveled to Taiwan in 2004 and 2006.  \nFor his answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations.  He explained he had little contact with his uncle since his uncle\u2019s heart\nattack.  He claimed to have ceased his contacts with the company in Hong Kong\nestablished by his mother, in response to the Air Force\u2019s (AF) denial of his application for\na top secret clearance in January 2005.  And he claimed to have closed the bank account\nopened by his parents in Hong Kong.  \n\n3\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in the U.S. to parents of Chinese descent who\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1979 (R.T., at 56). He earned undergraduate and graduate\ndegrees in engineering from a recognized U.S.  university and has worked for his current\ndefense employer since November 2004 (see ex. 1). \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  His parents started a textile business\nin his home state when he was a young boy.  He worked for his parents during his high\nschool and college years (see ex. 2; R.T., at 59-60).  While he was still in college his\nparents established a bullion company in Hong Kong to provide support for him in case\nthe U.S. economy did not recover following the dot.com collapse, and Applicant wished to\ngo to Hong Kong to work (see ex. 3: R.T., at 46-47, 60-61).  Capitalization requirements\nare lower in Hong Kong for start-ups than they are in the U.S. (R.T., at 61-62). \nApplicant\u2019s mother opened a bank account with a $3,000.00 deposit in Applicant\u2019s\nname in 2002 (R.T., at 41-42, 64).   Between 1999 and 2006 he traveled to Hong Kong on\nvarious occasions to visit his uncle (his father\u2019s brother) who had serious health issues.\nHis completed electronic questionnaire for investigation processing (e-QIP) corroborates\nApplicant\u2019s claims that he traveled to Hong Kong: twice in 1999-2000, once in 2001-2002,\nonce in 2002-2003, once in 2004, once in 2005-2006, and once  in December 2006 (see\nex.1; R.T., at 55, 67-69, 74-76).  While in Hong Kong in 2001, he also traveled to the\nPRC.  During his visit to Hong Kong in 2005-2006, he closed the bullion business his\nparents opened in his behalf and the account his parents established in his name (R.T., at\n45, 63).  \nBesides his travels to Hong Kong in 2005-2006, Applicant has traveled three times\nto the PRC (in 2001, 2003, and 2004), and twice to Taiwan (in 2004 and 2006).  His\nparents always accompanied him on his Asian trips (R.T., at 75-76).  His trip to Hong\nKong in 2005 to see his uncle was the lone exception when his parents did not\naccompany him (R.T., at 76).  Since his uncle\u2019s heart attack in 2004, Applicant and his\nparents have maintained infrequent contact with his uncle (R.T., at 48).\nApplicant first applied for a security clearance in 2005 with the AF.  His application\nfor a top secret clearance was denied by the AF in August 2005 (R.T., at 44-46).  Once\nhe received his rejection notice from the AF, he transferred to another department that did\nnot require a top secret clearance (R.T., at 46).  After joining his new department, he\napplied for a security clearance through his employer.  His rejection for a top secret\nclearance was overturned by the AF in January 2007 (see ex. A; R.T., at 49-50).  By this\ntime, however, he had moved out of the department requiring the top secret clearance,\n\n4\nand did not need a clearance at this level any more.  Reciprocity based on the AF\u2019s\nactions with his top secret clearance in 2007 was not be available to Applicant on his\ncollateral clearance request because of his movement to another department that did not\nrequire a clearance. \nApplicant has excellent performance evaluations for the rating years of 2006\nthrough 2008 (see ex. B; R.T., at 53).  He owns a home in his State (purchasing it for\n$360,000.00 (see ex. C; R.T., at 72) and documents his mortgage payments (ex. C).  He\nmaintains a checking account with a U.S. bank in his State and has a 401(k) retirement\naccount valued at $25,000.00 (see ex. D;  R.T., at 72). \nNeither Applicant nor his parents currently have any bank accounts or business\nactivities in Hong Kong or any other foreign country (R.T., at 76-77).  Applicant has no\nintentions to transfer or place any assets in any Hong Kong bank or business entity.  The\nsame is true for his parents.  \nHong Kong\u2019s historical background\nHong Kong\u2019s history as a seaport and important trading center dates back over five\nmillennia.  It developed strong trading relationships with Britain in 1842 (following the First\nOpium War) under the Treaty of Nanking (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at\n2).  Britain was granted a perpetual lease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860\nConvention of Beijing, and expanded its control over the surrounding area under a 99-\nyear lease of the New Territories in 1898 (id.).\nIn the late 19  and early 20  centuries, Hong Kong developed as a warehousing\nth\nth\nand distribution center for British trade with southern China (see Background Note: Hong\nKong, supra).  Heavy migration to Hong Kong occurred after the Communist takeover of\nmainland China in 1949.  Hong Kong achieved considerable economic success as a\nBritish colony in the post-1949 period as a manufacturing, commercial, finance, and\ntourism center.  High life expectancies, literacy, per capita income, and a confluence of\nother \nsocioeconomic \nindicators \nserve \nto \nillustrate \nHong \nKong\u2019s \nmeasurable\nsocioeconomic achievements.\nHong Kong\u2019s reversion\nSince July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of\nthe PRC.  This is important to note because of the generally recognized heightened risks\nthat are associated with the PRC, and the unilaterally imposed citizenship and residency\nstatus on Applicant and his father as birth residents and citizens of Hong Kong before the\nreversion (see Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2).\nHong Kong today has a population of 6.92 million (95 per cent of which are\nChinese), and is one of the most densely populated regions of the world.  China has\ngiven Hong Kong considerable autonomy over its domestic affairs. The PRC has retained\nresponsibility and control over foreign and defense affairs.  State Department records\n\n5\nconfirm that the PRC has taken an increasingly active oversight role over Hong Kong\u2019s\npolitical developments.\nStill, both the Sino-British joint declaration (1984) and the basic Law provide\npolitical safeguards to ensure that Hong Kong retains its own political, economic, and\njudicial systems and unique status for at least 50 years after reversion and continue to\nparticipate in international conventions and organizations under the name of \u201cHong Kong,\nChina\u201d (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 2).  Hong Kong, with its quasi\nautonomy, remains a free and open society where human rights are respected, courts are\nindependent, and there are established traditions of respect for the rule of law (see id., at\n3).  \nCitizens of Hong Kong are limited, however, in their ability to change their\ngovernment, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies (see\nBackground Note: Hong Kong, supra). And the PRC still retains oversight and ultimate\nveto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making.  Any\nchanges in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (such as to achieve full universal suffrage) will require\napproval by Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive (currently Donald Tsang), at least a two thirds\napproval by the Legislative Counsel (Legco), and then the PRC\u2019s National People\u2019s\nCongress Standing Committee (NPSCS), which is by no means assured (see id, at 3).\nBecause Applicant\u2019s uncle is still a citizen and resident of Hong Kong with\nunilaterally imposed Chinese citizenship by the PRC\u2019s immigration law, his PRC\nconnections raise some heightened risk concerns.  Such concerns  become quite relevant\nto evaluating any potential security risks associated with Applicant and his uncle  because\nof the PRC\u2019s system of authoritarian government, its poor record for respecting human\nrights and the rule of law, and its collection activities that extend throughout its maintained\nintelligence operations in Hong Kong and Macau.\nThe Peoples Republic of China\u2019s country status\nEstablished in 1949, the PRC with over 1.3 billion people is the world\u2019s most\npopulous country.  Today it continues to undergo rapid economic and social change.\nPolitical power, however, remains centralized in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with\nlittle indication of any change in the foreseeable future.  China\u2019s 70.8 million strong CCP\nis authoritarian in structure and ideology and possesses increasingly sophisticated\nmilitary forces which continues to transform itself from a land-based military power to a\nsmaller, more mobile, high-tech military that eventually will be capable of mounting limited\noperations beyond its coastal waters (see Background Note: China, supra, at 6-8). \nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, the PRC\nmaintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC operates a\nlarge and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State Security (MSS)\n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook, supra, at 17).  These operations use clandestine\nagents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who are\nsuspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\n\n6\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities  (see Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, id., at 72).\nBased on past reports to Congress, the PRC is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information (see Annual Report to Congress\nfrom the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006,\nsupra).  The PRC is known especially to use its intelligence services to gather information\nabout the US and to obtain advanced technologies (see Intelligence Threat Handbook,\nsupra, at 17).  The PRC actively monitors international communications satellites from\nmaintained intercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on U.S. military\noperations and exercises.  Examples of PRC economic espionage are cited in the Annual\nReport to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic\nCollection, 2005-2006, supra, at 10-12).  Most of the examples of illegally exported\ntechnology to the PRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in missile and\naircraft guidance systems, highly sophisticated weapons parts, infrared cameras and\nmissile microchips. \n As a corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a\npositive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights\ngroups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any cognizable\ndemocratic traditions and the absence of respect for developing democracies and the rule\nof law.  State Department country reports on the PRC cite the country\u2019s poor human\nrights record.  Its noted historical abuses include the suppression of political dissent,\narbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners\n(see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, China, supra, at 2-9).\nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are the State Department\u2019s latest\nreports of increased high profile cases in the PRC involving the monitoring, harassment,\ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers\nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights (see Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2007, supra).  The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible\naccounting of all those killed, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in custody,\ndisappearance, torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\n(see id., at 2-3).  While the PRC officially denies holding any political prisoners, Western\nnon-government organizations estimate that approximately 500 persons remained in\nprison in 2006 for the repealed crime of counterrevolution, and thousands of others were\neither serving sentences or were being detained for counter-revolutionary offenses (id., at\n8). \nIn its November 2007 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage (see 2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review\nCommission, supra, at 104-06).  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire sensitive\ntechnology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence measures.  Recent\nindictments of Chinese/U.S. citizens for espionage have served to highlight the PRC\u2019s\n\n7\nspying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its own 2004 U.S.-China agreement, the\nPRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use items licensed for\nexport to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral in\nscope (see id.).  Without effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be\nexpected to acquire dual use technologies with military potential through the U.S. and\nother source countries. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \u201cMitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this\nGuideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism   See revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG), \u00b6 6.\n      Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continued \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a  threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\n\n8\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable\nand logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted facts\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must\ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant was born in the U.S. to parents of Chinese descent who themselves are\nnaturalized U.S. citizens who have long resided and prospered in the U.S.  Applicant\nreceived his undergraduate engineering training at a respected American university and is a\nhighly regarded engineer for a U.S. defense contractor.  Security issues of concern to the\nGovernment focus on the citizenship and residence of an extended family member (his\nuncle), and prior business and bank account start-ups in Hong Kong (which reverted to the\nPRC in 1997, a country known for its poor human rights record and its engagement in\neconomic data collection in Hong Kong and the U.S).\nThe Government\u2019s principal security concerns center on Applicant\u2019s immediate family\nmember (his uncle) who resides in Hong Kong (which has since reverted to the PRC) might\nbe subject to undue foreign influence by PRC authorities to access classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control. Because Applicant\u2019s uncle has PRC citizenship by virtue\nof Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC in 1997, he presents potential heightened security\nrisks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of AG \u00b6 6. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s uncle in what is now the PRC poses\nsome potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that\ncould compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control.  DC \u00b6\n7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\n\n9\nproviding that information,\u201d has possible application due to the  presence of Applicant\u2019s\nuncle in Hong Kong.  Although, Applicant has not seen his uncle since his last visit to Hong\nKong in 2005-2006, and has no current financial interests in Hong Kong or elsewhere in the\nPRC that could create potential conflicts of interest.\nApplicant and his family have deep roots in the U.S. (Applicant\u2019s birth place)  Hong\nKong (for years a British colony) is his parents\u2019 birth place and, as a former colony of Great\nBritain, is steeped in British culture, free markets, democratic government, human rights\nprotections, and respect for the rule of law.  Applicant has no contacts with or interests in the\nPRC.  His parents (as naturalized U.S. citizens) have a long-established U.S.-based\nbusiness with no links to the PRC.  And Applicant\u2019s only assets are located in the U.S.\nWhat business and bank account his mother established for him in Hong Kong have either\nbeen closed or are no longer in operation.  \nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s extended\nfamily residing in Hong Kong (with only his uncle identified as such an extended family\nmember residing in the country) have any political affiliations with the Hong Kong or PRC\ngoverning bodies.  Nor does his uncle have any history to date of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nThe citizenship status and presence in Hong Kong of Applicant\u2019s uncle poses some\nrisk because of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC\u2019 and the latter\u2019s sovereign oversight\npowers over all of Hong Kong\u2019s domestic affairs, and plenary responsibility over its external\naffairs.  Ths risks are manageable, though, and reconcilable with U.S. security interests.\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his uncle are more than neutralized by Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nstrong loyalties to the U.S. and manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security\ninterests and resist any family pressures that could weaken his fiducial duties to protecting\nclassified information.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Hong Kong. \nThe new AGs do take into account the  country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the\nU.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with\ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims\nand policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's uncle in Hong\nKong  (a Chinese sector that continues in a semi-autonomous way despite its reversion to\nthe PRC), any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\n\n10\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data\nout of Applicant through his uncle\u2019s residing in Hong Kong is a manageable one.\nFor Hong Kong, with its quasi autonomy, remains a free and open society where\nhuman rights are respected, courts are independent, and there are established traditions of\nrespect for the rule of law (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 3).  True, citizens of\nHong Kong are limited in their ability to change their government, and the legislature is\nlimited in its power to change government policies (id.). And the PRC still retains oversight\nand ultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making.\nBut since reversion, the PRC has essentially left Hong Kong to manage its own internal\naffairs without any interference from PRC authorities.  This deference is not expected to\nchange in the foreseeable future. \nApplicant, accordingly, may take partial advantage of mitigating condition: MC \u00b6 8(a),\n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d   Further, in the hypothetical situation where Applicant\u2019s uncle or any of his family\nmembers residing in Hong Kong or the U.S. were to be pressured, Applicant\u2019s strong\nloyalties and security commitments to the U.S. make it very unlikely that he would permit\nhimself to be pressured into compromising classified information. \nOf full benefit to Applicant also is MC  \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism,\nand professional commitments to the U.S., are well demonstrated and enough under these\ncircumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his relationship with his\nuncle, a Hong Kong resident and citizen of the PRC by virtue of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to\nthe former.   \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflicts\nof interests with his uncle in Hong Kong, and potential risks associated with his numerous\nvisits to Hong Kong and the PRC.  Not only is Applicant a U.S. citizen by birth and a\nrecipient of undergraduate and advanced degrees of a respected American university, but\nhe has made every effort to work, save, and pursue his financial interests exclusively in the\nU.S.  Applicant is highly regarded and trusted by his employer, from whom he has earned\nexcellent performance evaluations. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to\nbear on his uncle or any of his extended family members would appear to be minimal.\nAside from any risks associated with Applicant\u2019s trips to Hong Kong and his uncle\u2019s having\nHong Kong citizenship and residence, Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest with Hong\n\n11\nKong and the PRC or property interests in China that could be at risk to exploitation or\ncompromise by Hong Kong government authorities or PRC military or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's uncle residing in\nHong Kong are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's\nability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial relationships in Hong\nKong (now part of the PRC).  His demonstrated loyalties and commitments to protecting\nU.S. security interests, make it highly unlikely he would succumb to any foreign influence\nbrought to bear on himself or his uncle by PRC government or military officials.  Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole,\nincluding each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the Adjudicative\nProcess of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras 1.a through 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Fadi Toma, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn November 30, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 13, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing through counsel on October 16, 2007, and requested a hearing \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 18, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 9, 2007, and I received the \ncase assignment on December 3, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nDecember 19, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2007. \nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received into the record \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (Ex.) B through D, and G \nthrough I that were admitted into the record without objection.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 1, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 10-11.) The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Administrative Exhibits (AE) I through VII. Applicant\u2019s counsel \ndid not object to my consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively \nnoticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to \nreasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of \nFact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 16, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He was born in Algosh, Iraq, a region in the northern \npart of Iraq, commonly referred to as the Kurdish area. He attended high school and \nundergraduate college there, receiving a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Liberal Arts with an \nemphasis on languages. (Tr. 14).  As required by the Iraqi government, he served eight \nyears in its army after completing his education. (Tr. 42). \n \n \nIn May 1992, Applicant, his wife and two children immigrated to the United States \non a Family Visa because of the threat of religious persecution against Christians under \nSaddam Hussein. (Tr. 31). In July 1998, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His wife \nand two children also became naturalized U. S. citizens. Another child was born in the \nUnited States. All of his family lives in the United States. His wife\u2019s family resides in \nCanada. (Tr. 33). \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. He is one of four children, all born \nin Iraq. His three siblings are married, have families, and are resident citizens of Iraq. \nHis father is deceased and his mother, age 79, has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She no longer \nrecognizes Applicant and is not expected to live much longer. (Tr. 22-24). She resides \nwith his brother. His siblings are farmers and do not have any connections to the Iraqi \ngovernment.  (Tr. 26). Generally, he speaks to them once every four to six months. He \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nhas a long distance relationship with his siblings. \u201cThis is no [sic] like a close \nrelationship.\u201d (Tr. 22). \n \n \n \n \nIn November 2002, Applicant joined the U.S. Army as one of the first contractor \nlinguists to assist in the war on terror. (Tr. 34). He initially went to Kuwait and then \nreturned to Iraq in April 2003, for the first time since leaving it in 1992. He remained in \nIraq until January 2005 when he was sent to Qatar. He returned home in October 2005. \nPrior to going to Iraq, he received an interim Top Secret security clearance that allowed \nhim access to classified information. He took a polygraph test prior to receiving the \nclearance. (Tr. 47-48).  In describing his work with the Army, he stated, \u201cI think I did my \nbest to help. This is my country now. This is my home, so I decided to help our troops \nthere. I saved lives and prevented many injuries through my translations.\u201d (Tr. 18). \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant filed a Petition for Alien Relatives for his two sisters \nand their families. He did not file one for his aged mother or brother. While in Iraq, he \nspoke several times a week (over a period of a month) to his sisters about information \nneeded for filing the Petition after receiving letters from the U.S. Immigration \nDepartment. (Tr. 25; Ex. 3).  His sisters visited him twice while he was stationed in Iraq. \n(Tr. 32).  \n \n \nApplicant owns a house and a piece of property in the United States.  He also \nhas U. S. bank accounts. (Tr. 21). He does not own any property in Iraq. There is no \nderogatory information concerning his police or financial records. He has never been \nfired from a job. He has never been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs, or been \ninvolved in an alcohol-related incident. (Ex.1).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits attesting to his capabilities and contributions \nto the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the war on terror. According to his performance \nevaluations for the years 2003 and 2004, Applicant performed an outstanding job, \nexceeding expectations. (Ex. B). In November 2003, his U. S. Army commanding officer \nwrote, \u201cThroughout his tenure with us, he has performed his duties in an exemplarily \nmanner. . . Bottom line, [Applicant] has truly become indispensable to our operations.\u201d \n(Ex. C at 2). Another commanding officer noted in October 2004 that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201csuperior knowledge of the Arabic language helped facilitate and exploit raw intelligence \ninto actionable intelligence in support of Brigade operations.\u201d (Ex. C at 3). After working \nwith him for four months, a different commanding officer indicated that Applicant \u201chas a \nfirm grasp of the mission, knowledge of the country and culture, a great work ethic, and \ndedicated mission accomplishment.\u201d (Ex. C at 4). A captain in the Army stated \u201cI have \nnot met many men in my short twenty six years who compare to the moral turpitude, \ndevotion to duty and genuine care for the prosperity of a people that [Applicant] \nexhibits.\u201d (Ex. C at 1).  There is no evidence in the record that while holding a security \nclearance in Iraq, Applicant breached any security policies or procedures. \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship at his \nhearing and desire to resume his work with the U.S. Army. He currently works as a \ncashier.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have target the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  \n \nI also take administrative notice of the fact that the northern area of Iraq, \noccupied by the Kurdish people, has had a functioning democratic form of government \nfor approximately ten years. It is more stable, appreciative of the support of the United \nStates, and more friendly to the presence of the United States forces than other parts of \nIraq. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, three of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1  \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. \n \nIn this case, Applicant has contact with his three siblings, who are resident \ncitizens of Iraq. He has limited contact with his elderly mother because of her mental \nimpairment. He has sufficient familial connection to them, such that he has filed a \nPetition to help them immigrate to the United States. His relationship and contact with \nthree family members potentially creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because terrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are \nhostile to United States\u2019 interests. In addition, in 2004 his sisters visited him while he \nwas working in Iraq, which could have created a risk of exploitation at that time. \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have some application because Applicant\u2019s siblings reside in \nthe Kurdish area of Iraq, known to be more democratic and less hostile to the United \nStates. His relationships with those siblings have become more distant in nature, \nalthough he acknowledges that he is assisting his sisters with their pursuit of \nimmigration to the United States. His contacts with family members in Iraq are relatively \ninfrequent since 2004. Although there is a remote possibility that terrorists could attempt \nto coerce or threaten Applicant through his siblings, it is highly unlikely.   \n \nApplicant established application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since 1992 and did not \nreturn to Iraq until his employment with the U. S. Army in 2003.  The members of his \nimmediate family are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. He owns \nproperty and holds bank accounts in the United States. In contrast, his Iraqi interests \nhave become minimal over the years. He does not own property in Iraq and has limited \ncontact with his family members living there. There is no evidence that he has \nconnections or contact with any people other than his family members. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \u201c. \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, \nrehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this \nadjudication.2 Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \n                                            \n2 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nvarious human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists \nare hostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and \neven friendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s siblings and mother to \nobtain such information. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he \nimmigrated to the United States in 1992. Following his birth, he spent his formative \nyears there. He was educated at an Iraqi university and subsequently was conscripted \ninto its army. Third, his mother and three siblings remain resident citizens of Iraq. \nFourth, he has some contact with his siblings because he is trying to obtain resident \nalien status for them in the United States.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 15 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for about ten years.  His spouse has been living in the \nUnited States since 1992 and is a naturalized citizen, as are two of his Iraqi born \nchildren. One of his children was born here. Out of his sense of patriotism and love for \nthe United States, he joined the U.S. Army, as was one of the first Arabic-speaking \nlinguists. His ties to the United States, which he refers to as \u201cmy country,\u201d are much \nstronger than his ties to his three siblings and elderly mother living in northern Iraq. \nThere is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to \nthe United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he has \nworked diligently for a defense contractor for several years in an important capacity for \nthe U.S. Army. His supervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and \nresponsible, giving him excellent evaluations and praising his dedication to the cause of \nfreedom in Iraq. He is an excellent family member, employee and U.S. citizen. After \nleaving Iraq in 1992, he never returned, until he worked with the U.S. Army in April \n2003. No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance. There is not any \nderogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant held a security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army without \nany indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.3 Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n3 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b68 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n",

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie A. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has successfully mitigated the foreign preference concerns triggered by her use and\nrenewal of a foreign passport after she received her United States (U.S.) citizenship and passport.\nIn addition, her omission of material information from her security clearance application resulted\nfrom misunderstanding the question asked rather than a deliberate attempt to cover up her trip to Iran\nin April 2002. But Applicant has not successfully mitigated the foreign influence security concern\ncaused by her family ties in Iran. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, and partially modified by revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) made\neffective on September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR\nindicated that based on foreign influence (Guideline B), foreign preference (Guideline C), and\npersonal conduct (Guideline E), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine\nwhether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. On August 27, 2007, Applicant\nprovided her answer to the SOR and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 18, 2007. On October 24, 2007, this case was set\nfor hearing on November 14, 2007. The government submitted five exhibits (GE 1-5), and Applicant\nsubmitted two exhibits (AE A-B). Testimony was taken from Applicant and three witnesses. The\ntranscript was received on November 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the four allegations under paragraph 1 (foreign influence) and two\nallegations under paragraph 2 (foreign preference). She denied the falsification allegation under\nparagraph 3 (personal conduct) explaining that the missing information appeared under another\nquestion in the security clearance application (SCA). \nForeign Influence\nApplicant is 44 years old, and began working in August 2005 as a software engineer for her\ncurrent employer. She was promoted to her current position as task leader. Also, she has been an\ninstructor of a local university since February 2005. Applicant was born in Iran in 1963. Shortly after\nbirth, her parents took her to the United Kingdom where she lived with her father while he continued\nhis education. When she was five years old, her mother developed pregnancy complications with\nApplicant\u2019s unborn brother, and the family returned to Iran for medical attention, and to provide care\nfor Applicant\u2019s grandmother. At a later point (year not disclosed) in her life, she visited the United\nStates (U.S.) for a period while her father completed his veterinarians\u2019 degree.\nIn 1989 or 1990, when Applicant was 26 or 27 years old, her parents persuaded her to move\nto France to live with a family friend as they realized she was having problems adjusting to the\nIranian way of life. She met her soon-to-be husband in France, and they moved to the U.S. in May\n1990. They were married in June 1990. She gave birth to two children during their marriage that\nlasted until September 2002. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1994 and\nreceived U.S. passport in October 1996. In December 2003, Applicant obtained a graduate degree\nin management and information from a U.S. university, after having received an undergraduate\ndegree in engineering from a U.S. university.\nApplicant\u2019s sister, grandmother, and aunt are resident citizens of Iran (subparagraph 1.a. of\nthe SOR). Her sister, 45 years old, is a retired nurse. In the 17-year-period Applicant has been in the\nU.S., her contact with her sister has decreased from twice a year to sporadic. \n\n3\nApplicant speaks to her 86-year-old grandmother about twice a year. Before the grandmother\nretired, she was a math teacher at a private, high school. She supplemented her income as a tutor.\nThe grandmother has not initiated the emigration process to live with Applicant because she does\nnot want to be a burden. Applicant\u2019s aunt (his mother\u2019s sister) 64 years old, is a citizen of Iran\nresiding with Applicant\u2019s cousin in the western U.S. Occasionally, the aunt returns to Iran to visit\nApplicant\u2019s grandmother. \nApplicant\u2019s brother, a 37-year-old engineer, is a citizen of Iran, and was residing at a\nuniversity in the northeastern part of the U.S. (subparagraph 1.b.) until November 2007, when he\nmoved to the south-central U.S. He has applied for U.S. citizenship and is awaiting his interview.\nHe used to travel to Iran occasionally to see their grandmother, but has not been to the country since\nhis marriage in April 2002. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are dual citizens of Iran and the U.S., residing with Applicant in the U.S.\nThey are dual citizens as the government of Iran does not recognize U.S. citizenship. His mother was\nborn in Iran, and was a homemaker all her life. She is 66 years old. She became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in September 2001. Applicant\u2019s father was born in Iran in 1927. He is a retired veterinarian.\nHe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2001. Both parents have lived with Applicant since\nabout 2002. Both parents have returned to Iran on occasion to visit Applicant\u2019s grandmother.\nApplicant\u2019s mother has visited Iran six or seven times since 1992. Applicant\u2019s mother and father do\nnot travel together as one usually remains to babysit Applicant\u2019s two children. \nSubparagraph 1.d. of the SOR alleges Applicant traveled to Iran in April 2002 and May 1996.\nIn April 2002, she asked for a visa and received a passport by the Iranian authorities. In May 1996,\nApplicant used her Iranian passport to accompany her father back to Iran to visit a seriously ill sister\nbefore she passed away. Furthermore, Applicant needed a respite from raising two young children\nin a turbulent marriage while still attending school. \nRegarding the subject of returning to Iran, Applicant will not return for her grandmother\u2019s\nfuneral because her practice is not to attend funerals. Overall, Applicant\u2019s fear and distrust of the\nIranian government will prevent her from going back to Iran. Applicant predicted that if the Iranian\ngovernment tried to target her through detention of her mother, Applicant would report the incident\nto the U.S., even though her mother\u2019s dreadful position in detention would have a profound impact\non her. \nOn September 16, 2003, Applicant was asked several questions about her ties and contacts\nwith foreign countries or individuals. She responded:\nThe only persons I have sponsored into the United States have been my parents. I do\nnot maintain contact with any other non-US citizens, inside or outside of the US. I\nhave not been employed by any foreign governments, military, or contractors with\ngovernment connections. Neither my family nor I provide financial assistance to\nanyone residing in a foreign country or to financial educational institutions. I do not\nhave any financial interests in countries and do not have any financial obligations to\nforeign countries or persons. I do not maintain any cultural an personal ties to foreign\ncountries. I have never had contact with anyone representing foreign organizations\nor governments. Neither my family or I have never been imprisoned, detained, held\n\n4\ncaptive, or had property confiscated in foreign countries. Other than my parents, I\nhave not sponsored any foreign nationals into the US. I cannot be blackmailed,\npressured, or coerced based on my foreign connections (GE 5).\nIn response to question 17 of GE 3 (answers to interrogatories dated April 6, 2007) Applicant\nwas asked about her net worth. She responded that it was almost $180,000.00, which included a\nhome, jewelry, furniture, a Persian rug, savings account, and also taking into consideration a student\nand home loan. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have ever been an employee or agent of a\nforeign government. \nForeign Preference\nThe foreign preference allegations center around Applicant\u2019s renewal of an Iranian passport\non November 26, 2003 (subparagraph 2.a.), after she became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September\n24, 1994, and obtained a U.S. passport on October 16, 1996. Having compared GE 3 with\nApplicant\u2019s testimony (Tr. 85-89) about the circumstances surrounding the passport renewal, it\nappears that Applicant was reissued her passport because Iran does not provide visas to anyone born\nin Iran. Applicant admitted she used her Iranian passport for entry and exit from Iran in April 2002\n(subparagraph 2.b.) to attend her brother\u2019s wedding. Applicant felt obligated to attend because she\nis close to him, and she wanted to demonstrate her endorsement of the marriage. \nIn her sworn statement (GE 5) dated September 16, 1993, Applicant indicated she still had\nher passport and would relinquish it if necessary. Applicant made the same statement in an interview\nin May 2006 (adopted by her on January 19, 2007 in her answers to interrogatories). At the hearing,\nApplicant reiterated her position to turn over the passport because it expired in June 2007. She kept\nthe passport for one reason:\nI only kept it sir, just because I didn\u2019t want to come to you and say I put it in the trash\ncan. I wanted \u2013 If someone wants to have the information about it I though maybe as\nthe question [Department Counsel] asked, when did it expire, if they wanted to see\nanything about it, I wanted to make sure I still have to \u2013 if it\u2019s needed for any reason\nfor this hearing. Otherwise, I have no need for it (Tr. 90). \nConsidering the record including Applicant\u2019s credible testimony, I find she is willing to\nsurrender her passport.\nPersonal Conduct \nParagraph 3.a. alleges that Applicant answered Section 18 of her April 2006 SCA falsely by\nnot disclosing all foreign travel. Though the allegation is technically correct, a closer examination\nof her responses reflects she placed the missing information under Section 17: Your Foreign\nActivities. After answering \u201cYes\u201d to the question of having an active foreign passport in the last 7\nyears, Applicant provided a statement in the explanation space of the module that addresses her\ntravel to Iran in April 2002. She stated:\nThe dates in the dates of activity field above (3/2002 to3/2007, Iran) are the time the\npassport has been active. I had no involvement or contact with any government\n\n5\nagency or person. I went for a short visit to attend a wedding. I asked for a visa since\nI am a U.S. citizen and would require a visa to travel there. They sent me a passport\ninstead. I have thought about sending the passport back, however I was concerned\nthat this may trigger suspicion and hassle from that government (GE 3, p. 26).\nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and conduct during her testimony regarding the\nmissing information, I find Applicant did not intend to conceal the missing information.\nCharacter Evidence\nThe supervisor of Applicant\u2019s division has known Applicant since July 2005 when they met\nat a job fair. According to the supervisor, Applicant is an exemplary employee who is dedicated to\nher work and who warrants a position of trust. The program manager has known Applicant\nprofessionally for about two years through their work on the same projects in different jobs. The\nmanager believes Applicant is an excellent systems engineer who deserves to work in a position of\ntrust. Based on conversations with her, the manager recalled her indicating she is not supportive of\nthe Iranian government. Nor does the manager believe she could be pressured into doing something\nwrong. The business operations analyst has worked next to Applicant\u2019s work station for about two\nyears. She has found Applicant to be punctual and very professional in the conduct of her job\nresponsibilities. In observations of Applicant over the last two years, the business analyst opined that\nApplicant does not appear to be the type of person who could be coerced to do something she was\nagainst. \nOfficial notice has been taken of the following informational resource material concerning\nIran:\n1.

However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nForeign Influence (Guideline B)\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, or may be manipulated to help a foreign entity in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure by a foreign interest. \nForeign Preference (Guideline C)\n\n7\nActing in way that shows a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be\nprone to make decisions that are harmful to the U.S.\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nConduct involving questionable judgment, dishonesty or a lack of candor. \nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe FI guideline focuses on an individual\u2019s divided loyalties that may be manipulated to help\na foreign entity in a way that harms U.S. interests or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Adjudication under this guideline should consider the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s sister and grandmother are resident citizens of Iran. Applicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen\nof Iran now living with Applicant\u2019s cousin in the U.S. In addition, Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen\nof Iran living in the south central part of the U.S. FI DC 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion) applies even though Applicant\u2019s aunt and brother are no longer residents in\nIran. Applicant\u2019s aunt still occasionally travels to Iran. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are dual citizens of Iran and the U.S. residing with Applicant in the U.S.\nFI DC 7.d. (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\napplies. Applicant\u2019s mother has returned to Iran on six or seven occasions and is currently in the\ncountry. Her father has traveled to Iran on several occasions also. Applicant\u2019s two trips to Iran\nin1996 and April 2002 are more relevant to the FP guideline as showing a foreign preference than\ninfluence and shall be discussed under that guideline. Subparagraph 1.d. is found for Applicant.\nFamily contacts and ties with persons in a foreign country are not automatically disqualifying\nbut require the applicant to present evidence in mitigation and extenuation that show she qualifies\nfor a security clearance. Iran\u2019s enmity for the U.S. and poor human rights record place \u201ca heavy\nburden of persuasion\u201d on an applicant to show his family members do not pose a security risk. See,\nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \nThe only mitigating condition that receives serious consideration here is FI MC 8.a. (the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be place in a position of having to choose between the interests of the foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and interests of the U.S.) Even though there is no evidence that any of\nApplicant\u2019s family members who are citizens of Iran are employees or agents of the government or\n\n8\nany foreign power, Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran are at risk of being brought under control or\nexploited by an Iranian intelligence service. Hence, insufficient evidence has been presented by\nApplicant to conclude that the positions or activities of these persons in Iran are such that it is\nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the family member or\nentity and U.S. interests. \nSecurity concerns associated with foreign influence may be mitigated under FI MC 8.c.\n(contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation). However, regarding\ncontacts with foreign citizens who are immediate family members, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthe contacts are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Though her contact\nwith her sister and grandmother is limited, Applicant\u2019s evidence has not rebutted the presumption.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. and Paragraph 1 are found against Applicant. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nThe concerns of the FP guideline are actions that denote a preference for a foreign country\nover the U.S. Applicant\u2019s conduct warrants the application of the FP DC 10.a.(1) (exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member; including but not limited to possession of a current\npassport). As set forth in 2.b., Applicant used her Iranian passport in April 2002 for her brother\u2019s\nwedding. This action occurred after Applicant became a U.S. citizen in September 1994 and received\nher U.S. passport in October 1996. Applicant engaged in additional actions showing a preference for\nIran by renewing her foreign passport (2.a.) in November 2003. \nThe government has provided substantial evidence to establish FP DC 10.a.(1). The burden\nthen shifts to Applicant to rebut, mitigate or explain the facts in attempting to meet her ultimate\nburden of persuasion of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her\na security clearance. Since Applicant\u2019s actions in April 2002 and November 2003 occurred after she\nreceived her U.S. citizenship and passport, FP MC 11. c. (exercise of the rights and privileges, or\nobligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor) does not apply.\nWhen Applicant provided her sworn statement in September 2003, she volunteered to\nrelinquish her Iranian passport. The record is silent on whether she had been made aware that\npossessing a foreign passport and/or using the passport (April 2002) could result in denial of a\nsecurity clearance. Throughout the security investigation, Applicant has restated her desire to\nrelinquish her passport. While describing her strong beliefs not to return to Iran at the hearing, she\nrenewed her offer to surrender her passport that had expired in June 2007. I conclude the totality of\nher conduct in relinquishing the passport, combined with the strong evidence of her clear preference\nfor the U.S., as demonstrated by her U.S. citizenship for 14 years, her children\u2019s U.S. citizenship,\nher successful completion of undergraduate and graduate school in the U.S., and her U.S. property\ninterests, justify formal findings in her favor under FP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) and subparagraphs 2.a.\nand 2.b. Paragraph 2 of the SOR is resolved in her favor.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\n9\nThe security concern of the PC guideline is behavior that manifests poor judgment and\ndishonesty during the security investigation. Supplying incomplete or incorrect information on an\nSCA is addressed under PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from a personnel security questionnaire to determine security clearance\neligibility) Unquestionably, Applicant did not include her 2002 trip to Iran in Section 18: Foreign\nCountries You Have Visited, in her April 6, 2005 SCA. However, I do not conclude she deliberately\nomitted the information. Generally, when and applicant deliberately omits information from an SCA,\nthat information does not appear in any other area of the SCA. However, the missing information\nabout Applicant\u2019s trip to Iran is supplied in her response to question 17 of her SCA. It is clear to me\nthe information missing from question 18 resulted from inadvertence rather than intention. With the\nelement of deliberateness not present in PC DC 16.a., subparagraph 3.a. and Paragraph 3 is resolved\nin Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nIn reaching my decisions under the FI, FP, and PC guidelines, I have carefully evaluated this\ncase under the general factors of the whole person model found at pp. 18 and 19 of Enclosure 2 of\nthe Directive. Those factors include: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, including knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral factors; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure or\ncoercion; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant\u2019s praiseworthy job\nperformance evidence from supervisors or coworkers has been considered. Applicant has mitigated\nthe government\u2019s evidence presented under the foreign preference and personal conduct guidelines.\nHowever, given the theocratic nature of the Iranian government, where authority is vested in a few\nofficials, combined with the Iranian government\u2019s hostile relationship with the U.S., its poor human\nrights record, and Applicant\u2019s contacts with immediate family members in Iran, the foreign influence\nconcerns have not been mitigated. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C): \nFOR THE APPLICANT.\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor the Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cervi Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(e-QIP) dated February 2, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 5).  On July 27, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 11, 2009, in which she\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on September 17, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit\ninformation in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the FORM on September 23, 2009, and she submitted a reply on December 3,\n\n2\n2009.  The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on December 4, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR\nand the exhibits.  The Applicant is 46 years old, and married.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor as an Administrative Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the fifty-six delinquent debts set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.  (Government Exhibit 4).  Her delinquent debts total approximately\n$86,000.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated April 1, 2006, and March 2, 2009,\ncollectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government\nExhibits 9 and 10).  \nThe Applicant has offered no evidence to explain how or why she became\nexcessively indebted.  Some of the delinquent debts in the SOR date back to at least\n2000.  She did explain that she was unaware of the number of delinquent debts she had\nwhen she completed her security clearance application because she had never seen\nher credit report.  She also stated that some of the delinquent debt concerned medical\nbills that she thought should have been paid by the insurance company or were charged\noff several years ago.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 6).  She provided no further\nexplanation.  \nOn May 13, 2008, the Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy and contends\nthat most, if not all, of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are included in the\nChapter 13.  (Government Exhibit 8).  On August 13, 2008, an amended Chapter 13\npayment plan was approved.  On February 6, 2009, the Trustee filed a motion to\ndismiss the petition because the debtor failed to make payments pursuant to the\nChapter 13 plan.  Applicant stated that she fell behind on her payments under the plan\nbecause of the periods that her husband and daughter were hospitalized.  She states\nthat she had made arrangements with the Trustee to make up necessary payments to\n\n3\navoid dismissal of the plan.  Applicant has provided no documentation to support her\nassertions. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy records reflect that she earns $3,122.72 monthly, her\nhusband earns $3,649.10 monthly, and they have a combined net monthly take home\nincome of $6,771.82.  There is no evidence in the record to reflect whether her net\nincome will adequately cover her current monthly expenses as well as the Chapter 13\npayments.   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n\n4\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\n\n5\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant is currently indebted to at least fifty-six creditors in the amount of\napproximately $86,000.  She has filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy relief and states that\nshe is following the payment plan.  However, there is evidence in the record that shows\nthat she has been inconsistent in her payments after only one year of a five year\npayment plan, and that she had been unable to make the payments due to other\nhardships that she has not adequately explained.  There is no evidence that she has\nfollowed the payment plan.  A promise to take remedial measures in the future is not\nevidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that she can even afford to make her payments to the trustee in addition to\nher regular monthly expenses. \nAs of yet, none of the delinquent debts in the SOR have been paid.  The\nApplicant is just starting the financial rehabilitation process and obviously has a long\nway to go before her delinquent debts are resolved.  At the present time, she has not\npresented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or\nthat she has resolved her financial indebtedness.  Considering all of the evidence, the\nApplicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nthat is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThe record is void as to any evidence in mitigation.  There is no evidence of\nfinancial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nDisqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and, 19(c) a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions\napply.  Her financial problems remain current and they are not isolated.  The Applicant\nhad not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve her debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \n\n6\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.
